RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"hey skum, i've an idea for a run that i don't think was done before with some modding tools, change the light attacks of all weapons to the failed backstab animation where you start the animation but don't get the grab. it's slow and doesn't deal a lot of damage so it might be fun."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,bro at 10754 asking for a feet cam
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"did ranni quest but no ranni ending, damn..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"skum, the drip is real"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,you're telling me he beat the game on ng 1000 but hasn't done a use what you get randomizer
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"release the ng1k no hit, were not asking anymore"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"where's the ng10000, negative stats, ricketty shield, randomizer hitless run?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,yo this was so fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"simple, clean, no major spoilers and no ridiculous rambling. always one of the best for souls content"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this is easily the most helpful guide out right now. and good luck to the folks who are starting their very first souls game with elden ring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"they're not blockin the path, they are the path is one of the best realisations about how to play soulsborne games. thanks for the guide."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"they aren't blocking the path, they are the path. good philosophy to live by. reminds me of an old roman proverb the impediment to action advances action. what stands in the way becomes the way."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"tree sentinel was the most humbling boss for me, i played the samurai class and every engagement ended in about 2 hits. i spent hours fighting him, not moving from the opening area, when i decided to move past him until i get a better shield. i explored caves, cleared out encampments and even fought other mini bosses until i got a 100 physical defense shield. after that i returned and beat tree sentinel like he was a walk in the park. if anything elden ring taught me that it's okay to explore and return to bosses when you're better equipped. you don't have to slam your head into a brick wall and i think this design philosophy makes it one of, if not the most accessible soulslike to newer players and i'm all for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this video is the modern day equivalent of reading the manual on the way home from blockbuster. your channel is relaxing and engaging. thank you for making videos.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-06,"one more key tip you do not have to fight everything, its okay to run away from the big baddies and come back when youre stronger. i spent the first three hours of my playthrough trying to kill the tree sentinel and made no progress."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-07,"some more tips not mentioned. sorry i'm late. 1 most smithing stones for upgrading armaments can eventually be purchased infinitely once you acquire a special item called a stone bell bearing. these are exchanged at round table hold with an npc who sells useful things. once you give the npc a stone bell bearing, they'll sell you unlimited smithing stones corresponding to the tier of the stone bell bearing. look for small circular symbols on the map with a slightly orange highlight, they indicates its a cave. stone bell bearings are mostly found in caves. and more difficult areas give you higher tier bell bearings to exchange. what this means is that contradictory to what was said in the guide, you can actually upgrade as many weapons as you want later on, so don't be scared, it is not a finite resource. 2 a good indication that your dodge roll is going to be fast enough and that your armour isn't too heavy for your character is that you'll see it says light, mid or heavy under your weight category. if it says heavy then your armour is going to slow your dodge roll. forget the 70 thing. just read that tool tip. if you equip armour and it knocks up your weight load to heavy, consider leaving it unequipped until you've got enough endurance stat to carry more. also regarding weight, if you equip multiple armaments, it adds to your weight, even when you switch out the armaments. so while it might seem cool n fancy to have so many weapon slots, it might not be practical to use them all. stick to one or two weapons. 3 you can backstab if you light attack an enemy from behind or critical strike them if you light attack them from the front after you break their armour and they become briefly wounded. eventually you'll get a talisman that can heal you whenever you get a critical strike, which helps immensely with sustaining your health during long encounters and you don't want to use all your flasks. 4 your actual inventory is limitless and adds no weight to your character. so don't be scared to hoard up all your findings. there really is no need for a stash in elden ring although there is one if that's your thing 5 don't immediately usesell your golden runes. stockpile them until they're required. you'll lose your currency on death, but runes are kept. i made the mistake of selling all of mine for about 130k and died shortly afterwards. losing it all . when i could have just kept them in the inventory and sold them off when i was in a safer location and could level up or spend them for items. 6 if your gonna play a melee focused build, regardless of strength or dexterity, consider investing most of your early attributes on vigor first. you'll need the health, trust me. your damage scaling should mostly come from armament upgrades in the early game that's more than enough. won't be until later you start dropping it all on your damage scaling stat. strdex based on weapon. feel free to add more tips here in the reply section to my comment. cheers  have a good one"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i love the guard counter mechanic, paying attention to a bosses combos and blocking that final hit to perform a guard counter adds so much to the flow and learning in combat, very satisfying."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"as someone who has never played a souls and for we reason finding myself oddly very curious about elden ring, this was invaluable. thank you for making this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-22,"every youtuber should watch these videos as a guide. no dumb graphics or intros and this guy has such a great, calm voice for these videos. love it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"small piece of advice for handling your mount in order to doublejump, you have to jump first. falling doesn't enable it. if you fall off a cliff while riding your steed, you won't be able to doublejump because the game registers falling as being different from jumping. instead, if you want to doublejump near a landing spot below, you have to make sure you jump off the ledge, not just run off."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this is exactly how i would want the basics taught to me if i were starting this game without experience. great guide!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i'm glad people like vaati are putting these out, i've seen full on reviewers say things like i got a new weapon and it did less damage than the one i was using, as a legitmate critique of the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i'm a souls vet, but holy moly i am so damn rusty this time around. got my ass beat by tree sentinel like 10 times in a row. i will persevere!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,"this is the best elden ring beginners guide out there at the moment. thanks for putting in the time and effort to create such an accessible, spoilerfree handbook for new players."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"haven't even gone to margit yet 6hrs in, the open world is so filled with fun stuff to discover and good bosses to fight"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i love how they take different mechanics from every game before elding ring, so good"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"thanks for this, man. elden ring is my first souls game. im absolutely loving it so far and am slowly but surely getting used to the combat, and this video is great help. tbh i was worried id wind up getting frustrated by now but even when im repeatedly getting my ass kicked, im having a blast. its tough but fair, and i can tell that if i keep at it, pace myself, and dont get cocky, eventually ill win. i think im starting to understand why people like these games so much"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"12 hours into the game though never having played any souls games and this video has so many good tips that i hadn't really thought about. thanks  i wasn't sure if this game was for me, as i've not been too enamoured with open world rpg's in the past, but this really is something else. haven't been this captivated by a game in years. most interesting thing i learned here is that i'm really not paying enough attention to my stamina in combat!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"you have a calm voice, get to the point without rambling or over explaining and the content is fantastic. i've never played a dark souls game and i'm downloading elden ring as we speak so there! you have my sub! thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"1532 smal note here, you can find a ashes of war skill that removes the skill from a weaponshield, so if your favorite shield has parry on it and your not using the parry, add the ashe of war no skilll to it and remove parry so your main weapon can use its ashes of war while you stil have your shield equiped!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"one extra tip, certain enemies like those made of stone or in mines, take way more damage from strike weapons like the mace, so try a strike weapon if your sword is struggling"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-29,"one of the most actually helpful beginners guides for any game ive come across, ty"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"just starting my elden ring journey. i'm a soulsborne vet, so alot of this stuff looks familiar. but i'm glad for any advice vaati has to give. always my goto source for everything dark souls. thank you vaati"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"masterpiece of a game, taking every good thing from previous games and adding even more."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"this game is just so good so far, ive never been able to beat a souls game i always fall off about halfway through even though i love it. none of those problems are present here, it turns into dark souls when you want it to while letting you breathe in between. this might be the first one i complete."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-11,"ive never played a souls game and just picked up a ps5 so i dove head first into elden ring. so far im absolutely loving it, its so incredibly cryptic in terms of not guiding the player or explaining much which i actually love and find very refreshing. so many games now spend the first chunk of the game hand holding for every little function, the gameplay reminds me of nes games where you just start the game and figure out what to do for yourself. my only gripe was not having played a souls game before i was overwhelmed with feeling like i was missing out like i had to have played one of the previous games to get the lore or understand what to do but im about 5 hours in now and im hooked."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,i accidentally found myself at round table hold and totally missed margit the fell altogether. turns out you can go around a cliff path on the right side of the castle. what an amazing game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,ive never played a souls game and im so lost but im having a blast lol beat my first boss. im hooked
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"my advice for people new to the genre is to name all of the moves that are killing you, if you name them, youll find the work of memorizing is trivial. oh no hes doing the butt slam!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-18,"you are probably one of the best content creators in this entire platform, which is saying a lot. straightforward, easy to understand, and you explain everything extremely well. also, you have a nice voice. i couldnt be more glad about finding your channel, you are a huge help in understanding the complex system of stats and attributes, which is my biggest struggle so far. thanks d and sorry for the ranting"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,i was stuck at a boss and i realized when i got trap in the area that prevent you from fast traveling i got 1 red scarlet buff. it ripped right through the boss. fromsoft games really do teach you that no matter how impossible a boss is that with a little preparedness you can get through
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"this is a good guide for those starting out. my only addition to it would be, get a lantern. seriously, while the game is more vibrant than previous souls game, it does feature a lot of dark locations, from caves to dungeons, even outdoor areas can get dark in places covered with shadeshadows and during the night. the lantern can be acquired relatively early and it helps free your other hand for shield or secondary weapon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,"thanks for this guide my friend, other ones that i watched scared me into not wanting to play as much. this explained things much more clearly and in a manner that made sense to someone whos never played before. im 2 hours in and already loving it, time to explore and master the basics!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-09,what an intelligent and elegant beginner video. this guy sets a new bar for explainers on youtube. wish everything sounded like this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i feel like the most important piece of advice i ever received for a soulsborne game was do not worry about your losing souls. that is all a mind game designed to mess with you. they aren't actually as big of a deal as they seem, and you will always be able to get more. and you will always regain any lost souls much faster then you think you will."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"i remember seeing this idea back in dark souls when you can choose to go to the catacombs or undeadburg. though one could argue there really isn't much choice there, but i think elden ring is the realization of that freedom and i am glad i went into this blind. games have sorely missed their discovery element over the years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"this game is so huge. so many secrets, lore and things to do. ill never get tired of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-08,this game was my first experience into this genre of gaming. it has been a rough one. i was overwhelmed and confused and angry because it seemed like everyone was stronger than me and i didnt know what steps i needed to do to get better. this guide is hopefully going to help me and get me better because the game is wonderful
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"this man even has markers within the video playbar amazing. everything about this breathes clean, concise, and organized as a guide could ever hope to be. fantastic job, i'll be sure to check on you for more"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"for those that started as samurai class i've found that, with the uchigatana, fighting on the ground vs mounted opponents is more efficient. this is because although you do have a dodge on horseback you have more freedom of movement than the horse does and both unsheathe attacks lbrb or r1 let you tag the horse and it's rider when they start to move after an attack. i'd presume that this would also work with gs, ugs, halberds etc. if they attack fast enough. edit i forgot to mention but obviously it also removes the vulnerability from being dismounted and the extra flasks used to resurrect your mount."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"so cool this made it on bandai's channel! thanks for the tips good sir and happy lore hunting! note smithing stones are sometimes dropped by godrick soldiers in the starting area, limgrave!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"finally, a real beginners guide. thank you and thank you for all the wonderful content you make!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"as a new souls player, every time i watch this, i can't wait to get back into the game! it's so... welcoming."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"elden ring has been my introduction to soulborne games, and it has been a rough one. that said, i've managed to piece together enough to work with to get things done. i'd love to see a breakdown of the more complicated stats in the equipment screen, as these are often quite confusing to me, and i assume many others, who are not well versed in the soulborne universe. great video, cheers!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"man, i love the open world boss fights, especially agheel and tree sentinel. makes me wish there was something like the bonfire aeseticssp? from ds2 where you could respawn the boss of an area for more of a challenge and more souls. i would love to spend just hours fighting bosses from torrent's back."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,this is fantastic help for people like me who are brand new to this series. his beautiful voice makes him so pleasant to listen to!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i don't know what that subterranean deer's story was, but i'm guessing i need to prepare to cry"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i love what they did to guarding, though the traditional parrying is still really badass. i like how they have another alternative to parrying with shields. block retaliation is weaker then parrying but much easier and, if done with precision can be extremely effective"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i love how theres valuable information for both dark souls vets and people that are new to the series. very well made and written video, vaati. i expect nothing less, but still feel that i should acknowledge."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,"one thing i see rarely get attention is rainbow stones. tossing one off a ledge will let you know if it's safe to drop. if it explodes, you won't survive. if you see a colorful rock, then you will. it's also really good to use when you're exploring around to let you know where you've been. even i, a veteran of the soulsborn games, sometimes got lost while playing by running through previously explored areas. dropping a stone at junctions or forks in the road, or in branching cave systems, is always a good idea."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,amazing video. the value has only gone up over the last few days. i explored without checking guides and the early discoveries and struggles make a lot more sense now. thank you vaati
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"total monster of a game. the thought, planning and execution that has gone into it is awesome. no one's mentioned the sound, some fine ominous music that needs a good system to get the benefit. is 730 am too early to start?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-16,"i just bought this and spiderman 2 today. i am saving elden ring for my upcoming dad holiday. my kids and mrs are going to london to see family. so i get some me time trying this for the first time. it looks great. update. so i tried two classes and made builds that i tried last night and tonight. i tried confessor first and it was good and i will go back to that character. tonight i made a female astrologer. i am loving the world, art style and gameplay as a mage. i never usually use that class but it's brilliant here. i had my ass handed to me several times by the golden knight guy on horseback, and then i ventured off and found some cool stuff. what a game. thanks to this channel and this video i got some great starter tips. i will watch more and have subbed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"this is easily the best guide i've ever watched for elden ring, possibly the best guide i've ever watched full stop."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,my first souls game and im having a great time failing repeatedly. i did so much grinding at gatefront ruins i know all the guards on a first name basis. surprised myself by being able to beat the beastman in the cave and one of the giants. early days though.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this is the best beginners guide ive ever seen! incredibly straightforward and complete! this is perfect for the newcomers! any other veterans out there having difficulty getting used to mounted combat? well get there lol. if i can get the hang of sekiros parrying i can figure out torrent!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"hey vaat. ive been a long time subscriber and discovered your channel when you were doing all the lore behind dark souls iii. i use to lay in my hospital bed and listen to your videos as i tried to fall asleep. during those days i was struggling very heavily with my health and being in that room felt like a never ending eternity. now that elden ring is out, ive come back to the channel to get some insight and im happy to see how much youve grown and the content has stayed in its amazing quality. being back here is nostalgic for me, and although the memories are rough, im thankful to be alive. thanks for everything and those nights you gave me other things to think about other than my diagnosis. im happy youre still making content. i hope you continue to grow. an old fan"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"i cant ever imagine playing a souls game without watching your videos about it, vaati the souls scholar. thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,this is incredibly helpful even for a experienced souls veteran.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"im so excited to get this game, ive been waiting ever since the very first few whispers of the games announcement. plus vaati has always kept me loving the souls series and almost anything from soft makes. lots of importance in these games for me, thanks to the community and to vaati himself for making core memories and future nostalgia for me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"half the tips in this video had me saying to myself oh i had no idea, this was so helpful and i'll most likely beat a bunch more bosses thanks to this guide."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-22,seriously best guide so far. and i've played souls games before. this is great and actually goes into a lot of depth. especially with the nice combat advice.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,wow. i am lost for words with the amount of care and useful details put into this video. thank you so much for this
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,thank you for this video. entering elden rings as a souls novice is really tough. i didnt know grace was pointing in the direction of the main storyline. that helps alot
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,this is an excellently produced and informative guide. ive watched 3 times already to try and fully absorb all the content. great work!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"thanks for the vid vaati. you're surely one of the greats when it comes to souls content, and undeniably the handsdown goat for all of its lore. love your videos man, keep 'em coming."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-15,"just started playing today. the advice really did help me a lot! also my own advice to players, especially new ones. death is part of the journey, don't get upset over death. plus, it's a video game, you ever get really upset, take a breather for a little bit! amazing content vattividya!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-02,"thank you! i just started playing and this is exactly what i needed, exploration has been fun so far but combat is rough. all the guides i've found until now have been like, go here, pick this up, go there, fight that guy, spare the other guy, buy the item that makes the boss weaker. that's dumb. people want help to understand how to play the game, not ways to cheat it so they can play less of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i don't think many soulsborne streamers will take the time to cover what most gud players eroniously consider obsolete content. the fact that i learned several significant gameplay differences, even something simple as how to twohand, will definitely make my playthrough much more enjoyable. thank you vaati!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"this is by far the most helpful and comprehensive beginners video ive seen for a souls like game. ive tried a couple but it was never my thing, and recently got into elden ring and was a bit overwhelmed by everything with little to no guidance or direction ingame. this guide made everything far less daunting as it answered all of my questions and in a way that was simple enough to understand without dragging on. thanks vaatividya!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-14,"great video, straight to the point, no bs, just what i needed. mandatory for everybody playing elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-07,i'm 70 hours in and actually got some great tips from this! didn't know about holding down on the dpad or l1 and l2 attacks on the horse! thanks vaati
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,"i actually learned some good tips from this, even being over 20 hours into the game. great guide!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-28,it's amazing how the contents that's being shown and said are a 100 match for a video of this length. the effort that went into this video is astonishing.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"a couple of additional tips i don't see often mentioned spoiler free look for statues on cliffs edgeswalls, they have long necks, hunched posture and are pointing, they always point to something secret, look that way. a little into the game you will be able to alter your characters appearance entirely, so don't worry too much about perfecting your look in character creation, it can be changed freely. whilst optional, i recommend you explore all of limgrave before taking on the castle, the content seems balanced with this in mind, and you may find useful items that will help."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,i died legit about 30 to 40 times before i beat margit such a cool fight though and the music is incredible i really appreciate the run up to the boss literally being right outside the door too it just makes you more likely to keep giving him a go he's tough but man when you beat him its just as exhilarating as it always is beating a tough souls boss. forgot to add great video vaati
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"a helpful tip i found is when sneaking up on an enemy, instead of backstabbing, charge an r2 it might stagger them so you get a hit and a backstab, if not, it usually stuns them enough for you to get another r2 to finalize the stagger"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-18,seriously the best video on elden ring. im new to the game trying to be less frustrated with not understanding the game and this video helped me understand way more than 7 other videos combined!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"the pouch is one of the best additions. a tip if you're a heavy magic user, or use a lot of fp, is to put your cerulean flask on one of the pouch quick buttons. i have mine on triangledpad right. lets me have quick access to both flasks and saves messing about tapping down on the dpad to switch between them during battle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"what a well done video, this is perfect for beginners"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"24 hours in, and thanks to this video, i found out that i'd never understood how the summon mechanic worked. definitely going to make use of this now."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,amazing guide i clicked yours because you have subtitles but you speak so clearly that i didn't even end up needing them in the end! also appreciate that you show the buttons for both controllers. good stuff!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-12,"extremely helpful, no spoilers, gave me a ton of advice i deeply recomend you watch if your getting into elden ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-03,thank you so much! i'm a noob to these titles and was baffled that there aren't in game tutorials. i've been running around slaying sheep while i try to figure it all out!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,what a great guide! thank you for your time and dedication.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,his voice is so calming bro.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"a big thing i've noticed about elden ring vs other souls games is the number of options you have to get past an obstacle. reaching a tough boss might not simply require farming to get stronger, it might require using things like different ashes of war that exploit the boss's weakness or using a particular spirit summon. i'm starting to wonder if margit was so difficult because he was there to break the r1 dodge only habit that a lot of souls players have and encourage people to use some of the new mechanics. a particular spirit summon made him a lot more manageable, and on my next playthrough i'll probably try to solo him, but it was cool to have an option other than npcplayer summons to beat a boss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"i am completely new to fromsoftware games and felt overwhelmed by elden ring, even though it looks amazing and i really want to progress through it. this video cleared up so much for me and now i feel i am much more prepared to take on these crazy challenges. thank you so much!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-15,"after watching 5 guide videos and still feeling lost, i finally found the right one. my man, you are appreciated beyond belief lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"this game looks amazing. i struggle with souls games and pretty much have stayed away from them but this one, although still difficult, gives the player more options and ways to succeed which makes it very tempting to try my hand at this game. also, with the help of this guide, it will be a bit easier to navigate the map. thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"sometimes we forget there are people that never played a souls game. great job, as usual."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,today i finally deafeted my first boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-12,"i liked that you're explaining the most important basics instead of giving handholding tips. really enjoyed this one, thanks a lot!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,very small tip for veterans i found changing jump to y and a back to interact feels a lot more fluid and my muscle memory from the other games likes it more nothing serious but something to throw out there
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-19,this game is fun to play at night its hard as hell tho but its cool
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"from the sounds of it, super armour is basically a stressstagger meter. which should be familiar to anyone who's played god of war 2018."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"first of, big thank you! most of the guides i've watched are the you should do this, go there first, look out for this etc. etc. type of guides yours gave me a great insight into the controls and mechanics of the game. i was struggling big time trying to figure out what does what exactly, and your explanation helped greatly! i'm brand new to a soul's game and this video plays a crucial part in learning it. your voice is also incredibly amazing to listen to. you earned a subscriber, mainly for the informational video, and secondly for that sweet soothing voice  keep up the good work!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"man as far as the first mandatory boss goes, margit definitely gave me the toughest time out of the whole soulsborne series."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,chase does the willy wave and everybody loves it. i do the willy wave and i end up on a list.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"blasphemous billy, bloodhound bob, and wave of gold william. the pillar men of elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"given chase's happy disposition, one might say that his strategy for this video was smile and wave."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i don't think you've given him a name, but there's the guy who wears the white mask and raptor feathers, spamming jump attacks with two blood peelers. i run into him all the time. peeler pete?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,willy wave... i think that gets you in trouble lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"ah yes, wave of gold william, blasphemous billy's slow cousin"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,029 you want to make sure you have a decent amount of mind such an oxymoron statement with this build
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"the bushes are dishonest, dishonest as it gets chase 2025"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"the police have politely asked willy to stop waving it, or else he's going to jail."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"chase is definitely a skinwalker, he steals newbie bodies after invasions just to hide in them"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,billy is short for william... wait.... are they just the same person? oh no..
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,as an occasional cooperator and frequent invader i feel like i would 100 underestimate someone doing this cosplay and end up getting destroyed
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"now every time i fight radahn, i keep relating him to the final boss version of kevin"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,theres no way chase really did wave of gold william before my glorious goat rob kevin. and i'm sure he's forgotten that doing a melina cosplay is even in the picture
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"the tactical and martial prowess of chase, a champion among invaders, all behind a meme build that the skilless use for easy kills. this may be a faith build, but for chase's victims, there is no god!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"chase has just collected another dishonesty stone for the gauntlet, i think he's almost done he's collected billy, spam wizard, bob, i don't remember if there's a full rivers of blood build but there probably is, now william of gold."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"where's the wave of gold , william ?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"alternatively known as waverly will. but you know what isn't wavey, and is instead unwavering? nanaya's torch. endure, chase, endure."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i love when chase uses the willy wave, he hits the opponents almost every time. but when i do it, opponents dodge it effortlessly every time and i question why i even bother to use the thing on my faith build aside from farming lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,the bushes are dishonest.  chase 2025
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"so many willy actions willy wave, willy smack, willy poke."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i loved the timing of did you even notice me? wizard came up like but did you notice me?!l
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,prepare for constant wave of gold action
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i used to call them golden wave dave. but screaming willy wave! is so much better.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,frenzied flame nanaya has invaded your world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"wizard gone, carry on"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"willy wave! is now my new favorite expression.  randomly, since chase doesn't seem to want to, i'm currently doing nanaya's torch invasions until he hopefully changes his mind."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,you mean gold wave willy? he went that'a way...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,this is the first time someone with skill has used this armour set
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i can't really see you...ah, the bushes are dishonest! they're as dishonest as it gets! new favorite ctb quote"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,440 i love doing the willy smack when im sword fighting
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,it's amazing that chase can smack so many people with his willywave and just get away with it...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,that evil cackling at 150 was insane and i love it lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"willy smacks, willy swings, willy waves, and then willy has to register and inform his neighbors whenever he moves to a new neighborhood"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,must yell free willy when pushing l2
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"when elden ring becomes a battle between bob, randy, willy and sometimes a filthy wizard."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,seeing chase dominate these invasions with this weapon really puts into perspective how good he must be to deal with them used against him.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"this is like this generation's full fallen knightshield of wantirithyll straightsword cosplay, and i'm here for it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,last time i showed someone my willy wave they banned me from the library
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,in half of these invasions the host is accidentally killed by collateral willy waves.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,what was it that harvey dent said about living long enough to become the villain?
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,missed a perfect opportunity to have a blasphemous billy face off against a wave of gold willy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,chase cackling with evil glee is what i'm here for.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,it's time for rivers of blood and moonveil to join the family of kevins.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,william and billy are two sides of the same coin
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"chase, if you combined william the gold, bobby the hound, billy the blasphemous. you become larry the ligma."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,willy smack!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"yo chase i just wanna say i cant believe your dedication and love for elden ring. theres months of content i watch when sleeping, and im thankful for you. you the man"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,144 exact moment when a william descends into madness
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"funnily enough, this reminds me of a recent influx of players using a certain torch and radahn armor... ever heard of nanaya ned?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i was gonna comment bucky but you did it yourself lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"while i do miss eating dinner with you chase, i do enjoy being able to be this early to videos and use your videos to unwind before bed."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,sometimes i duel with this setup and act like a true willi wave and hard swap to golden crux and get a sneaky crit they never expect
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,508 sorry chase but as a wave of gold addict you totally deserved that
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"loving the kevin season, nice l2 cosplays!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,did he really say willy wave
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"personally, should have been golden gillian. and the gilly wave. ok willy wave works too, and it is even funnier as billy and willy are nicknames of the same name."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"you rarely use dual wield setups, so it might be a nice variation. the nox flowing hammer is also a very fun weapon that has been forgotten for quite a while."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,chasethewilly?  the chase memes are infinite.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,many people have used this build before kai. this is the typical build that streamers use when they havent played a souls game. their chat makes it for them.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"funny how when i was a new player in elden ring i didnt even know this was the average bleed build and just used it because i like nagakiba, and liked rivers of blood."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-12,"i used the bloodhound sword together with a ice curved greatsword the one dropped by omens, with ice ash of war and just perma staggered her to death stats 70 str 30dex"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,"nagakiba by itself is already really strong, you don't need rivers of blood. cold infused nagakiba with double slash. high int and dex, shard of alexander, lord of bloods exultation, rotten winged sword and whatever defensive talismen of your choice. light roll. i can absolutely shred melania with this build. if you want you can throw in a carian regal scepter on the offhand with night comet if you want to chip away at her health from range."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-01,someone should have shown him star fists
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-18,im pretty shure kai didnt use mimics. i had a similar build and used a mimic and it was easy because you do a crazy amount of damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,bro used summons when kai cenat didnt.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,honestly props to kai for beating this game! i lost all faith after his tree sentinel like i thought hed give up once he got to lyndell lol! i dont really watch him but thats dedication for a non souls player lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,i dont think he used a summon gang
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,"this is literally the most overpowered build for any boss and once i tested it against messmer and vaporised him, and i'd also say messmer is harder than melania for me, so it's insane how long it took him with that build"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-12,that is just a copy of let me solo her with out the jar helmet and has freeze pots
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,"i use a 99 arcane build with seppuku on a 25 nagakiba. talismans are both consecutive attack talismans, lord of bloods exultation, and the erdtree favor 2. physick opaline bubble tear and the one the gives you health near death. incantationbestial vitality. i beat the base game and dlc over 20 times with it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-11,"im sorry but isnt this lmshs original, iconic build. we shouldnt attribute it completely to kc"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,i first beat her with nagakiba but now everytime i fight her i just use lions claws great sword with stance break tear and it literally melts her everytime  she cant even do waterfowl because i end her first phase too fast its actually insane how broken lions claw can become
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,i just used two heavy great stars that really got me through malenia's fight. i died once but got her on the 2nd attempt. that's not bad.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,i too love to brouse for that type of footage
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,"i dont really enjoy kais content, but after seeing the mans insane level of persistence and genuine appreciation for the game, he definitely has my respect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,blastimus blade  nimik tear  feier skorpion
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-30,i just used blasphemous blade and spammed the ash of war
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,"bro i just beat it 5th try 10 minutes ago, how did he take hundreds"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-14,the thing is he has people in chat whove played tf outta this game so they tell him where importantrare things are  somethings we dont know cause we figure it out ourselves thats why i wanna get his full full even fails twitch stream  play through it cause i wanna get some stuff that chats telling him to get
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-10,bruh the first armor pick with the twin head is like my exact build right now tf
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-26,kai cenat didn't use mimic
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,i first time beat malenia trying 12 times using bloodhound fang in ng 1 i beat her 3rd try using magma blades both hand in ng 2 i beat her 1st time using blasphemous blade nafty oil pot

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,i used a co op summon and the heaviest armour i had to beat her
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"when your build is not yours, but of your fans, anyway still gg for kai that didn' t gave up"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,bro thats let me solo hers build
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,i used nagakiba and rivers of blood to beat the game on my first run
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,any build with nagakiba
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-16,i was so scared to fight malenia so i never did for two years and i finnaly did after beating shadow of the erd tree and i first tried her
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-07,"kai used lmsh strategy to beat her, he wasnt using that set up the entire stream"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-16,i feel like kai had good mentality and builds its js the skill that made it a long run if he wouldve gotten more practice he wouldve beat it way faster
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,let me solo her
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-18,lol my build stun locks her on my first play through i made a random aahh build and this the things i used get 10 max upgraded mimic tear maliketh helmet draconic tree sentinel chestplate draconic tree sentinel leggs and shoes bloodhound fang max  bloodflame incantation golden vow incantation flame grant me strength  green turtle talisman blessed dew talisman giant pot arsenal talisman or whatever it's called and shard of alexander and let your mimic take agro and do the f skill and then spam heavy attack for the finnese think and melenia will be stunned locked most of the time it's stance break and for phase two just dodge the first attack and do the same thing with your mimic and help the mimic as much as u can before it dies before phase two
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,kai's build was solid but only thing missing is skill
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,isnt that the let me solo her build?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,i used blasphemous blade and just spammed the takers flame while the mimic just tanked malenia

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-18,kai just watched a tuto
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-25,"its not kais build though, his mod sunny told him where everything was, just your average rob build"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,aa yes the naked kiba
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,he didnt use summons tho
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,where do you find these weapons
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,i beat malenia on my second try using the rivers of blood. nothing special just river my armor and decent accesories.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,he didn't use a summon tho
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-18,mohgs spear 55 times i always beat her try it thank me later
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,you used mimic
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"the build i used to when facing malenia the first time was quite broken 1 talismans 1.1 rotten winged sword insignia i did not have millicent's prosthesis cuz i wasn't a monster yet 1.2 lord of blood's exaltation obviously 1.3 shard of alexander i never take it off, so that my friend, alexander the great, will be eternally at my side 1.4 winged sword insignia cause why not armor 1 varre's headset white mask 2 radahn's leggings and gloves buffs 1 golden vow 2 flame grant me strength flask of wondrous physics 1 opaline bubbletear 2 thorny cracked tear weapon 1 rivers of blood main hand 2 blasphemous blade offhand i also used a 10 mimic tear."

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,for all you new players to the souls series if an armorless character is running at you... they're stronger than you and you need to leave asap.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,gotta give props to any company nowadays that stick to their creative vision and dont try to appeal to everyone for profit. lot of respect for miyazaki and the team.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"don't worry, i'm sure after they patch it for a year and... wait... it's a complete, finished game upon release? whoa. that alone deserves a 10."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,genius. being able to ditch a frustrating boss and go elsewhere is just pure genius for a fromsoftware game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,this reviewer actually seems authentic. have him review more games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"if you're avoiding minor spoilers, they gave it a 1010."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"the effort and care the devs seem to have put into this game is outstanding. in an age of games that are released buggy, broken and unfinished, from software deserve a thank you for making such a masterpiece. lots of replies saying horizon zero west is better. can't we just agree with horizon zero west and elden ring releasing this month, that it is a great time to be a gamer?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,lots of respect for from software for staying true to their vision. from a niche title to a wildly popular franchise that has influenced many other games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"the only thing that had me worried about the game was whether theyd be able to make the open world feel varied and interesting where it seems so many open world games fail to do this. im super glad to hear they knocked it out of the park in that respect. never doubt from, they are masters of their craft."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,this is the magnum opus of hidetaka miyazaki and his team  this is the culmination of years of incredible work experience and what happens when a man and his team are at the absolute pinnacle of their craft.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"1010 exactly the right amount of elden, the perfect amount of ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-11,for all of you out there that still havent played this. dont miss out on this masterpiece! do yourself a favor and get it now you will not regret it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,again ign ... great of you that you got people who actually love games to do these reviews. cheers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,the quality of ign's reviewers has improved lately
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,not my type of game or art style but man is it refreshing to see an open world that does not sell out their vision for mass appeal.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"owning this game is like a chest full of treasures. truly an unforgettable experience in an rpg genre. a priceless treasure like demon souls, dark souls series and bloodborne... two thumbs up from software. another magnificent game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,fromsoft gonna get another goty award and they absolutely deserve it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"dang, remember 8 months ago we didn't think it would ever gonna be released? now here it is, getting a perfect score"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"fromsoft just proving yet again that they are the torchbearers of the gaming industry's old spirit total dedication to their craft, releasing a complete game upon launch, and constantly trying to innovate without sacrificing their soul. they remind us of what gaming once was, and what it could be once again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,this game will go down in history as one of the great gaming masterpieces. elden ring just keeps getting better and better the further you get into the game. take your time and enjoy this magnificent world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"we all saw the great reviews coming, but its something else to actually see this game getting outstanding reviews!! can't wait to play!! well done once again fromsoft"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,this reviewer is literally one of the best that ign has.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,so great to finally have a game that looks complete at launch. other studios need to take note.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,i'm so hooked on this game. the magic and incantations along with spirit summons make for awesome boss battles. never played any dark souls or bloodbourne but it's got me wanting to now.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"the way of completing side quests in from soft games is different to any other game. they arent there for you to successfully complete them. what you do will affect the npcs is different ways, some might be positive, usually negative. the negative is just as important to convey the experience of the world as the positive is. and just like the real world you might continue on your own path and forget about a task you wanted to,do to help them"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,never completed a souls game but tempted to buy this just to support the devs and it being open world interests me more. so strange seeing a game come out fully ready for release
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,spell casting looks sooooo much smoother than it does in the souls games. very excited for this game even without the 10 rating
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-13,"this game is a true masterpiece. this game has everything unique bosses, great weapons, massive areas to explore, secret hidden pathways, a weapon what's a literal finger, warp portals two different regions across the map. hell you can just walk around and find something in the world. game of the got damn year."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"how crazy is it that this game is only 50 brand new on the ps store, being a fully completed absolute gem of a game, and then you have other games at 70 that are a lazy unfinished piece of crap on release. the one game that is actually worth the month is cheaper than the rest"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"i've never played any souls game before, looks like this will be my first all the reviews got me really excited"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"not having micro transactionsloot boxes is always, always a win"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-12,"coming back half a year later, elden ring really is a 1010 masterpiece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,finally!!! a game that was hyped up to the absolute max and still exceeds expectations rather than let us down! cant freaking wait
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,great job fromsoftware. we're all proud of you and you show all the other devs that there are zero excuses.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,miyazaki is the greatest game director of all time
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"no day one dlc, no microtransactions or battlepass of any kind. except for some bugs and performance issues elden ring is a complete package, this style of game isn't for everyone, but for me it's an absolute must buy and i'll probably be playing it for years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,about damn time from software never disappoints!!! miazaki san does it again!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,imagine how ecstatic fromsoftware would be after hearing this news! i'm super excited for these guys and even more excited to play their game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"this seems like a game that's unapologetically itself. the devs didn't compromise the quality of design and polish in all areas to pander to a market or fulfill a trend. games like cuphead, bioshock 1, shovel knight, mother, are what come to mind that wreak of the passion from their dev teams. and i'm definetly feeling that energy here. i'm by no means a souls fans, but this victory got me excited for the future of gaming as an art form alone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,the art direction here is truly unmatched!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,some games you can just tell the developers put their heart and soul into it trying to make a timeless masterpiece for the ages. crazy how from the first gameplay trailer last year you tell it was one of those games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"great review. very well done. as a relative newcomer to fromsoft games having only played a few hours of sekiro, this review gets me so hyped for elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,just the fact that this is a true open world style has my attention. and the creator of got has his influence in the game is awesome. this is my first from game i'm excited to get my a handed to me
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,game should be 600 based on the amount of content it has. what a value. some sections can be self contained games by themselves. definitely one of the best games ever created!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,ive never seen so many reviewers give a 1010 like elden rings has done. this game is going to be amazing.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,hidetaka miyazaki is a fing genius and we need more of his kind in the gaming world. full stop.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,if only more developers would strive for this level of artistry. absolutely stunning.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,truly deserving of the goty award!!! one of the most unique gaming experiences i've ever had in a long long while!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,fromsoft on a streak rn consistently putting out these bangers
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,anyone who's curious and doesn't wanna watch it they gave it a 10
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,fromsoftwarre out here showing everyone how to make a game once again.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-16,"the souls formula is the perfect formula for gamers that seek adventure and challenge, just about each souls like title wins game of the year or is the most well received by critics and audiences."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"no loot boxes, no suprise gambling mechanics, no nfts. 1010"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"my favorite thing about from software games is that you can come back to them after years and still be blow away by how beautiful and interesting they are. you don't buy a souls game, play it, beat it and toss it. it's like buying something with real value."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"i'm about 80 hours in now. amazing game. trying to complete everything available. love super difficult games, and this is up there. prefer this to dark souls."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,this game is a true rpg through and through. you can do basically anything you want and beat bosses in many different ways. the freedom you have in this game is close to nothing else we've seen. not to mention the lore and story behind the elden ring world. this game is definitely one of the best games us gamers have been given in a long time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-26,my jaw just drops to the floor while playing through this game. the environments and vastness of this game is beyond impressive and incredible. easily in my top 5 best games i've ever played. from software developers deserve so much praise and recognition.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-08,elden ring is game of the year and set so many standards for all games out there
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-31,"20 million copies sold, game of the year, multiple other awards and absolutly 0 micro transaction. thats how yo win players respect and awards."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,so glad mitch got to review this one. been watching his stuff since the old expert walkthroughs a decade ago. cant wait to jump into this game!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-10,"this is what you called a true game. the difficulty, the epic boss fights, the open world, the exploration, the rpg mechanics, item huntings, mini boss fights. it deserved the game of the year award. perfect game it captures the open world of skyrim and zelda botw but the uniqueness of this game is the epic boss fights and the difficulty of the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"it looks like the game lived up to the huge hype, definitely i'll be getting this one. and as someone mentioned, is great to see a game released in complete manner, not filled with bugs and depending on a day one patch. kudos for from software."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"finally beat this game! it's absolutely a masterpiece. just magnificent. anyone who's on the fence about getting it, trust me, do it, you won't regret it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"for all the elden ringsouls newcomers, patience is key. this is not a game to go flailing the attack button. start steady, learn their attack pattern, should you stay or run. when in doubt, get the hell out"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,give this man a raise. the guy knows his stuff! can't wait to get my hands on this. been waiting since 2019.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-15,"this is one of the greatest games i've ever played. if you're thinking about getting it, go buy it now you won't regret it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,the developers who never fail to deliver
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,might be one of the best review from ign up to date. elden ring is amazing im 23 hours in and loving it. this review really is well thought out and explained as to why its amazing. the exploration really feels like no other game i've played. 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-13,"there are games made with half the amount of content here, more technical issues, charged for 70 and even have the audacity to try  prey money out of you further with mts. this is a great reminder for what games should be like"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,im so ready for this game. fromsoftware and miyazaki never disappoint
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"masterpiece, not even surprised. this won't only be game of the year, it'll be game of the decade. fromsoftware simply do not make average games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,10 masterpiece for those who don't want spoilers. see you in the lands between
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,i've said this before and i'll say it again all the from software games are just adult versions of zelda. it's what zelda should have been since they showed that trailer way back in the day. and especially now that elden ring has an overworld and a horse to ride. it's literally the zelda that everybody's always wanted. nintendo you're never gonna beat this. you should have did this years ago. thank you from software for making an adult version of zelda that's what we wanted.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"crazy to think a couple of years ago we were just imagining what this game would look like. now we're insanely close to getting out hands on it, and seeing all these glowing reviews makes me so happy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,love how from is expanding the soulsbloodborne mechanics little by little.it's a game i'll never propably buy but enjoy immensely watching others play.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,miyazaki never disappoints.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-11,when 1010 is actually a 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,damn breath of the wild was the dark souls of legend of zelda games and elden ring is the breath of the wild of dark souls games
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,always loved the ai that charges and punishes when your going for the health chug 953...perfect rage fuel.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"the best way to explain this game is that even if you don't complete all areas or beat the already discovered 151 bosses listed on wiki so there's probably even more, it's beautiful in the sense that there's literally so much to do and so many places to go. so almost every player will still have their own experiences and probably have enough to be satisfied. even if you only fight 80 bosses, that's still 80 bosses! this game is the best open world rpg any true fan of those genres could ask for."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,just for everyone the game is sitting on 96 for 72 reviewers. thats insane. edit now its 97 for 108 reviewers. what is happening? the hype is real!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,thank you fromsoftware for showing people how to make an open world game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,the open world aspect is great. having to play the same levels to increase stats was tedious
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-26,"this was a well deserved 1010 rating. elden ring is an absolute masterpiece, and a masterclass on how to make a video game. it's one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"so glad it's mitch doing the review, been watching him play souls games since the gamefront days! definitely respect his opinion!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,media site saying elden ring will take at least 50 hours to 70 hours to beat laughs in exploration
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,seems like it's the only aaa multiplatform game that totally meets and goes beyond the hype! insane. no microtransactions or anything... congratulations from software... incredible.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"fromsoft deserves the success they have had. this is a complete experience, with excellent mechanics, open world, and so much pvp and lore to last for years. game of the year for sure!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,literally the only game ive ever preordered and so far im not regretting it one bit
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"wow, i'm not a gamer, but after this review, even i'm ready to buy a system and start playing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,these games like this and botw are incredibly rare. they push the genre further and are a whole experience. can't wait to play this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"witcher 3 shows what a rpgs can be with beautiful vistas,deep develop characters,and huge deep lore,elden ring show us that level designs,art direction and precise controls can be amazing as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"watching the intro to this review honestly got me emotional. after sinking many of hundreds of hours into every game in the souls series and waiting years for elden ring to finally come out, hearing an ign reviewer describe the emotions he felt playing this, and knowing it will be a high praise review makes me feel like my souls experience has finally come full circle and all the hype we all had for years was actually not in vain and we have reached now the pinnacle of our video game journeys. the wait is finally over. rise tarnished"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-13,elden ring is one of the greatest video games ever made.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,this is one of the most stunning worlds ive ever seen in a game. great art design
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"142 hours and im still finding new things in the game, for real its like it never ends"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"this is the first time since the witcher 3 was released that i've enjoyed playing an open world game, great job fromsoft"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,really the best game ive played in 2022 and hope it gets its much earned goty award
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,been a fan of fromsoft since dark souls prepare to die edition in 2012. theyve come so far im so proud of them
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"dude knows how to do a review. well written, well done"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,shoutout to trey and vincent for editing these beast videos!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"its one thing to upload an almost 12 hour video, but edited? jack was right. huge shoutout to his editors trey and vincent"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"this is what im here for, sean playing exactly what he wants whenever he wants. makes me so happy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-03,"this took me over 2 weeks to watch and it was worth it thank you so much jack for all the great years and entertainment youve gave to millions you are amazing, ive been watching you since i was a little kid and that is no longer the case you have been a beacon of joy for everyone who has followed you over the years"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,ive watched this countless times i love it. it has become my favorite and comfort video. i play it when im overstimulated or on the brink of panic or cant sleep or just to watch. thank you for playing and posting games you love
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,"expectation elden ring appreciation and a new build i could try reality jack discovering his bill burr impression, talks about mental health and youtube life, jack putting bosses in the fcking ground"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"sean instantly referencing ryshadium horses when he sees the tree sentinel makes me so happy, i love that he has gotten into the storm light archives"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,i use your playthroughs as ambient noise during my workdays and they keep me so productive and im so grateful for these sagas to keep my career afloat
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,"i like how blaidd just reached behind bonk's ear like, is this you smithing stone?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"sean being able to play what he wants and his fanbase actually following and supporting him, slightly restores my faith in humanity."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"i want to confirm for you sean if you had any doubts, you talking about your mental health is so relatable to me and i greatly appreciate it. i'm also living for these fromsoft videos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,thats.. a lot of hours..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-24,"i used to watch your video in the past and then took a bit of a break. came back to see whats up. all ya videos are so long now, thats insane. so happy to see how far you have come man, you really helped me grow"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"im sure someones commented this already, but the mohg you fight in the sewers isnt the real mohg. hes an omen projection, presumably cast by morgott to prevent anyone from reaching the three fingers. when you defeat this version of mohg, he dissolves into golden dust, which is exactly what happens to the projections of morgott you fight when hes masquerading as margitt. if i remember correctly, if you go into the sewers before beating morgott, theres also a barrier that prevents you from going further and says sealed by morgott the grace given or something along those lines, which also appears at the altus divine towers too. so i think morgott just placed the projection of his brother down there as a last ditch effort to prevent someone from inheriting the flame of frenzy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-19,"you know its a good video when you look at the time and think aw, only 4 more hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"theres no point down emote he says as he scrolls right next to the point down emote  love you jack, thanks for making another elden ring vid."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,"i have always wanted to play a souls game, but could never seem to get the hang of it before. i tried playing the first game dark souls, and i never even managed to get past the first boss outside of the tutorial. then i started watching your playthroughs of the games, and i became especially captivated with elden ring. my partners informed me i couldn't try it till i beat a dark souls game, so i thought i'd never get to play it. but thanks to your dark souls video, i finally got the hang of it. i followed along, and built my own bonk. thanks to you, i've beaten a dark souls game for the first time, and i'm planning to get elden ring soon. thank you so much for making these videos and showing how to really get into these games. it really helped me a lot. i have been hollow, and now i shall be tarnished."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,4307 you should read how the irish saved civilization by thomas cahill. it's a great indepth look into how irish monks are basically the only reason we have written records about the predark age era
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"if anyone was curious, drawing room is actually is a shortened form for withdrawing room, as you withdraw to it after your meal or whatever"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-25,"as someone who played elden ring for so many hours, and died hundreds of times, it is so satifying to see sean come in and comepletely wipe out hordes of enemies, and clear bosses first try!! there is something so theraputic about it for me, and i am so here for it! all hail the mighty bonk!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,beyonc subtlety playing when he puts the ring on rannis finger killed me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,"honestly... i usually have youtube videos in the background at all times of my life. this. is. perfect. it's great to chill with, clean with, sleep with, do homework with its great. plus, it fulfills my need to play this game, but i'm scared to because i suck at games. perhaps this will give me courage."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,i love the fact it's now confirmed that bonk has something akin to alopecia. bonk is so strong that not even hair can hold him back from being as aerodynamic as possible
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,113937 that was you. the audience was double bonk. you got the final hit.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,"sean to answer your question about hiring an orchestra and the royal albert hall in london it would be in the 6 figures. 125,000 and the majority of that is just the orchestra with it being 100 grand for a top end one and the 25k is the book the hall for 1 day. absolutely mental."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"it would cost approximately 50,000 to hire an orchestra and hire out the royal albert hall, and with the 5272 capacity of the royal albert hall it would be a possible without tickets having to be sold for a ridiculous amount"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,sean once said in a farcry video long ago because thats what this is about having fun.  glad to see him enjoying it again
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"all hail, return of bonk, the continuation saga. gotta take an extra day off to watch this season."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,"late reply because i use your video at the moment to help me guide through my own elden ring playthrough, but hearing jack talk about depression and his feelings made me feel like im not the only one. i looked up to jack when he first started youtube and he helped me through my own depression and knowing hes going through it as well made me feel sad but it made me more relieved to know im not the only one, but jack we love you and you will get through this depression stay strong"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-21,"my family and i watched the entire bonk series and now my daughter who is only a year old keeps going around saying me bonk, me kill"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,22325 jack talks about cells markiplier have you heard of the ship of theseus?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-21,"41926 sean we all love you. i can personally say that i have watched you for many years, and the fact that you still upload gaming videos fairly often fills me with so much joy and is so comforting to me. every time you start a new series i get super excited."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,super refreshing to see this form of long format style of videos again
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-22,"i like how jack was saying that he wants his videos to be enjoyed longer than an afternoon. well ive been watching bits of this video every afternoon after work and im only halfway, i look forward to it everytime"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-20,"23000 skyrim lore! the stars pretty much are magic in the elder scrolls universe. the aurbis is basically a 3layered sphere, with mundus being the inner layer, aetherius being the outer layer and oblivion being the middle layer. mundus, nirn and the mortals that inhabit it were created when lorkhan tricked the etada gods, essentially to give up some of their essence. this split the etada into three factions the aedra meaning our ancestors, the gods that stayed to create mundus, the daedra meaning not our ancestors, the gods that outright refused from the beginning and the magnage meaning children of magnus or followers of magnus or something. the magnage initially went along with lorkhan, but once magnus discovered lorkhan's trickery, he and a bunch of other etada decided to dip before the mundus was fully formed, and so they tore holes through oblivion to escape back to aetherius. so when you look up at the sky at nighttime in an elder scrolls game, you're basically looking at oblivion, and the stars are the holes left in it that the magnage used to flee. the sun is just the biggest of the holes that was torn by magnus himself. the holes left to aetherius are what allow magicka to flow in from aetherius to mundus, which allows mortals to cast spells and such."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,looks at length of the video guess i'll order some takeout
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-19,there is something nostalgic about just a dude playing a video game and sharing the content. no unessecary editing no screaming just the game and commentary. thank you for providing this type of content in the year of 2024 where the algorithm has taken over and every video feels kinda the same. been here for a long time sadly responsibilities have taken over. it is all the more nice to just watch you play a game when i don't have the energy to do so and i can be transported back to the days where things were just a little easier!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-24,"i've been a subscriber for ten years and throughout all the controversy concerning other youtubers, you've always stayed wholesome and true to yourself. honestly, we love hearing you talk about your struggles because it makes it tangible for the rest of us who can't because it's too much. stay golden and keep doing what you're doing!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-04,made it halfway its been fun to watch you in your element truly enjoying yourself. thanks sean for always being authentic.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,i'm happy someone else pointed out the the godskin duo has one of the best boss tracks yet is the worst boss. they don't deserve that perfection
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-02,"i've always wanted to actually play all the way through elden ring, but i could never really figure out the best way to do it. thank you jack for showing us all especially all in one go. i truly do appreciate this. i tried a samurai build got to castle monroe and just kept dying, then i watch your video and you don't go straight there lol. i made a bonk build now though and i'm going to play through the game with this video playing as like a guide until i am comfortable just running around. this is also my first soulsfromsoft game that i have played. thank you once again for the amazing videos, will forever be one of my families favorite content creators. ps yes we would all indeed love watching you play through every single game all in one video. i thought it was really cool that you were thinking of making videos that ...last longer than one afternoon...."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"sean, your continuous use of the bonk has brought me immeasurable entertainment. i am currently creating a fantasy world, and have now created lore in honour of your milk drinking creation. thank you for brightening the world with your content. i wish nothing but the best for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,"23003 the stars are indeed magic in the elder scrolls. more specifically, theyre holes torn into the sky by magnus and the magna ge so that they could escape being bound to mundus, and those holes go straight to aetherius, which is the source of all light and magic in the setting"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-22,"41700 when sean talked about his own brain making things worse, or making problems up really hit home, other people may talk about it online but not everyone else is our streamer, means a lot more hearing it for him"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,the way i just rolled up and stole the great stars weapon from the back of the wagon and dipped without having to fight or take a single hit thanks to you.  i would not have known it opens wo beating all of the foes first. you just saved me two hours.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,"1250 theres no like, point down its right there next to the point up agehdgskdgjshskd"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"hi sean, i just wanted to comment and say that i put this on my laptop while falling asleep and when i woke up and switched it back on in the kitchen, you were talking about your anxiety and depression. i am a law student and have recently been spiraling into a really bad place. i can't claim to be one of your first viewers, an avid donator, or somebody who likes and watches all your videos. but it really fell close to my heart and made me feel less alone for withdrawing and feeling some of the things you feel. i love your content, i have followed along since i was about 14, and you have always made me smile or laugh, even if it is just a snort through my nose. thank you for being such a positive, fun and encouraging source for me and millions of others. keep doing what you love, and we will love it and you in this parasocial way as well lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-28,"welcome to death talley. yes...we really did it, we hope you like it. as per the usual rules, we will only count on screen deaths, with that out of the way lets talley. death talley 29 gravity 6 rats 1 slimes 1 invasions 1 carian sorcerers 2 red wolf of radagon 1 moongrim 1 fingercreepers 2 ekzykes 1 bloodhound knights 1 albunarics 1 iron virgins 1 rykard 1 ants 1 zamor knights 1 ulcerated tree spirit 1 lions 1 niall 1 banished knight 1 erdtree avatar 1 crystellians 1 elden beast 1 analysis from our analysis, it seams that sean's deaths were quite infrequent, and sporadichowever, one thing that is fairly consistent between death to death is when sean shows a glaring lack of situational awarness, or carelessness, it almost always results in him getting killed. this means most of his deaths are largely due to his own fault as he often beat most bosses with some exception on his first or second try."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-16,"jack you help me through so much in life, when im feeling down i just watch good ol jackaboy and feel better! thank you so much for everything you do. you do so much more than just play video games and will forever have a special place in my heart"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,this man is just pumping out literal movie series in single videos
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,"a few tips for anyone doing the same build as sean 1 for the first great stars, you dont need to fight anything! i drank my bubble physick just in case, raced to the carriage from the back on torrent  just hopped off onto it  looted it. you dont need to stop the giants or anything! 2 the second great stars from the invasion, its tied to a quest for white mask varre so if you find  talk to him before killing magnus the beast claw, you will get some additional rewards. 3 the knight armor set is one of the best early game sets as its the lightest heavy armor that gets you the poise threshold of 51. you can buy the whole set at the roundtable hold from twin maiden husks for 13500 runes. 4 in case you didnt know, by default, great stars actually slightly restores hp when landing attacks! enjoy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,12 hours of happiness listening to a majestic irish man playing one of the best games ever
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,this video is like a classic. it's so much content and you can just throw it on randomly at any point in the video and it's just entertaining and a good time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"2140 a general tip for ppl who want to play any of the fromsoft games including elden ring. if you hold the weapon with two hands, your strength gets multiplied by 1.5 just for weapon requirement so to hold this greataxe you would only need 20 strength."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-16,"ive been watching off and on for a few days now but i just wanted to say thank you for talking about how your mind, even when something is rational, overthinks every possible situation that could go wrong and how it really affects having fun. i don't get on rollercoasters or try a lot of new things because it's always like.. what if i embarrass myself or something goes extremely wrong this one time that i decide to try something new. but yes, thank you. i definitely feel less alone. i'm sorry to hear other people go through this and at the same time selfishly i'm glad there are people that understand."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"log 1 im 1 hour in and already i see this will take multiple sittings to finish. ive been through all the fromsoft full game videos but this is a whole different beast. i begin to doubt the fact that someone can talk for 12 hours straight, but it is jack were talking about. i dont intend to spoil the video but i will keep this log updated to track my own sanity. for scepticeye science."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,guess who's rewatching this
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"i really really love these long videos because it feels kinda just like hanging out with someone while they play and i've even caught myself responding a few times as i sit here and crochet, like i would have if i was hanging out with someone on a couch while they played games. these videos and a joy to watch because you really seem to be having a good time with them, and they just provide a day's worth of comfortable background noise. also, as someone who is absolutely dogshit terrible at soulsbloodborneelden ring, i love getting to see so much of these games without putting myself through frustration lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,oh my god jack ur timing is absolutely perfect!!! i have a script i need to finish and i will be playing this in the background!! thank you thank youu
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-21,"on the off chance this comment reaches you, sean, i wanted to say that your videos never fail to bring me comfort and joy. i have late diagnosed adhd, as well as the prerequisite anxiety  depression, and you've always felt like a kindred spirit. thank you for all your hard work over the years!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-05,"this was such a wonderful video!!! i actually didn't finish the first series because life stuff came up and i just totally forgot i didn't watch until the end. the legacy of bonk will be cherished. honestly though this was such a crazy cozy video of just having fun playing games. these are the best videos, thank you. yes i've seen these fights before and but this is a different play through. for me, i got to see a new ending! this video kept me great company for about a week and is definitely making me want to watch all the rest"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"gotta give respect for sean for uploading a full playthrough of 12 hours, without doing it in parts"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-29,"i see everyone saying, oh my god! jack dropped a whole ass 12 hour video. thats long! and im over here malding at the fact that this man beat the game in 12 hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-21,"dude, one of the rarest weapons in the game dropped for you around 32406 the celebrant's ribrake has a 0.05 drop rate at 100 discovery. not even the best of weapons but very rare!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-24,"tbh jack ik you said nobody really remembers your videos, but i guarantee you, at least from my standpoint your videos are incredibly memorable, like i still remember your prototype 2 lets play that you did a long time ago. your videos have stuck with me for years. i love you jack keep making great videos!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-28,"i was diagnosed adhd and autistic at 27. dealt with depression, imposter syndrome, rsd all my life. i just know what they are now. im 30 now. and im still learning more about myself and how i as a person work. and im so proud how open and honest sean is about his struggles. it takes guts griffith!!! to talk about it and be so candid with it. and you are right, knowing there are others out there going through the same, makes you not feel so alone. proud of you brosidon, lord of the brocean!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-13,"i know that you probably won't see this, but you're not alone by any means. i struggle with a lot of the same problems, not as much of the anxiety and asthma, but i have some pretty bad depression and adhd that i have to take medication for, and hearing you talk about having the same problems makes me feel a lot more human."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,"amazing editors. the time is takes from trey, vincent and jack to make these. i am incredibly grateful for these, they are amazing videos!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-21,"i appreciate your vulnerability and willingness to be open about what you're going through and how you're getting along. its a bit relieving to see that even the people we look to are just as human, dealing with similar issues. we're all just going through it and thank you for making this game more digestible and fun! i've not played fromsoft games before so when i first downloaded elden ring, i was massively overwhelmed by the world and mechancis  not an incredibly accessible game  and your playthrough made it much less intimidating. to see this game through the lens of a passionate fan was a treasure! i've even started elden ring up again and can finally appreciate the artistry of it without the overwhelm. i'll definitely be watching through allllll your long form vids"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-23,when you talk about other things while playing a full game from start to finish it's actually relaxing even if you're talking about the heavy stuff. i think one of the things i like most about you is how human you are. you have some people who play off as if they aren't human but what makes you different is how human and relatable you are
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,"watching sean play the games he genuinely loves shines through. this is entertaining because every actions he makes and every word he says is from the heart so he isn't really doing a bit. best of all, he's giving honest opinions about a game he loves, both praise and criticism, while also being civil and constructive. keep being you sean because you are doing a great of work making people happy by sharing your happiness!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,as someone who's read stormlight since middle school hearing jack make all these references is just making me geek out sooooo hard!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,this has become my go to comfort video and my favorite part everytime is when he says there's no go in the ground in this game and proceeds to select the emote directly next to it1010 will probably watch again tonight
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,the best part of these long videos is that its all edited and somehow enjoyable throughout the whole thing cant wait for a sekiro run
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"jackaboi is this ur way of telling us to get ready for a full playthrough of the shadow of the erdtree, ive been reeeeeeaaaaadyyyyyyyy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-22,"i love how the beginning bits of the game while he's doing what every elden ring player does at the beginning of a playthrough, he's trying to justify it lol. i personally love watching the longer process."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"90410 i know i'm extremely late, but seeing jack putting the ring on ranni and hearing if you like it then you should of put a ring on it in the background is funny as hell, hat's up to the editors for this one!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-11,jack be like heres 12 hours of game. byeeeeeee!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"your long let's play series have definitely filled more of my life than an afternoon. i still go back and rewatch your let's plays regularly. don't underestimate what your content means to people. for lonely people, the types like me who don't maintain real friendships, just sitting down and watching you play a game fills a hole. and there are games i've played just because you played them and they seemed fun. yeah, doing the constant indie horror games was not my cup of tea. but i love stuff like this, your god of war playthroughs, your spiderman playthroughs, etc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"what a fucking legend posted all 12 hours of gameplay and edited it too the editing probably took ages and yet jack did all of this for us props to him, what a legend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-21,"a drawing room, when they were first created, were rooms that you could go to after a meal to relax. originally called a withdrawing room. it was a place to feel safe and comfortable. asking someone to withdraw to the drawing room with you was an invitation to get to know the guest better  hearing jack talk about his depression and anxiety makes me feel so seen. it's not often talked about by people that i actually look up to. it's nice to know that i'm not going through this thing alone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,sean dropping the stormlight archives references is giving me life 3 so glad more people are reading this series
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-07,took me about 2 weeks to finish watching this in its entirety during the little free time i get. well done! loving these long format videos. you inspired me to finally finish this game for the first time. thanks jack!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"i know im late to the game on this video, but i have watched this far more than id like to admit and honestly the commentary. editing. game sounds. make for not only a great video to go to sleep to but also something i look forward to watching for hours before or after bed! loved your content since i was like 1011 22 now haha will continue to do so! rest well mate  its deserved"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-18,i work alone in a bakery at super early hours and long videos like these are so comforting to watch and keep me company while i work
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,im a 35 years father and husband and i've been watching you for many years. you're a real inspiration. you remind me often to just have fun. i often try to be perfect and get overwhelmed and stressed. these videos are a real voice of calm. thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-23,"answering jack's question. halig is the old english word for holy, so it is basically the holy tree. btw you can use the wild strikes ash of war with your weapon and it's extremely fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,51506 pick it up! bonk dont tell me what to fukin do.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-10,60125 i love that you do full play throughs all in one video. i can watch as much as i want and pick up where i left off at anytime. i have watched all of your videos like this one makes me feel like i get to play the game with you. i have watched most of your videos from your channel and enjoy you always show the full games while making it entertaining. sets you apart from the rest and i appreciate all the effort you put into your channel. thank you. in my opinion youre the best youtuber
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-28,"im going through a lot right now and its been hard to distract myself, but your trip through the tedious bits of rays lucaria made me feel a lot better for a few moments and i really appreciate that. much love"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-27,really pushing the 10 min mark huh?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,sean you do not understand how much i needed this rn. gosh srsly the perfect timing. thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,"i don't know why but the intermission at 50258 had me crylaughing, whoever put that in, thank you so much"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,for the people that chose the wrong start. you can become whatever you want later in the game. dont stress yourself and have fun.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,the absolute best is definitely the wretch... u get a mace with roar and are left alone in the world... what else would one ask for?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,confessor because drip
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-03,"lets be honest, it doesnt matter whon you started with, its what you do with the character"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-01,"drip is the most important hence why i chose prisoner for my first run, bosses are lucky there isnt a charisma stat because one look at that helmet and they would be gone."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-27,"wretch gets to have the most fun. just about any piece of equipment you find at the start is an upgrade, so its more exciting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-02,samurai for easy start vagabond for flexibility wretch if you know what youre doing the rest is if you already decided on a specific play style in which case you dont really need any advice for starting class
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,i honestly enjoyed the prisoner quite a bit. i've always liked being able to do hybrid classes in games like elden ring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-29,"samurai is the only class i would attempt a starting equipment run. in fact that sounds fun, i think i will attempt this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,ill be starting my own journey through elden ring soon. its not exactly the kind of game id usually play but im going to be open minded.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-06,"hot take the warrior is extremely good. powerstanced curved swords have arguably the best moveset in the whole game, and you get them right away. also the fit is pretty tough"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,"confessor is the best because it gives you an additional broadsword highest dps infusible straightsword, which means you can dual wield them without ng"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-23,"confessor. nice stat spread, good starting weapon, 100 physical reduction shield, useful spells, amazing drip. of course, it depends on what you want to focus on and the build you're looking for among many other factors but i think that the confessor is somewhat underrated"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,"even though i agree with the statement, i feel like vagabond or warrior are better for the weapons they do get they dont get bleed but they get mutiple meaning you have some great armor vagabond or one of the best builds jump attacks with the dual curved swords the bleed argument for the uchi is not relevant since you can get either an uchigatana or nagakiba if you are a monster and kill yura, bleed can be accessed with just bloody slash from the godrick knight from a nearby fort i forgot the name of the fort. vagabond is a great introduction to multiple weapons and warrior is a great starting class for dps and optimization and the drip is underrated. correct me if im wrong and im sorry if i made a mistake writing about the vagabond or warrior class. edit and the drip from the samurai is not that far since you can get it from a merchant in dragonbarrow."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-05,"i mean, i for one chose prophet and i absolutely love it. you start with an enemy melter, and the most faith out of all the starting classes, meaning you have a head start in incantations. additionally, you also start with an incantation that two shots revenants and the undead. to be fair, confessor also has it, but hey, its my first run."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,"i love the versatility of the confesor cuz you can do strengthfaith or dexfaith classes with it, you get the ability to use incantations very early and that is great"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-30,"i did samurai my first couple playthroughs and have moved onto warrior now. ive begun to enjoy guard counters and parrying quite a lot, never was good at it until i tried more often thanks to the new physick from the dlc"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,vagabond has the most rounded stats to br whatever you want
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,"also note that the samurai's startijg armor set is the best statwise of all the starting class armors, so starting with an armor set that you dont feel the need to replace until later down the line is big plus for the class. its probably the main reason i pick it over wretch, because i dont like looking around for early spare armor pieces."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-20,hero then you rush the large club. ungabunga till the credits roll.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-26,"best one, is whichever one has the closest stat allocation for the buildweapon youre trying to run tbh"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-03,the samurai is cool an all but that wretch tho ... thats where its at!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-06,started about a week ago and chose wretch cause i personally like starting a clean slate on stat building. it's been a fun game so far! i already want to make a new character with a different build to try the weapons i couldn't use this play through
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,"forgot to mention that it also has the best armor setup. while vagabonds armor is better in stats, samurai gets more endurance and the armor is lighter which means you get to midroll with all of the equipment"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-03,"i mean, uchi is a weapon some people would run most of the game with, which is pretty bonkers to give as a starter. i used a knight as i always do and enjoyed that full block shield."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-26,"samurai is the most common, but i think the confessor is the best. you have good starting equipment and armor, plus a healing incantation."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,i agree. also you can get another uchigatana from limgrave to power stance.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-04,"i'm still in nggames with my first character astrologer, just changeing builds in every ng. i still haven't played a completly new game with different class."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-15,"i choose warrior because i liked how it looks, i've changed pieces of the armot but use the cloth helmet unless there's a tough fight ahead"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,i actually agree  the samurai class is pretty insane
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,hell yeah! just started the game and picked samurai because i wanted a sword and bow. also looked cool. glad its gonna pay off.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,i used the samurai armour from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. never looked back until after i had beaten the final boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,"the best starting class depends on your build plan. that being said, wretch, confessor, samurai and vagabond can all go straight through the game picking up talismans and smithing stones along the way. wretch can pick up the incantation scarab helm in limgrave to help with defense."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-18,completely depends on what you want your main build to be but if you want to use the larvel tear to switch builds which you probably will if its your first playthrough i recommend the one with the even stats
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,i chose the naked one because the other ones seemed overwhelming
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-09,glad he is my first pick. if there is a samurai in a game its my choice lol. just started playing my first time. great game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,"i prefer the wretch since you get base stats at 10. but its certainly easier to start out as another class, but once you get to like level 150200 you don't need to worry about what class you are."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,as always though the vagabondknight has the highest starting stats and if you take the stone sword key as your starting item you can get an early game katana
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,"not only look cool, but is one of the best early game armor sets"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-04,its actually sorcerer build since you can get meteorite staff and rock sling supper early and youre set for the entire game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-26,"when i first played i had no idea what i was doing, but i picked prisoner because i thought it would be the hardest class to play as."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"looking cool is def the only thing that matters for amor. for me, if it doesnt have a cape, im not wearing it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-29,it simply depends on what build you want to do. my usual starting route works with any of them.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"my picks are samurai at 1 and confessor at 2, the points for samurai have been made already in the video. confessor starts with a quick heal spell, decent drip, and a sword and shield combo thats pretty damn good. the drawbacks of these 2 are that the confessor stealth spell sucks but the book that has it is also a pain to find, and that although the samurai does have a shield it sucks golem balls and is worthless."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-15,"the samurai allows you to duel wield uchigatanas. of course, you have to locate the second one separately. or you could wait for new game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-03,my first time my brother said be the wretch and i couldnt get past the tutorial. then i started some time again with the sorcerer and im building int and dex its working out great so far i like having spells and a quick sword. way better than starting naked
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,i agree but a close second is vagabond because of two reasons you start with a square off straight sword and if you add the great helm on your armor set you get knight drip and protection
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-11,people who choose class for their stats and weapons  people who choose class for their drip
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,"top 5 1. samurai  stated above 2. barbarian  strarc easy to make a good str build early on 3. prisoner  dexint spread, easy access to katana plus play cards right for early grandeur 4. vagabond good quality spread, especially for a novice, allows for an easy early physical build 5. wretch  good point spread, easy levels, best for a 3rd character challenge runs"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-10,you take what's the best for you build if you want strength and dex go with the lowest int or arcane faith mostly enhance str and dex builds with buffs with little points it all depends on your build choose the class with the lowest stat you don't want it in your build but in the end it's only effect 1 to 2 points at max.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,i upgraded to the white reed set.. then equipped the marais mask.. now im using the scaled armor with the black wolf mask..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-17,confessor or samurai. confessor just has a base faith stat that covers most buff spells.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-09,"i think if you want to blaze through the game really quickly from the start, vagabond or confessor for square off is best"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-11,i think i used the warrior starting class for my very 1st play thru on ps4. since then ive been a katana boi in every play thru since lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-29,i went astrologer route because it's a jack of all trades and using magic for range attacks makes switching in and out of combat
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,plus blood slash from that knight at fort heaight
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,samurai... its samurai that it..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-19,i think the video answers the question which is the class with the best starting gear. personally i find the vagabond the best melee starting class without needing any level up. you can get good melee weapons early and the armour is the best melee starting armour. if you like playing safer from range then astrologer.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-06,astrologer because there's nothing quite like playing magic man who can be destroyed by slightly stronger breeze yes i play wizards and warlocks in dd before anyone asks
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-05,mine is prisoner. i wanna parry from the start
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,i love the warrior cuz you have so much freedom
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-01,"the best is the bandit. has bow, bleed knife, and quickstep for dodging. dodge then crit butt stab"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"from an early game perspective, i'd say vagabond, samurai, warrior and sorcerer whatever it's called"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-04,pick whatever fits for your build if you dont have a build in mind go wretch its made for anything
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-24,i chose samurai cause it was dripped out and samurais are cool
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-11,"samurai is easily the best. cracked starter weapon, a bow, a shield, decent armor, and the stats lend themselves to making any build you want since the mental stats are all right around 10."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,start as wrench guys you wont regret it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-07,wretch is the best starting class 10 stats in every attributes while at level 1 its harder at the start but easier mid  endgame
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,its not about whats best its about what you want to play. samurai is just a obvious pick because it has the most stuff
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-03,akhem achtually wretch is incredible because you got base stats of 10 at sl1 leveling that shot is dollartree cheap and we got coupons
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,looking cool in elden ring is definitely an end game activity unless you're a samurai
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-08,start as confessor and then beeline to that tomb with the uchigatana. that's the correct answer
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,"me, literally a noob and went on a whim to change from hero to samurai before clicking on this video"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-04,im definetely making a new safe with the samurai
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-25,"even though i've played bloodborne and sekiro before, elden ring is my first foray into the more traditional dark souls experience. so vagabond seemed like the most obvious choice. it's been crazy fun so far!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-08,dude didn't even mention the shield you start with which has parry. some people can use that skill to beat the first boss in the chapel of anticipation making samurai class even better
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-02,i always play wretch level 1 balance stats at 10 so i can build how i want it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-08,prisoner is good for the spell and the spell could kill the scion at the start with the right amount of skill
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-25,meanwhile me with confessor and grave scythe death whistle intensifies yes im doing a grim reaper build
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-03,i've been running a prophet and to be honest it's not the easiest to start with but the faith is amazing
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-23,okay well this is for dex builds if you want to start as a strength build go vagabond if you want to go for an int build pick the astrologer or if you're just going for one of those faith builds i would either recommend the prophet or the confessor because both of those are actually pretty good for an early start for faith incantation builds. but don't be afraid to make your own bills and your own designs there are literally thousands of armor pieces in weapons in this game some are the best some are pretty s if you were mostly one trick ponies but they still work nonetheless overall find something that's easy for you to play or that you want to try an attempted but if you want to beat the game easily first to understand the full game before you make a build i would suggest going pure strength since now they are considered the best build with the biggest and strongest weapons in the game that will crush bosses trust me it will be easy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-28,looking cool in elden ring is really all thats matters actually i wouldnt mind beating a few bosses.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-16,i actually agree with this
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,personally wretch is best imo. simply because you will get overall better stats and a lower level meaning the few early levels will be cheaper which in the long run means you get the same strength for less runes than other characters will need to pay. and if we are talking about the really close to maxlevel costs... yeah that absolutely goes a long way
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,bandit for early bleed builds.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-27,im starting with prisoner class and now im a dragon incantation user
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,i did the math. the wretch actually has the best stats for its level.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,samurai starts with a way too powerful weapon
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-10,"nah it's vagabond the longsword is very versatile weapon and you can equip it with some very strong ashes of war in the early game bloody slash,carian grandeur,etc. and you have enough starting strength and dex to switch out for basically any weapon later,bastard sword,claymore,sword of night and flame,nagakiba and so on,additionally they have the the highest starting vigor out of any other class so your survivability is pretty good..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-14,"wretch is best and most versatile. everything from the samurai you can get in the very early game with literally zero effort. but yeah, i love samurai, too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-22,depends and what build you planning to do
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-09,samurai is my go to
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-07,unsheath is great all the way through from start to endgame
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-11,confessor because drip
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-13,uga buga is only class in soulselden i need
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-02,i'll try that next time
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-05,"born to be samurai starting class, forced to live with vagabond stats"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,imo its the deprived class due to you being able to change from a bleed build to a strength fairly easily although i did i pick champion class first i wish i couldve know it first.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-18,prophet is the best class catch flame is the second best incantation in the game you could easily beat the game with only catch flame
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-07,vagabond for stat maxing and samurai if you want a strong initial character
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,use code eso50 to get 50 off your first factor box plus 20 off your next month of orders at httpsbit.ly3wcmjkm ad!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,"i'm 16 minutes in and let me just say that you did this perfectly, you assumed as a beginner we are not so familiar with the map and locations and you added extra information that you correctly assumed a begginner would not know. all other guides go too fast and assume some knowledge. after many videos and guides  because i didnt want to play hours and restart because i cant kill anything  i will stick with this guide and build. thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-10,this is the best er guide ever created. i am lvl 247 on the dlc. now i will start a new character and follow this guide!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-12,this is my first souls game and honestly starting off i was extremely lost in the sauce. had no clue what to do or where to go but this helped a ton. i followed each step and now the game is a lot more feasible for me. thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"after 2h and 33min , im level 54 and have done everything in the guide , is work like a charm ! i guess the part 2 will be in long time ? anyway thank a lot is allow to chill more and discover the game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,"for anyone who killed the dragon, west of the lennes rise grace there is a summoning metal ball that you can do a circle around and every time it falls of the cliff, it gives you 1952 runes every time you kill it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,please continue this! works like a charm
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,thank you for this. complete noob to elden ring. this guide is much easier and beginner friendly than most others i have come accross. excellent.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-11,incase anyone don't believe it works i'm a newbie at elden ring and i followed this guide and i manged to get the ruins
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-15,the ultimate beginners guide to elden ring. thank you eso
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-25,is there a part 2  ive followed this build step by step and now ready to continue it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"eso, im so glad youre still doing game guides. youre a good dude, keep it up man."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,started my first playthough friday and its crazy how ive done 34 of these things without having any idea whatsoever of what i was doing lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,"merry christmas! this guide has helped me a lot, i was just wondering where part two is?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-04,"coming back here after i beat the game. this was the first guide i ever used, and i decided to go the bloodflame nagakiba route. a month later i'm starting a new playthrough and here i am again, this time i'm actually going the bloodhound fang route. cheers!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,because of this guide elden ring has become my fav game thank you dude
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-06,checking if there is a part 2 for this. thanks for the detailed guide eso!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"great guide, thank you for this. i would love to see beginner guides for all the starting classes, especially a tank build with shield for the vagabond."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-05,use this build and get the mimic tear. level the fang to max and the tear as high as you can. any boss you can summon for almost becomes trivial.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,"i just hit lvl 60 ish with this exact build. this guy is 100 legit, although i would suggest getting a serpent bow as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,thanku so much it works still till this day
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-18,"finally decided to play this seriously after having it downloaded for so long, thank you for the help"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,even though i'm around level 230 i couldn't help but watch the entire video xd
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,when part 2 releasing i need it the build is just 2 good and i want to now the correct stuff to lvl up
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-29,"hey i have tip that might help in this walkthrough, its better to get 300k runes from the dragon grinding in the starting itself dont stop at 100k and get 200k on later. why im saying this is there a big chance of messing the dragon grinding. so if you stop at 100k and continue the walkthrough you have to get another 200k later on almost where the video ends if you mess that up at the end it would be so frustrating. so try to get 300k at starting if you fail, start from beginning it will only take 2530mins"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"hey eso , great video as usual. i have a great nostalgia about your old guides of skyrim and fallout about ten years ago  good old times.."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,"thank you so, so muchhh for your entire 40 video playlist for elden ring help. much much appreciated brother."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-09,"this is just what i needed to finally get back to elden ring, thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"lov u dawg, i just started elden ring a few days ago and after defeating the tree sentinel after over 100 tries i rly wanted a good weapon to start off the game a bit easier in the early level cause i kinda felt i proved myself after defeating that fker, this video rly helped out a lot"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-15,thanks for the guide. i accidentally killed the dragon the second time so had to take a long detour to do the crow farm. i am looking forward to the next step in the path.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-10,omg i just finished this whole video and even though it took me so long it was soooo worth it!!! tysmmm

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,"i struggled with demon's souls because of it's hardcore difficulty resulting in a lack of interest, but i wanted to try elden ring because of my excitement for medieval rpgs. this was a perfect guide for me to get into the game mechanics and lore, while building momentum to start progressing through the storyline. thanks!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,i put 200 hrs in at release and came back to start over. this guide is awesome. i screwed the dragon up on run one but after doing the initial run you can get back to the exact spot in 15 mins so just start over if you kill the drag. does it make sense to get any more stats from the dragon before we move on? awesome guide!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-11,just finished this build exactly by the video as i only started playing yesterday. really enjoying this build as it was close to what i wanted anyway. super fun and can't wait to see how it progresses from here.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,"thanks so much, this game was very hard to understand but youve helped me so much!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,thank you so much! im max level 713 on ng6 but i did it with rune drops. this guide helped me level up without rune drops and i love it. now i can struggle a lil bit to give myself a challenge. lol

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-15,"i always go get the the blood spell north in the water near the ruined sorcery town and cast that on my katana for insane increase in bleed proc, i am able to do about 13 hits per bleed instead of the 2834 it takes depending on your build per bleed proc. saves me lots of time and i stay on my horse to i do not miss out on accidently not reaching the grace before he dies which happened to me a few times."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,"great video. subscribed, but is pt. 2 happening?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-07,does anyone know why i didnt get the blaide sent me option with the blacksmith ??
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,wheres part 2 eso!?!?! we need you!!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,did this step by step was easy thinks !
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,i was bullied into submission. here is the reupload with the correct changes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,they literally put their foolish ambitions to rest
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,put these foolish ambitions to rest alrighty then
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-08,tree sentinel after beating the shit out of 5.5 million players don't ever come back
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,not as bad as 12 of subnautica players failing to touch the water
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,"put these foolish ambitions to rest. me seems reasonable, have a nice day."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"coincidentally, there was a petition for the inclusion of an easy mode in elden ring that got over 5 million signatures."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"the tree sentinel and i have a long standing beef. he kills me, i damage him."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-10,my first playthrough was straight out of a meme. i went basically straight to the trapped chest that takes you far in caelid
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-09,the tree sentinel being placed there by the devs just to fuck with people knowing they couldnt beat it is the funniest thing of all time
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,it's like this for almost all games. very early steam achievements usually hover in the 6090 area
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,my friend literally started and got stuck on him and i'm like dude you got an entire world to explore just go around
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,whats funny is that killing the tree sentinel gives you a weapon that requires a very high level of strength so even if you kill him you cant use the weapon until you get stronger
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,"whats even funnier is they literally didnt even explore the game either. you can get to the roundtable hold without even seeing a single boss health bar by just running straight to caelid and resting at any grace there. they literally bought an open world game just to not explore the open world  granted most of these people could be playing offline, have achievements disabled because mods, or just didnt enjoy the game like they thought they would and refunded it. edit i have no clue how this became a conversation about the games quality and boss originality but go ahead and check the replies if youre bored"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-22,limgrave tree sentinel has killed more players than any boss in the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,probably those people who hit the friendly dude when you get out of the tutorial and then he just starts beating you up
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,a fun head canon is that the worthless hollows you see on the first path by the gate front ruins are those players that had their foolish ambitious put to rest
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,"i didnt even know the tree sentinel was a boss. i just walked out of the crypt, a dude told me to go die in a ditch, i saw a dude on a horse, and i just went around him"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,i for sure got stuck at the tree sentinel and said this game is impossible. came back a year later once i learned i was playing it wrong and to save the sentinel for later and it is one of the greatest games i've ever played lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-07,the tree sentinel only took me 5 tries but after seeing that everyone had such insane problems with it i guess i was just built different.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,fun fact there is also a bug that is very rare where you are never brought to the round table and it basicaply softlocks part of the end game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-08,my first time i was struggling with the tree sentinel then i said lest go this way behold a fucking dragon came out the sky and burned me one of the best headaches i ever bought
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,i can vividly remember the tree sentinel fight being stupidly easy up until the shield attacks started coming out. jank hitboxes were the death of me for roughly 1520 tries before i gave up and came back after going to the caelid party lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,"it took me 2 hours to beat tree sentinel on my first time, even though i knew he was an optional boss from lilaggy streamsi watched elden ring speedruns before i bought it now i can beat him with my fists, crazy how people improve in souls games"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,tree sentinel you will fail!!! new player k bye!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,every game owned has a minimum of 20 of owners never playing owned game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,"this is common in a lot of games, check how many call of duty players never even do the first mission of the campaigns, millions of people buy games every year that they never even start"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-18,"i fought tree sentinal for a week straight like every day i attempted it for 3060mins. my gpu was a potato, i was lagging, i didnt go to get the horse. it was just me with a shield and a sword."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-10,the first achievement of subnautica when you literally just need to jump in water like people was like  oh hell nah
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,"nah man we just chillin. you know, waiting for the right moment to play"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,bruh it took me over a week to realize you have to sit at the site of grave with the merchant to be able to get the spirit bell and have access to the round table hold.. was out there struggling fighting bosses with no upgrades or spirits lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,margit put these foolish ambitions to rest! players okay  ....
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-15,i dunno how people can just drop it like that. the tree sentinel beat the shit outta me so much i couldn't stop till i killed it. can't wait to get passed the fire giant
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,"there is a glitch on seamless coop where this achievement won't unlock even if you were in roundtable hold. the problem is that the achievement only unlocks after you speak with melina. so if you are playing with someone and they speak with melina after resting at the grace, you won't be able to speak with her as she doesn't spawn anymore, and even if you warp to the rh, you still won't get the achievement till you make a new save or go to ng and speak with her yourself."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,"when i first got the game, that was me because i never played a souls game before. after a few months, i watched a lot of elden ring videos and read a bunch of guides and finally platinumed it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,"dark souls 2 had this covered by putting the achievement of dying for the first time, nearly 92 of players received the achievment and from then the playerbase drops masively since the last giant is the third achievement on the game and only 69 of players found and beated him"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,there should have been an achievement for losing to the sentinel for reference
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-10,"im so used to ds1, when i got to the table i didnt know how tf to leave"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,you dont even need to beat margit you just need to explore for long enough
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"i made it past, and touched the grace i even killed the tree sentinel, i just never rested to get the cutscene at the grace."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-16,i think some of them were playing without being connected because if you're not connected to wifi while you're playing achivements doesn't count
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,or they just never rested at a grace
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,tree sentinel accidentally being a gatekeeper boss is the most soulsborne thing ever
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,"thanks for the in depth alpha miles, trust that us viewers with long attention spans appreciate the content, happy holidays!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,"this is hilarious to me as someone that first beat the tree sentinel at level 23, as well as someone that beat margit at lvl 5 by just poking him repeatedly with square off xd"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,"that was me in 2022, got reeled in by the hype and gave up after a while... but fast forward to september of this year and i gave it another shot due to the dlc and it's now my most favorite game ever and after 700 hours, still having fun, absolute banger, changed my perspective on games forever"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,i know one of my friends who beat the game by never going to the roundtable hold he just said i didnt trust that girl
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,funny enough i actually beat radahn and rykard and restored their great tunes before i ever entered the roundtable hold. my steam achievements look incredibly funny. 1st i beat radahn 2nd was godskin noble 3rd was rykard 4th was restore a great tune 5th was roundtable hold 6th was defeat godfrey what a run.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,that tree sentinel probably has more kills than any other enemy in the game lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"that's literally me!  i actually wrote my friends this golden dude is whooping my a big time, am i doing it wrong?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,12 hours of game time to reach roundtable is wild to me lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,you dont even need to kill anyone to get to the rth. you just need to get to anywhere outside limgrave or weeping penninsula.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-06,plot twist all those players beat the game without using bonfires
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,"actually in one of my saves i go stuck at margit for so long, i went to the grace before margit to realize i could go to the roundttable hold before beating margit"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,i legit forgot about that boss only to find him later on when decided to buy everything from merchants
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,that one indian guy defeating the tree sentinel not knowing you could skip it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,it's with most games on steam. many people just didn't play the game. i probably have like 50 games which i launched for a minute and put to the 'later'.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"it took me a whoppin 20 hours to get this one. just went straight south to explore, and the event just never triggered until i returned."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,and funny enough that tree sentinel and margot are not that problematic boss in term of fast combo like most bosses later on. i find them quite a good teacher
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,tree sentinel really out there dropping the player count by himself
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"i actually just reached the roundtable till half of the game, i was just looking on the map and randomly saw something in the left corner"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,now i can never skip the tree sentinel when starting new character..i must be at him
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,miyazaki probably laughing his a off to you right now
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"i found a really easy way to beat these tho, pick bandit and level up dexterity just a few times, then head near the cave that patches is in and fight the summoned enemy with a reduvia, circle around him for a bit until that cool ass invader comes to help you, let him kill the enemy and you get a reduvia in less than 10 minutes of playing the game. that alone got me through the first 4 bosses"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,"ahh tree sentinel, you took 4 hours from me, but i got the last laugh ahahahahah!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,i didnt get to the roundtable for about 15 hours. but i had explored every corner of the starting area.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"the funny thing with the tree sentinel. i saw him, said alright let's go, got one shot and immediately realized that i'm not supposed to fight him yet. it's not a terrible fight once you're leveled for it but it really shows you how the game should be approached. just because there's a thing to fight, doesn't mean you need to fight it right now."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,i can still remember how i came back to the sentinel when i just got my horse and fought him for an hour straight by riding in circles
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,put these foolish ambitions to rest yes boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-03,"i was just going over the steam player stats the other day and was surprised by the numbers. i beat the game maybe a month after launch doing the age of stars and elden lord endings. the steam stats for both endings for other players having done the same was really low, both less than 30 percent of the total player base. even with issues like achievements not being recorded and factoring in a margin of error, the numbers are just way too low. i just now got time to knock out shadow of the erdtree, and honestly it didn't take that long. when i originally started the game back in 2022, i did a lot of exploring on the northern part of the map as soon as it was possible. i know that is probably not ideal for many people, but for me it was a great way to get op faster for early bosses, and made the over all play through much easier after that initial 10 hours or so of grinding up north for loot, runes etc."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"if you start as vagabond he's not super hard to kill right away, just use the longsword with the square off heavy stab attack."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,yall got to the round table hold on 12 hours. takes me 6
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"i beat the sentinel after a couple hours after i realised i could just get stronger and come back and it was a super fun fight, especially when i had summons to help"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"that's extremelly common in most games tbh. a considerable amount of people drop the game at the very start. also, steam support page says achievements are not removed from your profile when you refund a game, so i believe you are still part of the statistics when you do that. i think it's safe to assume that a big part of the players that didn't get to the roundtable just straight up refunded the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"after 8 months of owning this game i just beat the tree sentinel it's a beautiful feeling but now i'm stuck again at the monster of fell , gonna need another couple of months for that one"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,"honestly the tree sentinal is still one of my favorite bosses, its where i leanred the mechanics of the game. i have played ds1 before and love that game, but mechanic wise, they're quite different."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,this tree sentinel at the beggining is for you to learn that you should not attack anything you see.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,"funny is, u dont need to fight margit, u can go around the castle and after sitting on the bonfire u get to the table place."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-31,me for 2 hours trying to kill the first npc at the start
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,the only thing you have to fight is the grafted scion. you can walk around everything else and theres a side path at the castle
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,i didnt even know tree sentinel existed my first play through lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"its like this with every game on steam, a lot of people just buy games and never play it. they also count to the people who are missing achievements. if there was an achievement for attacking or dodging once there would still be 1020 people not having it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,i was exploring and didn't knew where to progress
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-07,first achievement could be margit tbf or js go straight to liurnia and go to table
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,me killing the tree sentinel after leaving the tutorial to get the golden halberd filthy casuals.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,i didn't have this achievement til recently cause the first time i beat this game was with the convergence mod. currently doing my first vanilla playthrough and just beat mohg
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"thats only on steam though, a really important specification to make since the amount that actually never made it very far is probably way more than shown here"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-10,the reason the tree is so hard is due to his speed and horse with the weird timing of hi attacks at a low level it takes much longer to kill him leaving lots of room for error
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,you dont need to beat morgott to get to round table hold. just go straight to the caelid shrine you dont have fight the npc summon either you can jump up the rocks on the left side of the shrine and go straight through the side to the bonfire that will take you to roundtable hold and it doesnt break questlines.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,i access the roundtable within the first 20 minutes. go grab the steed and head to caelid. rest at a site of grace and boom. twin maiden husks being unlock sooner and hewg is good setup for a smooth run early on.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"something to keep in mind is that if elden ring is bought on a console or on steam, all the accounts on the console or all the profiles on the game share on steam can get achievements for the game, so i believe the vast majority of those who dont have the first achievement are those who just have access to the game without purchasing it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,the fun thing about elden ring is you can get to the roundtable without killing a single boss. not sure what the perimeters are but i got it in my second playthrough from just running past stormveil and tping to calid
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,you also have to take into account all the challenge and speed runners who just don't use it sometimes
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,"nah, i don't need this red haired maiden. i know that there's a hot witch who's better"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,casuals couldnt find the round table unless it hit them in the face
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-09,when i saw the tree sentnale for the first time i said hell no and booked it in the opposite direction
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,loreaccurate tarnished besides the chosen one
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,i died at the roundtable and thought it was a one time thing
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,i dont know the round table was a site of grace till now lmaoo
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,"imagine walking around stormcastle by accident, getting the grace behind it and be allowed in the roundtable without doing anything...."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,click the related video link to watch the full video or don't lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,is it possible to beat the tutorial boss in elden ring? proceeds to not answer the question
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,"short answer, yes you can. i defeated it as a vagabond and got the swords and shield"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,sky on? s  ion! sigh  on!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,he did all that yapping and still didn't gave us the awnser
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-23,man said skyon
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-22,"the funniest part is that you can, but after you do so you walk away and get so distracted by the scenery that you fall off of a cliff into the melenia cutscene"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,"this reminds me of the first fight with virgil in devil may cry five youre not supposed to beat it, but if you do the game just cuts to the credits and ends"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,jesus dude if i have to hear sky on one more time
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,"the funny thing is this is not a scripted death, there is a script related to dying to him for the very first time, but you do not need to die to him you can beat him it's just not easy. and you will get good loot from him"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,dude just say yes you can thats all it took like bruh
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-25,the german youtuber zombey made his whole first elden ring video about beating the tutorial boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-18,i love it when he tells what happens after we defeat the boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,aint no way bro really said heavy roll isnt that bad
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-28,"sky on? nah man, its sigh on"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,i think the best starting class to do this with is the prophet because it starts with the heal maricle. the samurai is good too. the scion can't close that fast and it doesn't have a ranged attack so backing off to heal or shoot an arrow is always a good idea.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,i love the part when he gave the answer
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-30,"you can parry him, but it's kinda tricky since it has several hands. but it's doable, i did it after several attempts."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-23,grafted sighon is how its pronounced
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-17,"ill save yall watching the full video, it is possible. you get the same loot as when you fight it later in the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-03,"i saw a great comment on elden ring bosses if it can bleed, it can die"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,get the mage clas for long distance damage?  get samurai for bow
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-17,i love the part where he answers the question he asked.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,i killed him on ng and had to fell to void without losing runes to spawn in the cave normally
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-16,love the part where he answered the question
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-26,give me my 60 seconds back
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-19,it's so possible that the boss then is just a normal enemy later on
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-09,you can actually come back to defeat the grafted scion if you die at the four belfries
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,imagine if samurai got a low taper fade
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-30,"it is possible, a german youtuber named zombey did it on the day elden ring was released. with the confessor starting class."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,its a staple in all of from games. minus bloodborne. where the tutorial boss is optional. and if you do beat them. you get the earliest upgrade in game. being his weapons and shield... plus early runes
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-02,technically thats not the tutorial boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-04,"you can answer the question without even hesistation, yes you can kill him, you just need the skill"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-24,"we need to have a sit down as a community to decide what constitutes a tutorial boss. this is a suppose to lose boss. we have an established tutorial boss, he is literally the boss at the end of the tutorial."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-15,"easiest way to do it is to start with the vagabond class. twohand the longsword and use the square off weapon art. two heavy iirc attacks with square off will put the grafted scion into stunned frames where you can execute a critical hit. the vagabond has enough fp that you can simply repeat this strategy until the scion is dead. it isn't foolproof, because you still have to avoid its attacks, but with good timing you should still be able to interrupt his attacks before they connect, and the entire fight should only take about a minute and a half tops, so if you screw it up, it's not nearly as tedious to simply start a new character. trying to bow snipe the scion to death takes like, 10 minutes, which is excruciating if you keep getting him to half health before being tagged twice and dying."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,ironically you die either way a little later by falling
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-18,oh so we can come back eventually? perfect
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,mf came back with guts sword
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-29,people were beating this guy on day one my guy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-21,"technically yes, and if i understand correctly, doing so grants the swords and shield"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"the easiest way is to use bucklers parry. forget wich class it is but i used it on a parry run and the weapon you start with does inflict bleed. the boss becomes infinitely easier to at least make a run on or even defeat at the very begining. for those wanting a way to make the class speed run the game learn parry, get reduvia and then get a katana to add bleed affinity too later on, stagger hits still affect 5ue bleed gauge so it is very viable for a parry build. str build is good too but only for late game level so i recommend doing an arcane dex build with parry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-06,yes you can and if you continue after him the gronder will fall under your feet and you will be in the next part of the game line when he kill you or if you fall at the edge
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-12,when i first got the game i thought i was just really bad after i died
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,"you absolutely can. if you beat it, you're supposed to get tricked into moving to the butterflies at the end of the last platform, which collapses to kill you and start the next cutscene."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,wth my vision just went dark and i woke up in that cave as soon as i saw the boss
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-07,short answers you can but you will fall of the cliff
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-18,i love the part there he answers the initial question.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-24,"truth is, the game was rigged from the start"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,you see the bar moves right?! it can bleed so it can die
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-16,"i did it on my first playthrough, never played any fromsoft games before, and i am just finding out it was not supposed to be defeated, the heck"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-07,"ha, i did the same thing when i beat him. when i figured out my arrows did damage, i use the jelly fish to sting him and shot my arrows at a distance"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-13,on the second play through i usually defeat the scion and than jump off the cliff
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-13,"everyone once they get to new game   when you last saw me, i was but a noob, now i am the master"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-01,"when someone asks if the tutorial boss is actually possible, thats when you know its a hard game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-19,"not only is it possible, it is easily doable"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,ive done it before with vagabond build
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-01,the tutorials after that part when you wake up in the cave you jump down in the hole
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-26,get stronger first then do a rematch at the four belfries
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-17,"i beat him as sorcerer, it got tough when i ran out of fp but i had my stick and i won. one of the proudest moments of my elden ring journey."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-24,it just turned black in the middle of the fight withouth dying
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-07,"if you killed him, in the end of the hills youll fall and dead"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,i've never played elden ring but love your channel
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"not only is it possible, it isn't even that difficult lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,did...did he just say skyon?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-13,it always feels good to beat the boss that you couldnt kill but that you can kill with the most op load out when you remember it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,ng  1 hit grafted scion
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-08,in every soulslike game you'll face a really strong enemy as soon you start the game. in every soulslike it is possible to kill such enemy and in almost every victory it will give an item that will give you a nice advantage on early game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-14,the c is silent.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-11,you definitely has a phd on yapping
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,"scion, not skyon  scion, like sigh or psycology hahahah keep up the great work and videos, my guy  just giving you a hard time  thanks for the laugh!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-25,yes. saved you 55 seconds.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-12,elden ring shadow of the erdtree
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-16,ranged attacks and running away is how i fight most bosses in every game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-29,"there is a way to completely cheese that boss where its jumping attack traps it in place, if you have a ranged weapon you can avoid getting hit and whittle the enemy down before finishing it with the katana"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-16,"its actually quite easy to beat, seeing as the boss is just an enemy you can encounter in quite a few spots elsewhere in the game. its attack pattern is very easy to learn and leaves plenty of openings, and it is parryable. the main difficulty actually comes from the lack of flasks, which means that the easiest class for a beginner to beat it with would likely be confessor with their strong shield, weapon and the ability to heal."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-13,you can climb a tree in the boss arena and be untouchable. it only took me about three tries to get the right angle on the tree
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,yes you can deafeat it but after you go to the grave area you fall into the void and wake up in the cave anyways
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-03,"it ain't scripted, just a bit hard for a first time player. it drops a pretty powerful sword and shield."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-30,nah he had it about right i walked straight off after opening the doors
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,exactly how i beat grafted scion
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,"yes you can, he drops his sword and shield but you'll fall, die and continue normally"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-15,"for those wondering since there is no answer , it is actually possible to beat the start boss , we just need skill or being in new game . if we beat it , we are getting his runes and we need to fall off the cliff , when we die after falling off we keep the runes"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-02,even shorter answer. close to the altus plateau there is portal that takes you back to this boss and you can fight it when you are much stronger
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,i can confirm you can. i watched a play through on elden ring and the person playing absolutely cooked the grafted scion. then he proceeded to go past the boss fight and jumped off the cliff to make the cutscene happen.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-10,"yes, all you need to do is not get hit more than 4 times after a certain amount of hp drains, the cutscene of you dying happens regardless. alternatively you can come back and kill this boss and get another spirit summon in the area later."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-21,"yes. every time i start a ng, i always make sure to defeat him before moving on."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,short answer is yes. on my first play through i kept making new characters to beat it on first time without having to wait the ng
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-17,tarnished  what if i don't run? what if i stand for it? what if i am not scared?... what if i want them to try...?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-13,this is like slapping the wolf in bloodbournes start to death
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-17,i somehow got caught in a bug where i couldnt take damage on my second play through and beat him did not feel right at all lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-21,well... for some reason they set a trap with butterfly just after this boss.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-16,phase two said everything lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"it also has a time limit, if you survive for too long without killing it you just teleport into the cave,"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,"after you defeat it, you fall off a cliff afterward."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-17,i got really close defeating it when i made my first character and then was happy when i realized that i was supposed to lose.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-26,after beating it i still died cus the cliff collapsed
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-14,ive actually found the tutorial boss on accident in my travels.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-30,"tbf, ranged damage doesn't suck if you use something like poison or bleed shots and a short bow at a safe distance"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,you know it might be as advantageous to... actually answer the question
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-21,"i saw it at the first playthrough of a youtuber! yes you can, then you get its weapons and continue further, until you fall off a cliff"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-08,"put this vid on to sleep to, woke up and it was still playing 910"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,this is truly the dark souls of lore videos
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-19,colours   red  health and flesh  amber?  divinity?  yellow  chaos and frenzy  green  stamina and animation  blue  focus and intelligence  purple  gravity and dreams  white  the endlessness of time  black  the end of time metals   silver  fluidity and mimicry  copperbronze  willpower  gold  order and power
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-17,gonna fall asleep listening to this and rinse and repeat until all of the lore is imprinted on my brain matter.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-13,i cried during that part about boggart hating himself yet trying to be a better person
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"the any speedrun for the game is currently 24m56s. accordingly, this game can be completed approx 22 times in the time it takes to watch this lore video."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,"4713 the thumb is the most important and creative part of the hand, but only because it so much more unhinged. as fire as the yellow chaos flame."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,playing elden ring for the first time. i've owned it since launch but deliberately left it until i had time to sit with it. what a brilliant video to help me immerse myself in the world. thanks for the mammoth amount of work that would have gone into this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,"damn, i remember right before elden ring released rewatching all these videos you guys have made hoping thered be a few cool videos to come out of it, and now theres a bloody 10 hour compilation, good shit guys"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"talking about how, eating red fruits wouldn't change your amount of blood or energy more. there's actually a touch of truth to that. most red fruits have a higher amount of iron in them, which attributes to their red hue, and iron helps build healthy red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-20,"this is probably one of the best indepth videos ever, the fact that your voice fits well and sounds very intellectual really helps. 9 hours gone just like that"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,"love that a 9 and a half hour video about fucking elden ring starts with nearly 2 hours about colour theory, this must truly be the dark souls of lore videos. 7 out of kevin thank you, i love it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-30,the crabs eating the mush shit is kinda cute. they just sit there munchin down on slop no thoughts goin through their little brains
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"amazing video, your voice and the depth of the lore. i spent more time on the video then on the game  thank you for the time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,hope you enjoy this epic video!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"thank you so very much for everything you've done in the souls games in terms of lore. your videos are always incredible, and i'm sure it is a ton of work to create and maintain"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"i literally can't get enough of hawkshaw videos. i rewatch them so often, over and over again. i'm always waiting for the new one, just awestruck about what you guys find every time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,we sleeping deep tonight bois!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-06,"gotta say i really appreciate this video. lost my 75 hour elden ring playthrough when i upgraded to ps5 and only just now am able to convince myself to pick it up again, this showed up on my feed at just the right time. you just carried me through a whole shift delivering packages, i appreciate that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,"this is my first video after subscribing to your channel. i'm so upset i haven't been here sooner, your voice, your attention to detail and adding info cards for simple confirmation on lore, seriously keep it up!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,if there wasn't an ad every 5 minutes i could fall asleep to this
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-17,oh boy cant wait to hear the backstory of all my favorite characters 2 hours of color theory im not hating i just thought it was funny
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,the beginning of this video is making my eyes wet. i've seen so many people being saved by those games and elden ring was there to carry me as well through some stuff. what a beautiful thing.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,"the only elden ring video you can fall asleep to, and still hear sweet lore when waking up the next morning"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-29,"the fact that ive seen most of this already, but could do with some refreshing, makes this the perfect video to listen to during work  awesome stuff as always"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,"watching a new series no. watching 10 hours of hawkshaw elden ring lore yes, please."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,i saw 9 hours ...immediately was thrilled
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"10 hours of elden ring lore, peak content, this should be put in theaters. absolute cinema. i love your work on this video, my 1st time seeing your channel."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-09,"only 30 minutes in and i am stunned, this is gonna be a treat. of the literal hundreds of hours of lore videos about elden ring i've listened to, it is the first one to approach the theme of colors and i really dig it so far. glad i found this, thanks for the work and cheers!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"i really like how you open this video with the colour theory. that reminds me the first important piece of the lore, revealed by the developers before release, was that our character is a tarnished, stripped of the colour gold, instead of red. looking back, vaati was really really close knowing now that the primordial gold has a red hue. your video makes me feel that were now at full circle, from the developers first lore reveal to the end of the main story development of elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,"20313 listening to you talk about color in such a professional manner for nearly 2 hours, and then hearing this not even ten minutes later is quite the tone shift if you ask me. 20331 i see why hes observing so fervently."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"arise ye tarnished, for we have been graced with the lore"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,i'm 15 minutes into this beast and it's already fantastic
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,"hawkshaw, bro, you and other lore creators helped me fall in love with elden ring even more. i didnt need much help but elden ring is great. the amount of ideas and themes are so deep, it almost makes me want to cry in awe. random, but i actually plan to get an elden ring tattoo. only my second tattoo."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,almost 7 hours in and i love this video perfect awnser to my youtube entirety of eldenring lore explained search
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,this is the greatest lore video ever compiled. well done hawkshaw you are the greatest lore theorist of soulsborne by a country mile.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-13,thank you so much for this wonderfully produced lore content
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-19,1 12 hours in now that we know the basic
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"i went to bed, woke up, and this vid was still playing. never has happened before"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,"dude honestly how you explain all of this, its art. good shit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-13,13320 love the botw memory tune oml it fits it so well
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"i swear i've played through the game ten times, and only knew five minutes of lore from this nine hour video."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"i knew this video was going to be amazing, but then i heard the kingdom two crowns ost in the background which was chefs kiss"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-03,"thanks, mate, youll be getting me through a whole shift at work  thank you for all the hard work!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-18,"going in to elden ring lore as a tes fan is so wild. elden ring heres how colour relates to the lore and our understanding of the universe !  elder scrolls go here world without wheel, charting zero deaths, and echoes singing, seht said, until all of it was done, and in the centre was anything whatever. and the red moment became a great howling unchecked, for the provisional house was in ruin. and vivec became glass, a lamp, for the dragons mane had broke, and the red moon bade him come."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,this video has been absolutely amazing for having to play in the background while i farm for runes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,ive been going to bed watching to this video for like a week now and still got hours to go
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-06,one more video before bed.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,i have searched for the lore and got videos with partial lore in them but after seeing the length of this one bro all i can say is dammmmmmmm.......................................................
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,"do you guys think there is a link between birth consummation and great runes? i just did fias quest and it finally struck me that she claims that lying with godwyn will allow her to birth a child, a great rune. so what does this mean in regard to runes and the demi god children? like i cant see the connection between these words miyazaki picked for this dialogue but it has to mean something. just a thought. great vid! hawkshaw"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,something to keep me entertained during this hurricane
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,20830 oh my god gothic 2 music! this is my childhood thank you for reminding me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-23,"man knows what were here for,  videos for long workdays or to sleep to"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,"as i know the full content of this video before even watching 2 minutes it like! love your work, love your creativity and research! please keep doing what you guys are doing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"you deserve way more views and subs, i cant imagine how long this took"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,finally! the full story from a source i trust. my lore hunting ends today!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"13900 i think here it is interesting to mention that besides old being able to be broken down by yellow, it holds it in place. gold is basically a more subdued color of yellow. if bright yellow bordering with orange is for chaos, unchained and unrestricted thing, gold in elden ring represents order. but given this color theory, order is basically a subdued chaos."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,thank you for the video. i love how at 4944 you can hear the music from the goron city in ocarina of time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"this is literally the most epic game ever made no doubt, miyazaki literally made something almost impossible in every aspect , no other game makes you feel that way ,it's pure art and i know i'm glazing but i've been playing games for 30 years and this is it ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-06,everytime i pause the video i have to start it over
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,just chillin listening playing the game. sweet
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,wow you really went deep with this my dude. thank you! i absolutely adore from games and their lore
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,"20311, thanks for the clarification, i was unaware of the importance of fowls in boggarts character arc"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,i slept and woke up and this video was still running. well played.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-17,"there is a theory about that of radahn vs morgot in 33833, where that is not morgot defeating radahn, but rather a metaphor of morgot's forces defeating radahn. morgot and melania both knew that they wouldnt be able to defeat radahn. he was simply too strong of a fighter, and a clever one that that too. also, from what i seen from in game and sources of lore searching, i don't think radahn is greedy for power, but rather greedy for a fight. everyone of his key soldiers mentions that radahn is someone who iches for a fight, and that he is super honorable. he wants to fight so much to the point where je summons estals as a mini fight for him  which makes radahn stronger each time too."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,how many times will i watch this? or perhaps sleep to this. or read a book. i dunno what i do know is atleast 4 times. and more into the future. many many thanks for the time and effort.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,i watch this during work
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,oh god im gonna be sleeping to this for weeks trying to remember the last part i remember
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,holy shit u werent kidding in that thumb nail. we are on color theory 15 minutes in and still on red. great videorealizationsobservations.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,im glad your included the dlc in this
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,"awesome video, i will wait for the entire dlc lore too"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,i never knew that there was this much lore to the perfumers. god dayum.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,"such a cool video, being someone who studied colors for a period of time the intro is so well designed!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-03,i've never played this game but im crying over boggarts fate
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"not me struggling to fall asleep, and this video showing on my feed"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,i struggle to sleep in silence.... so this is very pleasant
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,"another thing to note about godfrey in his second phase is that he too roars. there's little gameplay loop reason for this, so it's aesthetic and thematic, and it's really neat and my favorite roar animation in the game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,wasnt expecting to recognize mischievous alchemy at 21340
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,put this video on to fall asleep to and he was still talking about colours when i woke up 9.3 hours out of 24
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-13,haven't even watched it yet but liked  subbed for the 9 hour playtime. we will sleep well this night
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,you're telling me fire is red? miazaki you've done it again
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,ayo what the hell 9 hours? no way this video most also has a in depth explanation of every characters story including even the random npcs or animals
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,ok the now clear fact that those giant bolts in the ground in leyndell were actually giant perfumedispersing bombs basically just blew my freakin mind. ive wondered what they could be for a long time.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"love the video so far but i have to comment on how you describe chaos chaos is not simply unpredictable. it follows its own rules that are impossible to understand within the framework of reality. it's not pure randomness. you see this in everything yellow in elden ring, too it's not just randomness, it's a living or rather unliving force within nature, the perfect unison of neutrality and extremism. it is always to some degree unpredictable but the risk of using something chaos driven is always predictable. this is how you work chaos you abandon the concept of singular truth and look at it all as a web of possibilities and in that, chaos is a very willful, driven force, clearly following rules and even an agenda, it's just impossible to us to understand that hence most people think that chaos is just randomness because that is easier for them to imagine."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"keeping me from going hollow, thanks as always hawkshaw"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,elden ring was the most amazing rpg ive ever played. my first time playing it my friend already started and i just wanted to help where he was at but he pushed me to create my own profile played for 20 hours straight then went home and bought the game restarted and played to completion within two months
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,9 hours bro... congratulations seriously.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-09,a true hero of our time thanks so much for this epic lore video !!! the game keeps getting better the more you understand about itself
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,"this is fantastic. well done, sir"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"i feel like the crucible was a network of roots that spread throughout the land. and at its center was a stump, that stump was the elden ring its primordial form and whatever was thrown in would create new life based on what was put in. when marika rose to godhood, the erdtree was sprouted from that stump using all the energy the crucible had to offer."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"alright john elden ring, ill gladly donate 9hrs of my day"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,im so in love with the zelda music at 5055 omg
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"perfect, just what i was looking for!  what? i have a reading assessment? how long is it as an audiobook?  20 hours?! fine elen ring will have to wait. but i'll be back."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"beautiful video. very thought out, intelligently written."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,you know brother getting paiiiiid for this gotta love it and much respect for this
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,i saw the thumbnail and im like oh must be a pretty long video if he said it like that looks at the corner of the thumbnail ten hours
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-23,i love the background music but i've got to say hearing age of myth music is surprisingly distracting. great video
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-10,"i think there is still more to dominula we've yet to uncover. it appears to have the same aesthetic as the shaman villages. additionally, the festive grease grants runes upon attacks just like the celebrant weapons, and seems uncannily related to the actions of dominula. the bonny village, too, has a snake skin. adding to your analogy of the skinning ritual."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,finally finished the game got the age of stars ending and now i can finally watch this. let us go.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,awesome video and awesome channel
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i'd like to note that there are very agile lions with horns in the base game that sometimes can breath out ice, and people really seem to not link them with the divine beast for some reason."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"918 it's not just that he roars like a bear his whole barehanded fighting style is very similar to the bear moveset. like the bear hug attack, the swipes, or the ground pound attack."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"052 a spiral, that would pierce the heavens. row row, fight the powah!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i swear godfrey just becomes cooler and cooler. hes so much more ingrained in the worlds history and influence than most people think. hes literally arthurian legend. i remember before the release of the game, miyazaki talked about godfrey. about how hes like this mythical legend, this prophetic lord, and someone the lands look up to, as well as having his own culture and history prior to his legend. shadow of the erdtree really nailed these details about godfrey even more"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,it's 300 am and i'm in the middle of the jungle watching a vaativydia video.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"one thing that i find very neat about elden ring is romina specifically, because within the lore of the game she is probably one of the most divine looking bosses in the game. she has scorpions and butterflies, which are symbols from rot worship, centipedes which are frequently found at divine sites in the main game, and her scorpion half and centipede half spiral together into her main body."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,hornsent i am the drill that will pierce the heavens marika and messmer nuuh
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"it is so fascinating to see how much of the hornsent culture wound up being integrated into marika's divine age of the erdtree. no matter how much she hated them for what they did to her people, or how much the chaotic crucible warred with her idea of perfect order, she couldn't help but remember their practices as part of her upbringing. really reflects on how empires in the real world retain aspects of those they have conquered. fromsoft are in a class of their own when it comes to fictional word building and history."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,goes to bed  elden ring lore vid drops  a w o k e n
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"you are completely right that the lamenter has ties to the frenzied flame. i mentioned in my post keratin theory that ascension via suffering is tied to the weeping peninsula, where we find the callu baptismal church. callu in reference to calluses, the numbness that occurs after pain, baptismal in reference to the ascension via this numbness. in that church we find the incantation flame of frenzy. which i've never been able to wrap my head around until you brought this up!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"two thoughts on what the lamenter could have witnessed perhaps the lamenter harkens to trina's words, how divinity and godhood is a cage, they saw that truth and the hornsent refused to accept it or perhaps that in the randomness of the divine crucible, they understood that the hornsent were nothing special in the grand scheme of things"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"the way horah holds his hands open, wide, and arced, as that would be the way you'd guard from something 3x your size"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"it's crazy how much lore implications the dlc added, but also added just as many questions lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,marika honey youre erdtree sap intolerant!! godfreyi just tolerate it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,i simply want to become a bear.  red bear so relatable. i have not related with any fictional character in my entire life before i met this guy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,fun fact! messmer stuffing the hornsent in the furnace golems was his clapback to the hornsent stuffing marikas people in jars. really made em reap what they sowed with that one.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,the idea of godfrey fighting bears in his youth is just badass
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i want to offer up the idea that the scadurtree and the erdtree were the large twisted trees that inspired the hornsent. marika used her godly power to remove the erdtree from it's twisted partner, to untangle herself from the hornsent. the golden facsimile of the erdtree could be hiding or even containing the twisted from of the lighter tree."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i do think there was a general disdain among the hornsent for those who didn't have horns. in belurat, there are slave enemies whose distinct characteristics are chains around their necks and the fact they don't have horns. considering the fact that horns were physical evidence of divine heritage and blessing, and leda's comments that the hornsent were no different from any other ruling people in their want to conquer and subjugate which is in line with er's themes, i do think this checks out. i'd sooner say people like midra and hoarah loux were exceptions rather than the rule. plus, it could be that the highlanders were also imitating the old warrior, rather than their leader himself being the guy. according to the item description, it's implied that the warrior was from older times from the horned warriors' perspective as well, while hoarah loux was from around the time of the end of hornsent rule. also, would hoarah loux have had crucible knights prior to the establishment of the golden order? knights are associated with a sense of embellishment and order, the former of which hoarah loux's people shunned, while the latter the crucible people looked down on. not to mention there isn't a single 'knight' enemy or character from the hornsent or rauh areas. to tie it to real world history, knighthood came to being in christian europe, which the golden order mirrors and is the equivalent of in er's world history. the crucible knights were quite possibly highlanders, though. kinda of a tangent, but what's interesting about the gate of divinity is the fact that it's fleshy and visibly drenched in blood in the story trailer, but dry and ashen white in the game. it's possible that it means the gate was made then and there during marika's ascension, maybe even by marika herself considering that all the corpses are hornsent. power comes from death in elden ring, and since she had the intent of becoming a god under the guidance of the two fingers, it'd make sense, even if there might've been something already there as a base. it would also be an additional reason for marika to keep it secret."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"one thing that i'm not finding any lore channels commenting on is the connection between the windmill villages and the itako shamans. i believe the women of the windmill villages are either descended from the itako shaman, or they are them. both are clearly numen. their societies are seemingly all female, their architecture is almost a 11 and built atop hills, they all have their braided the same way marika does with the left braid cut off. their villages are even both obsessed with growing flowers. both of them are blind. isn't it strange how the women of the windmill villages seem to not be bothered by your presence at all until interact you with them in any way? you can walk right up to them, but if you do anything to alert them they immediately aggro you. the blue festive garb states that young maidens are central to the festival. this is speculation, but wouldn't it make sense for the numen to value youth, given that they are seldom born? additionally, the festive grease states that the delightful festival is an old tradition one old enough for the erdtree to tacitly tolerate its endurance. the grease gives you the same rune gain hit on effect as the celebrants do, so it must be referencing their festival specifically. the grease can only be made with knot resin and blessed bone shards, which can only be found in the land of shadows. from this, we can imply that the weapons of the celebrants originate from the land of shadow, as does their festival and culture. even the inquisitor clothing is reminiscent of the festive garbs and their attacks seem to fire rune arcs. an interesting parallel between the shamans and the horsent is that while the hornsent seem to value flesh, the shamans seem to value bone. the rib rake, cleaver and sickle are all crafted from bone and aren't described as weapons, but ritual tools that would be very useful for ritual butchery. the cleaver would be useful for breaking bodies down, the rib rake would be useful for skinning and the sickle would be useful for carving musclefat off of bones. it makes sense that they would ally themselves with a god skin apostle, because they need to get rid of the skin to access bone, but they don't necessarily value it. after all, none of their items, clothes or consumables use it whereas practically all of the celebrantshaman equipment and consumables use bones."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"the hornsent lore was my favourite thing in the expansion  as it gave me more answers into some intrinsic basegame questions, especially relating to the crucible and those that marika deemed taboo or omen in modern times. it fully fleshed out ideas and cultures that were hinted at, and played with, in the basegame and gave the world a whole new dynamic context to its timeline and history. the hornsent to the dlc was what marika was to the basegame, especially with how their dna is utilised as influence throughout their respective realms. .and i love the crucible lore. and as it seems, thats the central core of worldbuilding from which the realm of shadow is built. love the crucible stuff. im a happy lad"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"not a big deal but i just noticed, the stormhawk king has horns. it's really tricky to spot them because of the feathers. but he has two horns on the left side of his head, sticking up and back as the two highest points off his head. i thought they were feathers all this time but when you look at the rendering, those horns have the line pattern associated with omen like horns."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"the stone sheathed sword give us a big clue about divinity orderlight is symboliced by perfectly straight lines and disordershadow by random curves. what do we get when we fuse both? the spiral, the divine duality and balance between chaos and order, curved lines in an ordered pattern. in belurat we can find tablets depicting perfectly spiral shaped trees, maybe that is what they aspired for. what we got was the scaduutree a perfectly straight trunk with life giving sap ,depicting life and light, enveloped by a twisted, curved tree, depicting shadow. in the end, divine valance was never achieved and light was separated from shadow as the realms would latter be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"just a thing i like to remind people of when talking scadu tree the sealingtree is the second coil around the scadu tree's straight trunk albeit tilted to the left which is bleeding golden sap. the sealing tree is that second trunk and the veil itself. the scadu tree therefore, or rather the dark manifastation of the erdtree of things not orderly, is just one straight trunk, just with black bark."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,the level of detail in this game will never cease to amaze me man
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i absolutely loved the hornsent lore and the consequential ties to marika's pastpresent and messmers crusade. they just fit into to world like they were always there because they were and learning about their culture and history was immensely satisfying for me. additional, belurat and the tower is one of my favourite areas. the architectute and visual design is so detailed, beautiful and characterful. so much individuality and the music of belurat is also divine. also the veil over the top and climbing above the clouds in enir ilim was so breathtaking. the lore they added just hits so hard and is so integral to the overall story. their history with marika and messmer's character were my favourite parts of the dlc lore probably. though much of it was great and miquella's story with all it's philosophy and exploring moralityjustice is fantastic too. bayle, metyr, midra and the shadowlands sorrowful plight too. sounds like i'm rattling off the whole thing but i didnt want to inadvertently bash the other great aspects of the lore. tldr thanks for the video, vaati, and everyone else involved. i'm a big fan of the lore and videos like these are real treats."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i would like to know more about the connection of divine invocation to marika's ascention. the horned warriors invoke a divine beast and become the vessel for it. and you could argue marika did the same in her ascention. that divine beast just happened to also be the elden beast. i think she didn't just perform the secret right laid out in the scroll. she used the divine gateway to also invoke the elden beast. knowledge that was unknown to the hornsent, and given to marika by the fingers. that's my theory anyway"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i was left wanting more after you mentioned the cycle of revenge between marika and the hornsent. to me this cycle is the original sin that miquella tried to erase with his age of compassion and from where many curses originated like the omen curse, the reawakening of scarlet rot, the fly sickness, and the base serpent."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"i feel like marika definitely had a hand in the creation of the gate of divinity. not only is it fresh when she ascended to god hood, but there's also the description for the healing spell she cast at the shaman village despite 'knowing there was no one left to heal'. the shamans were abused by the hornsent, but all of them being eradicated at once doesn't really got into the hornsent customs. they were treated as a resource  no shamans, no jars  it wouldn't have made sense to use them up when their numbers replenish over time. that line could also imply that marika was partially responsible. if the shamans were needed to construct the gate, she may have sanctioned the death of her entire people to create it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,marikas betrayal with seduction in the dlc trailer makes sense now! she betrayed the hornsent by seducing godfrey to her side. i never thought that godfrey was known and revered by hornsent but it makes sense
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"one of the biggest mysteries is why queen marika, who was chosen by the greater will, would break the elden ring in the first place. here's a theory marika actually wanted to free the lands between from the greater will. the greater will, an outer god, uses the elden ring as a tool to enforce its rule over the lands between. marika may have realized that this order was actually a form of oppression, trapping the people in a cycle of suffering and stagnation. her act of shattering the elden ring might have been a desperate attempt to break free from this divine control. the fact that she hid miquella away and he later sought his own path suggests that she may have wanted a different future than what the greater will intended."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"my head canon theory is that radagon was not always a part of marika. maybe he was a sinner due to his red hair being correlative to the giants and possibly then committed to the same process as other shamans and through their successful merging, uplifting marika and him to the status of saint."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"something i think worth positing is that it seems very likely to me that godfrey was a separate person from hoarax loux prior to his lordship, and that his body was the vessel for hoarah loux's soul, just as mohg's was the vessel for radahn's. in both promised consort radahn and godfrey's boss fights, the souls that inhabit them only fully take over when they are faced with sufficient opposition. while it could be argued that hoarah loux is only able to emerge because of serosh's execution, i think it's also very possible that he kills serosh because he is rebecoming hoarah loux, who would likely resent being tamed by a beast. lastly, godfrey's mannerisms, speech, and fighting style are just so distinct from hoarah loux's the armor that he disdains and the wildness with which he fights that it really beggars belief to think that godfrey is simply a renamed and seroshbound hoarah loux."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,"radagon explicitly resented his red hair for being recognized as a curse mark of the fell god, giants red braid whip description text says so. it also says he is a giant, but that would explain why messmer is cursed by a fire serpent and why he has red hair and is so large."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"the hornsent definitely did not want marika to achieve godhood, the ritual of ascension of the gate of divinity requires a pair, for miquella it required a pair, enir illim is covered in statues showing a pair beautiful shot of them at 4617, the dlc trailer speaks of a seduction and betrayal and why on gods earth would the hornsen torture marikas people and then make one of these people their god? lets speedrun getting wiped out by a scornful goddess beach! cannot have been the goal of the hornsent! marika clearly overtook the ritual and conspired against the chosen god of the hornsent. with miquella and radahn, they seemingly became 1 body. where have we heard of that before??? only 1 dude comes to mind that is connected to the crucible directly and that lives in marika rent free while not being considered a god radagon."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-30,"has anyone else noticed, that even though the fire giant looks like it's alive if you look at his face, he's literally a corpse being controlled by the fire god there's not a whole lot of evidence in other parts of the game, but when you look at his eyes compared to other giants they're not quite the same, they're much more dead and reminiscent of the death blighted creatures and godwin's corpse"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-23,"great outcome for a bad situation, rob is him. strickland and rob makes heaps of sense, i would love to see rob fight for the title though"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-02,"something to consider about the accuracy between adventure and sandbox modes, in sandbox, you're not really moving, which means you have high stability, while in adventure, youre moving a lot, so you're stability is lower, this increasing inaccuracy. on that note, it may be useful to enable the stability info for the gui, as that will give you easy to see, real time info of how accurate your shots will be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-16,modding elden ring should be an elden sin.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-16,give this man the dlc!

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"today i'm nohitting all bosses from ds123, sekiro, bloodborne and elden ring in a row playing blind and using fists. it took me thousands of hours of planning and whilst it is probably one of my greatest runs so far, i'm looking forward to doing it again with demon souls too next week since i forgot to include it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,i watch elden ring related content regularly but the effort and level of performance you put into your runs is outstanding and your professionalism is admirable
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"you said something about the age of your viewers. in my case youre dead on. im 47, have a great job but not enough time to play elden ring much so having your videos going in the background allows me to get things done, or work, and still connect with elden ring. thanks for the great content!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,yeah. this is definitely not normal or within human capabilities. insane.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"lmao, deploying the light of miquella for soldier of godrick is sending me. it's just an ordinary dude, you've got so much stealth he doesn't even know you're there, and you're hitting him with a fucking orbital laser."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"finally, thank you hunter for bringing this to us, this run was sick, shame i missed the end as it was late where i was, but an amazing achievement by gino, looking forward to all bosses true level 1!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,incredible!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"the editing in this video is phenomenal, the boss graphic on the side of the screen is such a good touch"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,casually watching this vid while its unlisted? didnt think that was possible
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,3000 ive been watching you throughout my teenage years and i love the long content! its good to watch while i eat
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"been seeing the attempts appear on my feed but i've been holding off watching until i get the dlc. will be coming back to watch once i complete it myself my 37582014 hit run. good work man, absolute legend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"you simply cannot be stopped. rick, consort of miquella cowers in fear over whispers of your name"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,epic to say the least. you really are a beast! the focus needed for this... can't really describe myself.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"this video its not only one of the greatest ginnos works, its also an amazing work from the editor. both made a great job so we can enjoy this master piece."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,loved watching the routing and seeing how specific stuff gets. ggs
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"insane levels of preparation, memorization, skill, dedication, and practice to pull this off. well done!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,024 if you like runs like this one dude there is no run like this one
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,1424  give millicent canadian 'healthcare' omfg rofl

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"its my honor to be part of this run when it was happening live. honestly gino is undoubtedly best elden ring player i have seen. congrats my goat, ggs"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-11,i subbed from the title alone i love seeing skill. this was one of the best long videos i have ever watched in youtube. holy shit i got inspired.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-13,"good morning boys, ur phones flat too 35409"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-15,"you were my top guy on the youtube wrapped thing, i love ginomachino"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,surely there will be a main channel video of the first playthrough of the dlc surely 4945
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,the lamenter noise will haunt me for the rest of my life after how much i've heard it on streamthis video
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"my stepdad got super into elden ring and ran across your vids organically, i wouldn't say he's around the retired agerange but he's getting close. sometimes i'll find him just chilling in his chair with some food and watching one of your hourslong videos. i'd say the filters working, lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"gino felicidades por este nuevo logro! , tu forma de juego es realmente admirable, me inspiras a jugar este tipo de juegos, saludos desde per."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"33630 small stuff like this make all the difference, thank you for whoever took the time to edit this together"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,12830 i can't believe rain of fire is a real gino strat in 2024
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,"wow, what a run. the dedication and focus required is very impressive. having just played through the entire game and dlc after a year long break, it was very interesting to hear your thoughts on the balancing and game design. i fully sympathise with your gripes and boss design, it goes entirely against your play style, and to some degree, against the design of previous fromsoft bosses. that being said, i personally love the way they approached balancing. i''ve played all souls titles and enjoyed them immensly, but eldenring especially reminded me that i'm first and foremost an rpg player through and through. i've always approached challanges in these games by using everything in my tool kit, half the fun for me is in trying out different spells, items and summons. probably cause i suck and learning patters and staying focused for long periods of time. however, using all your tools well completely trivializes entire sections of the game. and holding myself back to make it more balanced is not very fun for me. this is why i rejoiced when the dlc basically expected me to summon, when it made me gather fragments and resistance items before facing the new bosses. that is what i'm good at, that is what i love about this game. figuring out the right spirit ash, damage type and resistanceutility items is by far the most satisfying thing in the entire game for me and the dlc being balanced around doing just that is perfect in that case. 3 months late, most likely no one will read this comment, but i really wanted to share my perspective on eldenrings game design haha."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"funny how as soon as the controller switched, you got the run"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,love how gino puts marker on a boss that it'll gonna be long fight and then just destroys him in 5 seconds
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-10,"wow man, just wow. that's a lot of dedication, also i am learning so much from your videos. you find so easy way to fight boss and you are the best to me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"love the new boss sidebar thing, really cool! and gg on the bosses!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"not only was the challenge amazing to watch but this editing is top tier too, awesome video all around"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,my toxic trait is watching these things and then playing like i can do this only to be completely humbled haha
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-13,"hallo gino, sie sind fr mich der beste elden ring spieler berhaupt.  ich bin wie immer beeindruckt!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,was so much fun to watch live! ggs
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-09,"i'm about to destroy my ego and self respect for 3 hours watching this but totally deserved this. well done my guy, that's insane."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,just simply learn and then win ginomachino
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,i love all the editing put into these videos. all the little details about boss difficulty and length is a nice touch.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,was a pleasure to see this live
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,great job! once again proving why you're one of the best hitless players of all time in souls.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"your discussion about how people might think you dislike the game when highlighting points you don't like, to me that is how passion can be expressed. if we're truly invested into a game, after a certain point the glaring things we see are the problems we perceive with it that passion we have wants the worst bits removed, to make the game that bit closer to perfect. p.s. i also agree that ds3 bosses are better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"incredible works gino, gg! some of those catacombs were really spooky to navigate props to editor for editing this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-31,i had this on in the background working and im very involved in the dbd community so hearing otzdarva at 3311 sent me in a spiral for like 5 minutes
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-15,i got my youtube recap i was in your 0.5 viewer 14x more than anyone else crazy how much ive watched your streams and videos thank you for all your streams and dedication to keep everyone happy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"my favourite thing about this entire run is that light of miquella, a spell where you summon the power of the last boss of the dlc which is generally considered the hardest soulslike boss, is used mainly for clearing corners and killing mildly annoying enemies  poor imp in the corner?  nuke him skeleton at the end of a tight hallway?  ac130 above a little guy on the floor below you?  disintegrate him snail trying to hide?  level the building"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,"just wanted to say, the editing on this is insane once again. i applaud you editors."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"so many unlucky issues,he had to eswap to a different controller"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"fabulous work, both on completing the run and to the editor! love the upcoming boss display"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"214 nihgah, i be queef"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"man i just finished the 207 boss no death randomizer and im blessed with this??? shoutout gino, and someone check on hunter"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,23146 my heart dropped although i know that this is the run!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,this video scratches the right part of brain. thanks for the goodygood chemicals gino.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"somebody's probably already said, but that tower at 4926i think is behind gaius, where the big bowl with 5 scadutree fragments is. i'm not sure but i think it is"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,absolutely insane. cant wait to watch this!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,no ggs in chat after gilika... utter madness!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,absolutely incredible gino
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,2948 . and then there's me a 14 years old italian teenager who has nothing else to do
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,holy shit he did it again but better
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,"hunter with god editing as always, gino just so clean and humble"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,insane. i literally just thought i haven't seen a gino vid in a while and searched him and found this brand new video. the elden ring gods pinged me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,i could listen to this guy for hours and i will
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-15,did anyone else wake up to this?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,i was there when u were routing and getting hit by hippo and the death knight u overcame every obstacle and did this insane run gahdamnn big w gino
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,2900 yea you probably right. teenagers' attention span has been ruined by social media
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-01,oh my lord congratulations gino!!!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,every did a madness only run?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-13,i've seen so many of your videos and i realized i never subscribed. so i fixed that for you man. you earned this sub!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"you know how they could make elden ring better? it's pretty simple, just make a new ending where there are no thorns blocking your way and you become the elden lord after defeating morgott."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"absolutely insane dude, ggs to this incredible piece of art!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"a true nohit should be without magic. i don't claim that it's easy, or even possible, but that was the rule for a valid run on ds1ds2ds3  one exception was made for ds2, and it was the bow , and that should obviously be the case on elden ring too. oneshot every bosses makes the run pointless. nonetheless gg."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-15,dude! impressed does not begin to describe what i feel! there is nothing this man can not achieve in souls if he is given a bit of time and some attempts souls perfected
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,the editing hunter puts in these videos is truly insane
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,gg gino didnt get to catch it live but im glad i got to witness this level of dedication
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"im 18 years old and i love watching your videos, its so calm and chill. keep it up !!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,this was so entertaining to watch from day one to completion. i was probably way more excited than gino when he got the run. lets go!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"dude, almost at 500k subs! well deserved for both you and hunter. teargasjazz"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,absolutely love the new boss difficulty status interface. super clean and engaging
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"congrats, gino! also, the editing on this video is fantastic!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,"god run, no hit, all bosses in all games  dlcs would be insane"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,best repellant torch my beloved. its just so nice to not need to worry about dogwolfratbasilisk ambushes
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,gino uploaded!! i know what im doing with the rest of my sunday
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,"you are an absolute mad lad, gino!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,you did it! awesome run! good work!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-20,i fell asleep watching a video and apparently this video started playing for about 3 hours before my phone shut down. now i will actually watch it from the start
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-03,videos edited really well this format is great
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,amazing run gino gg! and also kudos to the editor. edited as great as the run itself.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-21,this is such an insane accomplishment
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-28,wow. that run is... just insane! congrats!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,the great one never ceases to amaze us. congratulations
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,love the danger rankings
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"the best er streamer, hands down. congratulations, this was so small feat!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,lord almighty gino this was a journey. thank you and thank hunter.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,i love how you always have the ambient background music of oblivion in your runs
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-27,"this is going to be an insane video. lets go, gino"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"thanks for summoning me lud, the legend of shady and shiro is one ill cherish forever."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,that guy that said 698 deaths lud said no youre just hopeful but he was only 3 off
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-12,ludwig yelling no hit run baby! only to then get jawed by a book is one of the funniest things ever
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-23,"i like how him and some of the other streamers were so focused on levels, your weapon level is what it does. 1 makes a boss go from hard to easy sometimes"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,optional bosses? not on my agenda he says as he runs away from the boss gate keeping the the last half of the game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"4444 lud i'm out of pots, boys shady  shiro charge headfirst into the boss without question those brave souls really know how to protect their mogul. ludwig7"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"i love how chat was giving him shit about killing patches for a while after. those were patches' pets, getting revenge. and dead, like patches hahahaha"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-08,"i feel bad in hindsight knowing ludwig suffered through the twin gargoyles to get a grind spot for 3000 a run when he got have gone to varre in liurnia, crushed 5 finger items, and then teleported straight to mogwyn palace where he'd just have to climb up the cliff, get the grace at the top and then you have nice easy run that between the suicide bird you can snipe and all the guys sleeping on the cliff you can get like 20,000 to 40,000 souls. if only he knew. having said all that, shit's hilarious."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"i think we should stop slavery ludwig, 2022. finally someone brave enough to say it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,lud calmly we did it boys heartrate at 140
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,i forgot the monologue about lud insisting that the government isnt doing enough to fix potholes. inspirational gameplay commentary
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-22,"bro this shit had me rolling! i havent played elden in at least a year but youve got me wanting to play again. 110 hours for me to beat it and i really rushed the end. didnt explore the capitol, just busted ass towards the end."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,the thing i learned the most during this video is that my heart rate is absolutely fucked compared to lud's. never seen such low numbers lol.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,you know its getting serious when you start having a conversation with the boss youre fighting
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-23,"i gotta say, margit does a great job of making sure you can play the game before you plunge too deep"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-20,i never have to beat him again! ludwig 2022. two years later the hardest boss in any souls like happens to be radahn.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"your parents named you margit?!? ironically, he named himself margit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,i love the fact he didnt even include the fire giant. that was one of the darkest times for lud i think
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"thank god there was a blessed champion who saved all this footage. ludwig7 to you, sir."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-13,pointcrows goldfish did better than ludwig
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"margit, the fell  49 deaths  94 deaths 45 3 for second fight lol godrick, the grafted  117 deaths  158 deaths 41 ancestor spirit  209 deaths  209 deaths 0 red wolf of radagon  213 deaths  217 deaths 4 rennala, queen of the full moon  218 deaths  230 deaths  12 draconic tree sentinel  287289 unshown starscourge radahn  296 deaths  365 deaths 69 valiant gargoyle  375 deaths  479 deaths 104! godskin duo  535 deaths  549 deaths 14 lol beast clergyman  559 deaths  569 deaths 10 sir gideon ofnir  569 deaths  577 deaths 8 godfrey  577 deaths  623 deaths 46 radagonelden 625 deaths  662 to elden 701 deaths 76 most deaths to boss  valiant gargoyle 104 deaths least deaths to boss  ancestor spirit 0 deaths"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,him beating the third demi god like that felt like a movie scene. guess its gotta be fuckin me and takes him down with the final blow.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"my favorite part, 3442  3520, sleepdeprived ludwig yells at the developers not understanding you are supposed to use great runes before battle, not in the heat it and deletes 5 from his inventory one of the most valuable items in the game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-29,that radahn yell of victory  i love these games for that feeling! but the frustration of getting there is painful haha
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,the calmest of ggs at the end while his heart rate is literally 140
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-07,"runs past all the enemies and dungeons, wonders why he is so underleveled."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-12,i love how he constantly panic rolls and then blames the game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,1808 the summon in the backround shooting the wall im dying xd
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-04,1009 i died laughing when he said i got hit by a cutscene the same happened to me my first time
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-03,ludwig feeling bad for killing patches and the chat just rubbing it in after that was the best
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,i love how lud could have beaten this game so much faster if he actually explored places to find the blood draining stuff
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-30,lud saying we beat him to radahn and we never have to do it again is so ironic after dlc lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"i long for lud to just, whether or not it is recorded, take his time exploring all of the game he rushed through to beat. there is so much for him in there that i think hell love, and he never got to experience most of it through this stream. amazing video, watching the rune arc discard was incredibly painful!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,seeing lud discard almost all of his rune arcs fucking hurt me to my core lmao damn i really said great runes smh
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"the game is much more fun when you don't rush through it and skip all the other content beside what's needed to beat the game. i do hope you come back to it lud, even if you don't stream it and just play it by yourself. hard but fun game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-24,3129 we beat him and we never have to do it again! ....
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-08,lud assumes patches is an enemy in seconds also lud are these lightning balls freindly?
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,"i felt it when he beat margit. i had the same exact experience, fighting him underleveled and not even knowing what summons were. probably the most rewarding win in the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"ludwig discarding his ruin arcs was absolutely hilarious, those single handily helped me beat rahdan"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,3130 lets goo! we beat him and we never have to do it again! the foreshadowing for consort radahn goes crazy
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"i watched a lot of the subathon and never saw him crack, 3 or 4 days into elden ring he flat out yells at dennis, malds intensely, and goes into jokergoblin mode. honestly, it was so entertaining to watch live, thank you for sacrificing your sanity, gamer lud."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-26,it's cool to watch a player go from bumbling noob to seasoned killer. everyone is capable of beating these games. you just gotta keep fighting my fellow tarnished.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"the last fight was so amazing to watch. you could see that in his last try, everything clicked. he was perfectly timing his dodges and counters. he didn't looked panicked or stressed. just focus and being at one with his character. perfect ending."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-10,why did he skip the entire leyndell capital and fire giant fight
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"that was an extremely poetic rahdan kill, huge props for that"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"am i the only one that was moved by the very last fight? he knew the mechanics, he knew he had it, his whole attitude and face changed. he suddenly realized how much he loved the game. as the fight ended, he just had this smile on his face as his heart rate jumped higher than any previous point. that's why these games are so god damn addicting!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"2800 no wonder its called festival of radhan, because were celebrating his fcking victory im so dead"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-01,705 how march time is left? lud like one boss left
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-03,man i felt my soul leave when he discarded the rune arcs and said they're useless
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-19,3500 runes orgasms imagine him discovering the suicide crow in mohg's palace.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"3741 well, pretty close the actual final death count! i watched a decent amount of this when he was live. but watching ludwigs progression of rolling into attacks compared to the very beginning, is pretty kewl ggs also poor patches"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-31,chat so wrong for not telling him about fias prank hug!!  and the way he defeats radahn is pure comedy
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-01,seeing ludwigs anger at rune arcs before seeing how good they are killed me
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"would've loved to see him fight malenia and some of the other other bosses, there are some crazy ones"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-13,its amazing how ludwig can make this game look even harder than it actually is
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-16,"2909 the fact that he made up a story about himself beating radahn and calling him the hardest boss, just hilarious. malenia this guys got no chance. mogh yeah hes terrible."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-18,can u imagine how hard it is to condense over 60 hours of content into one hour
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"rune arcs activate the ability of whatever great rune you have equipped, it lasts till you die, your supposed to activate it before the fight, not during. i died inside watching him discard all of those, i'm constantly wishing i had more"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-06,lud literally skipping all the good gear also lud wonders why he's so w e a k
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-06,an elden ring boss fight with the one piece soundtrack behind it is something i didnt know i needed
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-29,"you killing patches when he begs for his life is probably the funniest shit i've ever seen, thank you for that lmfao"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,is that a dragon? i wonder who he's trying to fight killed me
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-12,"im too prideful for elden ring, instead of ignoring enemies and going through i fight every single one until nothing is left"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-21,526  iii ahhh... ii'd ahhhh ludwig
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-26,you know ludwig is tired as hell when he keeps calling elden ring elden scrolls
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,this will never amount to the feeling of being there through the entire gargoyle fight. being there when he finally beat it literally made me get up and scream and tell my friend who had been watching earlier.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"2037 still the best comedic timing from the whole stream, i was laughing my ass off when watched it on the stream"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-20,him dropping all his rune arcs just too funny lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,great video as always lud! too bad patches wasn't here to see it with us.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"very glad to see you were able to make a video out of it! excited to watch tomorrow, but i figured id comment my excitement now! i caught lots of the stream but you already know im gonna love rewatching the highlights"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"the shady shiro fight, the last hit on radahn, the final smile at the end with elden beast. what a journey. o7"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-07,5227 hardest boss in the game malenia
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"i think what is great about games like these, is that its not just beating a game its feels more like you were able to conquer it. going through trial and error and learning from your mistakes. im glad you beat it and i hope you play again and take your time with it!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-21,i genuinly think i have beaten 50 of the game. i laughed so hard at that. imagine if he would have known whats to come.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,youre not a real one unless you sat through hours of lud grinding giants
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-18,i died when the berserk music started playing during shady and shiro's fight lmaooo
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,i love how lud was dogshit the entire game then popped off at elden beast and played it clean as fuck
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-30,ludwig narrarating himself as the best elden ring player also ludwig what the hell is a rune arc! there cant be a more useless itsm
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-27,i've watched alot of souls vids over the years but lud is the first i've heard call a boss a cringe try hard
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-18,5335 saying 'jesus christ' and immediately getting crucified is crazy
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-14,2245 is that a dragon!? i wonder who he's trying to fight absolutely killed me
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-29,"i know it's been a year, but watching this makes me feel so much better about my play through."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,this video was fire. good job to the editors that managed to peace this whole thing together cohesively after the vod was deleted . also 69 deaths on radahn nice
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-03,im assuming theres only one more boss left after killing margit is the best line
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-18,"watching that last fight was so satisfying. it was so clear how much you improved and how hard you worked to get there. and it was such a good run too, your movement was so fluid. amazing job lud! and shoutout mods 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"whoever edits these videos needs a goddamn raise, i was dying laughing the whole time although i'm sure ludwig pays them well"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,thank you youtube for restoring the vods. massive props. great content! didn't watch when you were streaming because i didn't want to get spoiled. just finished the game today and you uploaded this at the perfect time!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-22,in the godfrey fight this makes me think this is what big nate feels like when going through mrs godfrey's class
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-09,that summoning salt reference as he was facing radahnn was absolutely amazing
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-03,"my favorite part was the ancestral follower shooting at the doorway, while lud is fighting the boss. and then less than two minutes later, he's praising the summon. yeah, man. summons are smart and fantastic companions who absolutely know what enemy gets priority."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,this elden ring stream singlehandedly wins ludwig his most l by a game streamer of the year.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-13,"after radahn fight, we just beat him and were never gonna have to do it again. shadow of the erdtree"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-07,"its funny how there were so many earlier farms he could have taken advantage of suffering to farm a 3,000 a kill enemy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,i'm seriously impressed that you were able to do those twin gargoyles without giving up.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"everytime i tried to join that stream he was either sleeping or taking a break  still made it some of the time though, epic stream"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-10,i cant imagine making it to twin gargoyles and not understanding what a rune arc does.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,lud basically went through the stages of grief playing this game...... literally ended it with this is a good game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"for a guy with a mcdonald's sign behind him, his heart rate is pretty normal."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-20,i appreciate hearing koji kondos gerudo valley at the beginning and throughout this video also rip to patches either way
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-20,"seeing his heart rate spike during margit at that moment in the fight when you are supposed to finally get your first win but things start getting sketch is so fucking perfect because that is when you really are in that shit man lol heart pounds, might even get shakey lol funny af"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"great video bro! i have something to add which relates to your point about difficulty and dying at 242. when i'm trying to help a new player, i always stress the proper mindset to approach this game with. facing difficult, complex bosses is one of the most fun parts of the game, but only if you're not afraid to die, and only if you're not eager to hurry through all the content. if you just wanna get past a boss, it will be frustrating, and this is why a first playthrough is so hard, because you just wanna see all the new content and you don't wanna get stuck, so this mindset does not come naturally. but if you can find the fun in simply fighting, dying, and gradually increasing your knowledge and skill against each boss, then each fight will feel immensely rewarding. enjoy your time with each boss, because once they're dead, you can't fight them anymore. patience is key!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,"so here's a number one tip that i've never seen any beginner's guide mention in the game settings, turn your hud to always on. yeah it doesn't look as cool, but it shows you the status icons all the time. i first played this game for many hours with the hud set to the default setting of auto hide, before i noticed that, for example, you get a status icon when you are in range of a stake of marika. and the same with a certain status effect that you get from a certain person. the game is confusing enough without actively hiding useful information."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,just bought the game a few days ago and i've never played a souls game this was such a huge help for thank you!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,"ive been playing elden ring since launch, and this is by far the best written guide, tips, and no frills advice i have ever seen. great video"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"i have 9 characters all over 300rl, some over 400rl, so i have quite a bit of experience in this game, and i clicked on your beginner's guide expecting to see the usual misinformation and nonsense. i was so impressed with the first few minutes of your video, that i watched it to the end and gave you a like and subscribed. excellent work, you are so right about vigor, and so many people think they can ignore it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,"great video, really enjoyed it. one suggestion from me for anyone getting started dont go into a tough fight with a pocket full of runes. either go grind some more to level up, or spend them on upgrades. it really reduces the stress of dying."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,"a very wonderful guide. well done. also really appreciate the skyrim music in the background. even after all these years, hearing it still makes me smile."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,"holyshit, 2307 i just realized that you're the dude that helped me lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,new to souls games in general and after playing for about 15 minutes i knew i was going to need some assistance lol watched a lot of elden ring content since that point and this is hands down the best beginners guide ive come across!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"1 tip have fun! since 2009 i discovered demons souls and kind of have a different perspective on all souls games. as a fan of glass cannons, i never raised my vigor more than 40. and as a filthy mage, i rarely go above 20 vigor but still maintain 80 intelligence to pretty much one shot all enemies from afar ha ha"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"first and foremost thank you for sharing your elden ring wisdom. i have been looking for a video like this for a long time, and i have found it. thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"best allaround elden ring guide, beginner or otherwise, i have come across! i was having trouble with rennala. i could manage phase one, but every time in phase two, she would hammer me in just a few seconds. it was those magic attacks she was throwing at me. i couldn't stand up to them at all. i was in medium load with average gear and generic resistances. i looked through my inventory and realized i had this sorcerer robe, hat, and gauntlets with doubledigit magic resistances. but equipping them would push me over into heavy load. i remembered your advice that heavy load is always bad. i equipped them anyway, thinking that mobility wasn't my problem. it was getting slammed with her magic attacks and coming up dead before i could even get close enough to strike her with my sword. made it to phase two. as soon as she appeared i charged right for her. i don't recall if i even made an attempt to dodge her attacks. but i reached her and only had to wail on her 3 or 4 times with my bleed sword before the fight was over! her magic attacks were impotent against that heavy load sorcerer garb. there is my example of how going into a fight in heavy load was the solution to a seemingly impossible boss fight"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,really good video man! i'm going through my first playthrough now level 27 prisoner. and this video had a ton of really great info for me. i appreciate it! keep up the good work.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,"i'm coming into elden ring as a complete rookie, and your guide has been the most useful and digestible of the plethora i've seen. appreciate it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,this is the best elden ring video i have found and watched. i seen many but nobody explained how you did. i now understand this game and it makes sooo much more sense. thank you so much. i now wont get frustrated and annoyed and actually have fun playing
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"optional but important tip spend the first 1 or 2 hours to visit the churches at limgraves, weeping peninsula and liurnia to collect the graces, tears and golden seeds on the way. not only this will give you convenient fast travel points, it set you up so well with the number of flashes and the healing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"wonderful guide, thank you!! liked and subscribed.. as returning player, this has been a wonderful reset... my first playthroughs revolved around getting mimic tear summons asap, rushing through the content and playing keep away from the bosses...... this time round, i am trying no summons. learn every enemies attack patterns and slowly move forward.... so far, it has been an amazing experience, and the tips in this video have been extremely helpful..... i look forward to working my way through all of your elden ring content...."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"i just started the game a week ago. i've beaten sekiro shadows die twice, but elden ring felt confusing as a beginner. thanks to your guide i'll be on my way to enjoying this game. thank you, awesome guide. i definitely subscribed i look forward to more content on this channel"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,this is the first video ive ever seen on your channel. i literally just bought the game two days ago and was struggling to understand everything. thank you. this was very clear.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,"props to you for making this video, you touch on a lot of things first time players need, and i have been playing this game since it came out and even i took some of your advice to heart cause i didn't know it xd"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"glad you made something like this, definitely very helpful for many people including me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,awesome video! probably the best beginners guide i've watched. starting my first playthrough of elden ring will hopefully be much easier with this info!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,just started playing and this guide is by far the best i watched. many thanks subscribed!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,thank you bro! i have always loved elden ring but always gave up because it was so hard. im going back to it hopefully with your guide i can finish it!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,"great video, ive just bought a ps5 for my boyfriend and whilst he has been in work i've given elden ring a go . haven't enjoyed a game this much since phantasy star online when i was 15! thanks for all the tips. about 12 hours in and i've beaten the tree sentinel and dragon in the first lake. enjoying the game loads"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,i am a souls veteran and have beat er a few times with different builds and this guide helped me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-06,"thank you so much brother. playing the game for the first time and my second souls game i ever played, you earned my sub."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,just bought the game today after a lot of debating. finally have some free time more than usual where i feel i can sit down and actually grind this game. this guide had me locked in from the moment i heard upgrade your fucking vigor not many guides that simply get straight to the point. ive beaten sekiro a few times now heres to hoping i can survive elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,i got 400hours still watching guides why not
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i'm new to this game, and this was so helpful. thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"you sir, are awesome! subscribed bud! great video for all!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,"absolutely killer video, man. so well edited and curated. you communicate super well and in a way thats engaging. easy sub."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,"ahhh, finally, a man of class. straight to the point, and to the facts"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,"just gonna say that i'm two bosses away from earning the elden ring all acheivements trophy and i did this on the dark souls games also. that said  this guys guide is spot on. it balances between aluding to more while keeping only to the essential fundamentals with acompanying visual expalnations. excellent! i wish i had this when i rage quit ds1 all those years ago only to return to and finish it and ds2 totally after beating dark souls 3. diabetor's five 1 level vigour, please do this, for everyones sake 2 upgrade weapons often let this define your difficulty preference 3 use buffs, anything from fall damage negation and invisibility to simple damage buffs later learning the weaknesses of your enemies 4 practice dodging and avoid becoming over loaded 5 dont get frustrated  folks who do level 1 runs with fist only do this because they've realised in new game plus, eventually everything one shots you and armour never mattered. also all bosses have more health. so ng9 can be simulated with no weapons or levels...if only a bit dry. it's not for the pain, it's for the memory puzzle and focus challenge. the lesson for us normies you define the challenge  nevermoreso than in elden ring. thankyou to diabetor for making this guide!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,i really appreciate your video. i'm somewhat new to souls games and your video has tremendously helped me out understanding a little bit more than what others have stated
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,"dude, im just started playing er and almost tossed it. best video ive seen for it and way cool you to take the time to make this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,just got back into the game. i wish this video was available when the game came out. i learned more from your vid than the months of beating my face against a wall playing the game upon release. subbed and see you in the discord  thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,new player to elden ring and this was super helpful. played ds1 and ds2 and even in elden ring i always carry a shield im currently using the brass shield and its so useful if i dont know what im going into i can use my shield and stay at medium range and study and yh its elden ring so i get it wrong sometimes but the amount of people that criticise me for using a shield is insane. my shield is massively used dented and scratched but im smarter for it and will happily take a shield everywhere. looking forward to going through the game and doing the dlc when i get there but yh shield all the way medium range for combat and get 1 or 2 hits in when i see opportunities to. elden ring is hard for me i wont lie but the satisfaction and good feelings i get from my victories is something few games can give me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,subbed just for the delivery of tip1 level your fucking vigor
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,one of the best videos ive come across. great job!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"awesome upload, thanks for taking the time to make this guide. the upgrading weapons was a great advice for me to use ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,best guide i seen for any video game . straight cut the bs and got to the point.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,not a noob but always good to know more for other builds
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,i don't understand why you have such a low sub count? this is one of the best videos i've seen. this is similar to the conclusion i came to in lies of p which is my first soulslike and going to start elden ring this week.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,hard work has to pay off man! loved this guide! i played elden ring on launch but took a break till now bc of several reasons but now i wanted to restart my adventure and this video was really helpful! i know it's not much but as in return i of course liked the video and also subbed to your channel! keep these cool elden ring videos coming maybe some guides or how to create effective builds for different parts of the game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,"the point about not having to follow where the sites of grace are telling you to go is a very useful tip. i just got the game a couple days ago and learned the hard way, went straight to margit and got my ass handed to me like 20 times before i questioned if i was doing something wrong. i then went round and explored, geared up, came back and beat him on my first try. i think the thing that turns new players away is that there's no way to know that's what you're supposed to do unless you actively look it up. as soon as i learned what the game's actually all about, i started having a lot of fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,i think i'm going to try this game out...ive had a couple bad experiences with sekiro and ds3 but i feel confident that i can do this!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,im getting this game in a couple of days and i cant wait to try it out
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i'm 7.5 hours in, haven't fought a boss yet. there's a couple of samurai looking guys i've come across who have consistently beaten me up pretty good, and they aren't even bosses, so i'm afraid to attempt anything bigger than that! i'm definitely enjoying exploring the world, that's a big part of what drew me to this game in the first place, but progress is slow when there's only a handful of fights i can take on. i'll definitely prioritize endurance going forwardi'd been focusing on strength to be able to onehand the lordsworn's greatsword someday."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,awesome breakdown!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,100 agree with your vigor recommendation. your loadout doesn't mean shit if you are dead. i keep mine at 2x times max other stat until 60.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,i just got elden ring for christmas. my number one tip is bleed find a weapon with bleed and use that
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"spot on video, i've also figured out that square off is a really good ability, i was surprised!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,"great video. it's been a huge help,. thank you!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,best guide i've seen. great job man.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,"probably a foot note for tip 1, you can basically do 23 vigor to 1 dex for your melee builds as early game, the dual handing bonus should allow you to equip the bigger swords or be 1 or 2 points of str shy before you touch stra good example is bloodhounds fang. which i doubt many will use a shield with for the sake of its ash of war"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,lv up vigor is the best advice one could ever aplly! really realy thank you bro. sub and like. hope your chanel got 100x notice!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,"i'm not going to lie i started elden ring when it first came out and i'm still a noob i lost the game for ages only recently got it back i've just unlocked the mountaintops of the giants, i've only recently beat rennala, mogott, radahn literally only recently beat like those bosses. i'm using your video to relearn things thank you it has been a huge help you even got things i didn't know about back when it came out."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-31,finally...a video guide where i don't need another video guide to understand
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,this video helped me a lot. just the first tip was huge! i immediately respeced my character and got through the 2 valiant gargoyles in 3 tries after like 20 or so tries before. still having a hard time with those crucible knights though hahaha.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-09,"even if you're starting to get experienced with the game and start making extra characters, i'd say do the tutorial anyways, since it gives just enough runes to buy the crafting kit essential for some builds, and the buffs are nice and the torch good until you can find and purchase a lantern from kale in the church of elleh right off the bat without having to go kill anything else out in the wild. a nice little timesaver in my experience. also, gesture collecting. always."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,this video is inspiring me to try elden ring again... i just wish i had more free time xd
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"bro u just saved me from commiting stupidity , after putting 10 hours in the game , i felt like i went wrong with the warrior class and that i should have chose smthng else , was really about to start anew if it wasnt for your video explaining that most stats depend on what weapon to use and not the character ,thank you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,"small note, the final smithing stones are not infinite. there are a limited number of somber ancient dragon smithing stones in each run."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,"i started about two weeks ago and its not thats hard i got the hang of it now , this is one of the best games ive ever played"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,samurai dragon glitch is op
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"glad i found this, thanks a million bro"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,i love the gino call out. made respect
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,"i'm very happy that i never ever looked at any guides when i started playing, and only started after 100 hours or so. i think the first 20 hours were the absolute most fun and exciting because i had no idea what i should be doing, how big things would get, etc. it was all new and exciting and challenging"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,i used tree sentinel to get used to the game mechanics. i died multiple times but i learned how to dodge and beaten every early game bosses up to godrick. i also beat the bloodhound to get his weapon.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,excellent video. thank you sir d.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,thank you man. the other guides were confusing and contradicting. i knew by the language in this one it was the right one! i am ashamed to have owned this game for 2 years and hardly played it although i did manage to kill the boss on the horse on my mount by just dog tailing him  when i first seen idiots on youtube rage quiting this game and everyone saying it was to hard it was i thought screw that and carried on playing elderscrolls which i recently quit  looking forward to seeing what this game has to offer and will definitely check out one of your build guides after exploring a bit.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-04,"on my ps5 version i had platinum it with my level 143 sorcerer and the only fights i had real difficulty with is radahn, the black knife tiche, and the final dual boss. those 3.5 bosses kept smashing my face to the ground like sigrun in g.o.w 2018"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,"after playing sekiro for a few years, elden ring is extremely fair."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,"crazy part is im currently in my 1st blind playthough and im at malenia with 42 vigor lol. i went straight to margit and beat him without exploring. before i understood anything about buffs and weapon leveling. after that rage inducing boss fight dual wielding scimitars, i made it a point to explore. i assumed every area has a main boss so i loot and level up. still, i didnt understand stat distribution. so i was running around with high strength faith and intelligence. mad bc i didnt understand how to use incantations lol. literally beat the 4 bosses before altus plateau before i used a buff lol. aside from the physick with strength knot and crimson tears"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,absolutely a banger video! wish i had watched sooner i see armor isn't as important and should dump more vigor
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,i havent played in over a year maybe so im watching
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"so, yeah im late to elden ring. its one of those games that ive been curious about since launch but the reputation of soulslike games being absurdly difficult has always kept me away. but recently after stumbling across a random elden ring lore video and seeing you can learn the lore by exploring i decided to give it a shot and see what happens. im currently about two hours into my journey as a tarnished. ive gotten the flasks, met melina, gotten the ability to level up and ride torrent. ive wandered around a bit and levelled up a couple times. ironically both into vigor because my monkey brain went hp good until i understand the stats more. and i think im starting to see what the fuss is about. im definitely going to need to fight some more to get my muscle memory dialled in but im definitely having fun, even if the boss at the end of the tutorial cave beat my hide a couple times until i got the basics of combat. hopefully we can have more than one character at a time because i already want to try another base class to better understand what im good at. edit i saw the guy on the horse right away and didnt even try to fight him. i immediately slunk around him. it seems like im getting a decent amount of understanding the basics."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,tip 1 is a must. im glad i filled vigor
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,i never knew i could stack bleed by adding an ash of war that adds arcane scaling to my claws.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,i love the fact that you used skyrim music for your video
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"bro this video is so good. i actually started playing elden ringidk right after i beat black myth wukong in october soooo im like 220 hours or so in. disclaimer im legally blind visually impaired , i have glaucoma and i fall a lot in this game. but i wish i had seen this video before i started elden ring. a lot of these tips are things ive learned via trial and error. i beat maliketh first play through in 2 tries, and the fire giant was really fun but not too hard. i do have a mage build i did rannis quest and my build is focused around frost, the dark moon great sword and glintstone sorceries but also ive just started to experiment with night sorcery before going to the haligtree or the ashen capital. gravity has been super difficult for me cuz sometimes i think theres a platform and i just die. getting into norkron took a long time cuz i had no idea where the entrance was lol. also this game has like cave entrances that are not like super obvious lol. but my mage build i really like it at this point and i do have some points in strength but i wish i had leveled vigor earlier. i have 42 vigor rn and im just now realizing how much of a difference that makes. i think i had 20 vigor fighting rennalla but she was super hard. my intelligence is like 73 rn and my mind is like 25 and my endurance is around 25 or 30. but i just recently learned how to use smithing stones and somber stones sooo yeah. elden ring is very fun but i learned a lot of this stuff via trail and error this is a great video for new players. ive been enjoying it so far. i usually play zelda games so this game is super different but very fun!! like you said in the video i thought leveling my stats meant my character does more damage i didnt realize i needed to level my weapons. also i just realized a couple days ago i could craft things.crafting sleep pots wouldve helped other the godskin duo before i fought the snake boss there. also i didnt really i shouldve used serpent hunters weapon skill to fight that boss. i didnt know how to use weapon skills when i fought that boss.so now i know how to use weapon skills. i also like using summons black knife tiche has been my primary summons. i didnt use summons before i got her but shes great i leveled her to 10 lol."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,it took me a long time to finally play. i was intimidated and i gotta say its really not that bad. the amount of checkpoints to replenish is pretty damn forgiving. not an easy game but not impossible like i once thought
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,great vid!! subscribed
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,grew up with souls' games and i refuse to level vigor until i've maxed my attack with a great sword. 100 hours lvl 60 so far
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"lots of great recommendations here. after years of playing souls games, starting with the relatively unknown demon's souls in 2019, i've found that a player's worst enemy is over confidence. this is especially true with shadow of the erdtree where over confidence  fafo!   minus 200,000 runes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-16,ive looked at a lot of videos to help with tips and this is by far the best for developing your character
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,"i spent a lot of time farming runes. each round of farming made enemies die faster, and me die slower without any other upgrades. it also made 90 of bosses a cakewalk. killed radahn in less than 3 minutes, first try. also, i rarely use buffs. great video, lots of great info, but farming runes made me a monster."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,man thank you for this!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,"i like your guide. i've watched a few beginner videos from different creators. love your delivery. i've never played a proper souls game before unless the star wars jedi fallen order game counts? i never played it because i never have much time but i found i have lots of time if i stopped focussing on wasting time on worrying if i have enough time. i had the attitude of dying often isn't fun and with my illusitory lack of time made me not want to pick it up,."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,that endure tip is funny once ur other poise break
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-10,have i beat elden ring multiple time yes. did i still watch this entire video yes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i adore this game. i honestly believe this is the greatest game ever made. love it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,goated video brotha
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-03,really great guide!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,tip  farm or buy a sword with square off early. it can help with struggles through the whole game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"i'm about 7 hours into the game first time fromsoft player here! and i initially decided to go in blind without looking at any guides. my dumb ass spent that entire time up to lv 30 while putting stats into endurance and vigor equally and sticking a few stats into str too... whoops managed to beat margit and make it to godrick somehow, but i think i'll spend some time exploring and raising my vigor to 30 as you advised before trying godrick  thanks for the great tips! edit only leveled my weapon to 1 too because i was worried that the materials would be limited and i didn't want to level a weapon til i found one i liked lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,great video funny af
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,ahhh oblivion music
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"hahaha i would consider myself a decent player with decent knowledge, but i still watched this video, just wanted to see his approach to teaching new players. i just watched the first tip level vigor and i could instantly tell, this video was made by someone with knowledge. so yes, level vigor! i'm interested to see how the video continues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"a bit more context on george rail road martin's involvement here apparently he wrote all the lore and did the worldbuilding for everything before the world was destroyed. so back when all the ruins were actual civilizations, that's what he put together. then miyazaki et al. took all that and made the game about after the world falling and decaying. so he didn't write anything specifically for the game, but created the world that the game then ran down and destroyed. really interesting way of doing it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"never commented before, but seriously i've gone to these reviews first for years now, always consistent, very well put together and to the point, thank you for always uploading fantastic content, especially with these. i'll even watch them for games i dont anticipate playing because there's a chance your review will convince me otherwise. i usually follow it up with the things i wish i knew when starting for a game after i end up getting it lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i think one reason this game is getting so much love is that they didn't promise everything in the world like some of the other games. they just said here is an ambitious open world game that we hope you enjoy playing. and it delivered even more.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-12,"i just picked this up after 2 years avoiding it. i dont typically play games that are this difficult, because life is difficult enough. i game to escape. but then a friend convinced me to pick this up when he explained to me why souls games appeal to him they are digital recreation of all his real life challenges i get it now. creating a character that looks just like me, placing him in this brutal world, and going in with the mindset that every challenge here represents my own harsh realitiesthe game just clicked. its more than the simple, casual escape from reality that im use to at the end of the day this feels like an exploration into of my own potential. that is quite a special feeling i wasnt expecting from a video game, and one that i havent felt since i was a kid."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,thank you guys for doing these before you buys. they help a lot especially when you have limited money!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"745 i spent 40 hours before even walking towards the first bosses direction. between the sneak system, and new checkpoint statue system the game really encourages exploring and doing your own thing without fear of losing anything"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i love how fair and balanced these are. nothing exaggerated or suspicious like you can see from the big review sites, and it really just feels like a friend breaking down a game's pros and cons in just the right amount of detail so when i see such a glowing review from here i finally feel like my hype is legit! can't wait to just get into the world and run around with some friends."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,"so glad the before you buy series is still going. consistently reliable reviews. truly, thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,it's kinda crazy how we go from a game drought to a flood of great games. too many to play at once when it felt like the last year had almost nothing really good to play.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i've been playing since friday, i don't think words can justify the experience. few open worlds have a real sense of danger that makes exploring not only fun, but necessary, and rewarding. i expected the game to be good, i didn't expect it to be this good. i don't know how far into it i am, i did beat margit, and several other bosses, but there's just so much of the world to explore. so many different enemy types i've seen already, i'm honestly blown away and i've played all the soulsborne games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,i think it's really cool that they finally added a better sneak element to the game. you can use bushes and walls for actual cover and lose your enemies or jump out and surprise them. more so than in any other souls game that i've played.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-07,you are thanking us? we are thanking you! you've saved me often money. excellent content without any spoilers. your videos is a must for me before i buy a game. thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"if you just take the few minutes to watch these, youll never be let down when buying a new game. you guys really let us know about the good and bad parts of any game. i also love that you guys have different tastes in games. really gives us different perspectives."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"man i'm so glad this game is delivering, i cant express how good it feels knowing we can still get games like this despite the industry often nto living up to our expectations. to those who play it, hopefully we can join in jolly cooperation or perhaps even pvp."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"lets be honest, most of you guys have already made up your minds to buy this game before watching this video"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-09,"i gatta say  the before you buy series has always been reliable and consistent, much love"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"one of the best gaming channel out there... sincere, truthful and direct..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i can't wait to play this game. the organic open world that isn't jammed full of quest markers sounds just fantastic.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,iconic!!! weve made it to elden ring!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-20,20 hours in and this is the first game in a long time that has me totally into it. really nice to see after wasting money on cyberpunk and battlefield recently.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"as someone who has never played a souls like game this game looks so interesting. i'm honestly thinking about pulling the trigger and try this new genre with this game. edit after doing a lil more research of the game and reading everyone just saying to go for it and giving me tips on the comments, i have preordered the game just now. thank you for such a warm welcome everyone  can't wait for friday!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,747 the most shocking part is being reminded that theres a jump button. you can justjump over things
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,i cant believe we're about to experience elden ring. its actually happening.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-07,i can't even describe my love for this game i only just started on it last night and easily topped four hours on it just literally exploring and noticing i hadn't really got anywhere with progress in a sense doesn't even frustrate me because i genuinely want my time expanded as much as possible in that beautiful world
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"this game looks like every dark souls players dream. a massive open world full of really good enemy types, weapons, lore, and terrain. great review guys! this looks like a contender for one of my favorite games of all time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"i love it, and with the mount it gives off some big shadow of the colossus vibes but more. it's as if the game they initially wanted to make is finally realized. the games always have encouragedrewarded exploration but now with an actual jump function, and mount they really took the gloves off. this game somehow plops into an oversaturated open world market like it's one of the few that belongs there, and it really is. bravo!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"something i think is really cool is how approachable the different combat styles are. i started the game with a bandit and realized really quickly that i like fast attacks and didn't really care about defending that much. in hindsight, the warrior probably would have been a better class for me, and i was a bit worried that maybe i'd made the wrong choice. then i realized i could have my character dual wield and now i have an assassin chick who combines all the best parts of the bandit's strength with the warrior's combat style. it's pretty great."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-21,to anyone who hasnt played a souls game and want an example of how insanely hard the npc stories are check out bok the seamster. he's literally a small tree you have to meet and then meet him at different locations that somehow you are just supposed to be able to figure out. the npc stories is what made me replay the dark souls games many many times. the first time through it seems like the impact they have is almost nothing but once you play though the whole game and realize how much content there was you missed it gives tons of replay value.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i usually dont even watch ign or gamestop reviews anymore, these are my favourite. its like hearing a friend tell you his opinion, straightforward and honest."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,fromsoft's work on sekiro is clearly seen in this game. it looks to be the culmination of all of the best and greatest pieces from each of their titles and i'm so excited to play it. happy birthday to me
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i can't think of a time i've ever heard jake say i swear and he seems really excited about this one. i'm so glad that out of all the games coming out this month this is the one i preordered
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"another thing that i liked about the game were the arts used in the loading screen , each one had their own color and shade that just fits in the game without going overboardand they look sick as hell. great review btw!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"025 and we love you jake and the gameranx team. literally my favorite gaming channel. more honest than ign, more reputable than the other channels scattered across, and honestly just more fun to watch."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"this is the review i was waiting for! i know i can count on you guys for a balanced, sincere, no frills analysis. thank you and keep up the good work!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,you know youre a fromsoftware fan and a before you buy fan when you listen to the video face down so nothing gets spoiled but you still support byb cus this show is the only review show for games thats not hours long and not half assed. straight to the point. consistent. and i do appreciate when you offer your own bias and perspective on games as well. you make sure people know things like ive never been much of a fan of these games or i love this series etc etc
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-18,"2 years later, i bought this game for the first time a few months ago. never thought i would be a souls player, never thought i would like this game im now 100 hours into my first playthrough, plus multiple coop mod games with friends, it is just amazing! as a first time souls player, it wasnt as intimidating as i thought. the graphics, world building and combat is phenomenal! im glad i found this game and decided to try it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"358 literally an action movie moment, love this. thank you for all you do, gameranx. i appreciate you guys more than i can put into words."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,absolute best game review series to ever exist. been that way for years. long live before you buys
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"this game had the most hype ive ever seen a game get. and if you guys said it lived up to that amount of hype, then this game is truly amazing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-24,"i actually waited to see all the reviews and gameplay to decide if i wanted to invest 60. such a great game. took me 8 hours into the game to actually understand the game lol, but so cool to be able to explore and just take your time understanding and getting better at it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"really love how you presented this with light spoils but nothing that would ruin the surprises of the game! as always, top notch work you guys 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"massive respect to jake and the gameranx team for always delivering accurate and quality reviews. they were the first to jump into every game regardless of whether it is good, bad or just mediocre. thank you for your massive contribution to the gaming community gameranx!! we love you!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"i can honestly say that the before you buy videos are the only video game reviews i listen to when thinking about a new game. even an old one on sale i youtube the byb and get their opinion! keep up the great work jake, falcon and gameranx!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-17,"literally coming into this review months after it's been out and you guys nailed it on the head, jake and the team keep on proving again and again that they are the goto for game reviews"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,so glad its turning out well. these games havent really let me down and it doesnt seem like this one will either. thanks gameranx!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,the mutual jump attack at 357 was simply magnificent
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"015 man i been watching this channel for years, you are one of the few gaming review channels that have never led me wrong, keep up the work for many years to come guys."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"this game is amazing! im so thankful for bloodhounds step. that ash of war really helped me get by margit the fell omen. as always, awesome upload, awesome video! love all your guys content!! thanks so much!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"somehow, i just knew fromsoft could deliver. it's really something seeing all this glowing praise for the dev team's accomplishments. it's like watching the birth of a glorious new age where every other open world starts to ripoff its formula but that would actually mean putting in effort to populate your open world with cool content."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,glad to see developers are still making quality single player open world rpgs
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,every time a new game comes out before you buy is always the first place i go because more often than not its one of the most balanced reviews out there
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-22,"this is my first souls game but the witcher 3 is my favorite game of all time. half way through your video i paused, bought the game and started the download and then continued watching. i'm genuinely so excited for this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,"i haven't bought elden ring yet but when i finally get the cash i'm gonna buy it. something that made me always stop playing dark souls wasn't the difficulty but the way it felt, it felt so stiff to play but footage of elden ring looks so fluid and i'm really excited to try it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,thiss one game we know everyone thats watching this already bought or already decided to buy. not a negative review about this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-20,225 lmao george railroad martin
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,50yr old gamer checking in. i have heard a lot of hype over the years  nothing has delivered like this game! absolutely stunning in both design and execution and even accessible to an old guy like me who has never played a souls game. a triumphant victory and a high water mark for others to aspire to.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,gameranx and acg are the only channels that seem to never steer me wrong with their reviews and what not. thank you guys!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"just stumbled across this channel rightnow for the first time i think. gotta be commented really good quality critics, expert at work. good explaining, good examples for explaining, perfect choice of words to make it understandable what a gamer would have to expect, how it feels and so on. all together best gametest video i've seen so far. so many gamereviewers just talk like this well i personally didn't like that or that, but this was cool, look at it how awesome. but you put ur pros and cons in relation to eachother, u make smart and deep comparisons, you're analizing it as neutral as it can get or should be. i really appreciate someone doing what he does that good. you should be highlighted for this tbh, frustrating to think of clicking 5 others while not knowing that you exist with videos exactly like this, which everyone who wants a real review is looking for. it's like finding a fresh fish under a bunch of cheap, deepfreezed fishes  i like to repeat this sentence in this kind of comment of mine over and over again keep it up,the good viewers realy always notice and appreciate the difference!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"ever put so eloquently, this is the reason i am subbed to you. the videos and highlights are impeccable !!. great content and always appreciated. thanks so much ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,this is my go to channel for all things gaming even over the official gaming networks. always honest but never bias. appreciate the effort you guys put into every review  know i can get enough feedback so that i dont waste my hard earned dollars
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"as someone who never really got into the dark souls games, i really feel like im missing out if i dont at least give this game a try one day especially with how impressive so many reviews have been so far."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"y'all are who i look for when i want to review a game, i look no where else yall are legit what drives me towards or away from any game i need info on an i cant thank yall enough please never stop posting videos!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-24,"i love games like its crazy how much effort they put into this game, and i never played souls so this is an must play for me, i love open world games, and love big bosses its insane how good this game is and cant wait to play more of thanks for showing me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i love these reviews! it feels like a friend explaining a game to me and helping me determine if its for me or not, good stuff man never stop making these."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"been playing through the soulsborne games for the first time other than demons souls, only got sekiro left to finish and these have become some of my favorite games and i think an open world is the next big step for these games. can't wait to get into it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"mage build looks op dang. i went with a confessor, classic sword and board with a touch of magic. found a couple neat side bosses too!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-27,"i am going into my 3rd playthrough first ng since i just made two different characters so i could take the characters into different builds easier and over 200 hours in and i'm still finding stuff i didn't before. this game is the first open world rpg or game in general that has just completely sucked me in to the point if i'm not playing i'm looking up cool new builds i want to try. i have never been a big fan of souls games because of the extreme linear difficulty and was subjective about getting this game since it's made by the same devs..but how i wish i had got the game at launch with everyone else because omg this is just a masterpiece in just about every category and all of which you have covered. i just hope this makes other devs see that this is how you should do open world, i think this may be the first game i eclipse 400 hours in in a very long time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,gameranx has been my go to for anything video game related for years now. just a team team of people putting out great content. thank you for the hard work you do and keep it up!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,"bought it, started playing. got stuck on the first boss. im gonna love this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"one of the most authentic and relatable youtubers that gets straight to the point, keep up the great work"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,just got this and its interesting to explore. i wish the combat was a bit more fluid and easy to control but ill get used to it. id like to get as fluid as ghost of tsushima combat feels
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"for those of you who are new to gameranx, this is hands down one of the best, if not the best, gaming channels on youtube. the quality of the videos and the hosts is on another level. thank you, gameranx for another fantastic review!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i think i'm gonna dive into my first soulsborne. i've always been scared to play because i'm honestly... not that great at video games. i suspect i'll get mad at this one a few time. but this really does seem like something new and exciting, but it also has this old school atmosphere. the world looks visually stunning, and some of the abilities here looked interesting. also, i just want to revel in a game that is well made in 2022."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"one of the few channels where i watch every single video. great job gameranx, you guys are awesome"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i like how these guys have almost 7 million subs and they are still humble and showing gratitude.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i am absolutely looking forward to playing this. only began my from software addiction last year when a friend finally got me to play sekiro. loved dark souls 1  3 , demons souls was great  what else can i say about bloodborne other than masterpiece. looking forward to rage moments , hilarious coop encounters and the reward for finally defeated a super tough boss in elden ring. this weekend is gonna be fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,you can always tell exactly how jake feels about these games based on how enthusiastic he sounds when he says ...another episode of before you buy... at the start of the video
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"fun fact, there was actually an interview about what martin had a part in. he actually wrote the worldbuilding of the world before the elden ring broke and the world was twisted and tarnished. so everything he came up with turned into monsters and other various things which is honestly cool as heck."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,as a person who only became a fromesoft stand after their greatest game bloodborne i'm so happy to see an evolution of the formula
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,me  watching almost every before you buy vid after buying the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-24,you guys are the first resource i think of when checking out a new game. keep up the great work please
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"god damn, when i grew up in the 2000s and 10s i played alot of really amazing games, gta, mass effect, elder scrolls, vtmb and numerous smaller games but damn seeing all the newer games come out makes my inner child so nostalgic wishing he grew up playing these games. i don't have time anymore to play games but wow i'm honestly jealous."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i wasn't 100 sure about this one, as these games usually kick my ass until i rage quit, but the highlighting you did on the pure exploring side makes me super excited to hopefully get this soon! just have some backloggers to deal with first...and i'm patient enough to wait for the first sale as the finances have taken a hit...thanks covid!! thank you folks for this awesome byb!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"a game that has actually lived up to it's hype, for once. never doubted fromsoftware for a second. you don't get average with these guys, nor do you come to gameranx expecting average content. quality all around."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-02,1 year later. best purchase i have ever made.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,before you buy is the best gaming series on the internet
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,at 748 when he just jumps over the balcony has me just excited. to not only have another souls game to conquer but to be able to explore a whole open world while im at it has me chomping at the bit to play. only 183003 and counting to go
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,"great review, you and your team always do an excellent job"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"thank you gameranx for these well put together reviews, always on point!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,"when i first played this game, i was honestly bummed out because i couldnt even processed because of the tree sentinel. dark souls deal with overcoming obstacles, bloodborne deals with dodging, sekito deals with timing and deflecting, but elden ring deals with patience and gamer pride. this game will not take it easy on the players. if the player is too under leveled to proceed, their is no one shoot miracles. the players are either going to spend hours on the internet figuring out how to defeat the tree sentinel or, the better option, to give up once pride and come back to the boss with better gear. even while exploring, players will still die by bosses that later on feel easy and laughable. elden ring will test the players patience, and willingness to continue. in many moments within the game, i could have said f this game, im going to delete it. but i didnt. just like every from software game, the key to success is within the players ability to adapt and improve. if the player feel stuck, this game wants the player to be humble enough to go out and look for better alternatives, rather then fight a boss that is way too high level. heavily recommended and a must to all players everywhere. edit for those who are still new and dont know whether to buy the game or not, let me assure you that, i have beat this game 4 times now and i still stick but my original statement. i wrote this comment when i was still on my first playthrough and now im heading for the 5th one haha. pro tip, invest in hybrid classes and dont just stick to just one. invest in intelligence and faith based magic, be creative and dont allow your pride to get in the way. many dark soul players believe that the truest way to play is with a sword and a shield and anything inbetween is called cheating. i had to learn the hard way that their are more ways to beat a boss then to just spend hours getting frustrated and losing all ruins for a single boss. if you read this far then buy this game haha, trust its worth it once you get passed your first playthrough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"just want to say thanks for the videos, been watching for years. helped me make the decision to buy it as i haven't had much time to play games over the last year. love these reviews! probably my favorite gaming channel!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-27,thumbs up if you skip ign and gamespot straight to gameranx cause you know it's gonna be a more honest review
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-23,"yesss, needed to hear your always excellent views on this before considering the purchase! thanks to the team for all your hard work!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,you guys do the best reviews i know of. they always feel honest and unbiased and looking at the comments i know i'm not the only one who appreciates it. keep'em coming!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"this game looks so awesome! i feel like this game is going to be their most popular title yet. it seems to be more beginner friendly. i just played dark souls this past fall, and bloodborne about a week ago. these games can be very punishing, but once you get the hang of the mechanics, they become much more manageable, and 100 worth the initial pain period. can't wait to play this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-24,"814, definitely a print and make a big ass frame painting like to hang in my room, this game exudes beauty"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,thinking of this as a game where you can chill in the open world then do the harder content sort of changes my perception into something im interested in. as opposed to the past souls games where it just felt like a grind of linear progression. i kinda got bored of that so this might be a breath of fresh air. going to put this on my wish list and wait for a sale though. too many games im playing right now to hop into this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"i've been watching these vids for a while now, always looking forward for pros and cons and... i might have missed it but i dont think i heard any cons on the whole vid lol, i was hoping to hear a bit more of the multiplayer aspect of the game but i really really appreciate this vid helping me make the final decision to get the game!! much appreciated"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"i'm obsessed. listen, these games have a completely different feel to them that alot of people don't get. it's a lonely melancholy slow methodical game. even though there are millions of players around you in elden ring, it still manages to make you feel utterly alone. but know friends are always just a summon away. most npc's, people won't even do their quest lines because they randomly move around and don't tell you where or what to do. there are going to be so many different builds for pvp it's going to be crazy. the real fun for me starts after i master the game and start invading and parry baiting the host and gank squads and do a plethora of trolls and emotes lol. just need to find out how to invade still! i'm taking my slow sweet time with this gem. 27 hrs in right now and i've not even completely explored limgrave. only performance issues for me are, couldn't get online on series s because some people had the wrong version on the game at launch, praise the ring  gesture keeps going in and out of inventory, dragon offering statue failed to load shop couple times, one failed to load after getting trapped by patches. barley any noticeable pop in and some minor frame rate dips but nothing i would call lag. now the pc version looked way lagg. people comparing it to the release of cyberpunk hyperbole for sure. it runs great so far"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-11,two years later it still holds up top tier game cant wait for the dlc

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-04,pretty cool that this run employed so many different strategies. would have been a bit boring if there was always just one easy thing to do to oneshot every boss.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-03,"i really appreciate the more indepth intro breaking down a lot of preliminary questions. i do kind of miss the attempt counter, but totally understand how bonkers that can be"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-04,why do you run faster than i do? asked the man who has consistently stayed in heavy load when fighting a light load enjoyer
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-03,y'all this was absolutely insane to see.. i know it's long one but y'all don't want to miss alot of these kills ... especially the demon himself  yall gotta watch till the end

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-11,"one thing i might be stupid if i didn't notice, the executioner sword's ash of war does magic damage i believe, so stuff like terra magica and the magic physic might also work with it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-30,used this strategy on bayle several days ago. quite a joy to watch his health melt
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-28,basically the elden ring equivalent of daedalus stormbow and holy arrow combo
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-26,"i need more goth melina, whoever drew her created a work of pure art"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-16,that hey goober replenished my soul
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-03,i love devil trigger playing in the background
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-14,watching jeenine has taught me the power of golem arrows
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-24,hey goober and then the biggest grin came outta my face
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,gotta love the pull my devil trigger playing in the background.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-03,never been so emotional touched by the word goober
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,i was gonna scroll until i heard hey goober
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-12,"like you well accurate, but i am the best mid of middlers you will ever meet"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-01,"i love how the volcals of devil trigger are playing in the background, i knew something seemed familiar"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-06,i swear i only watch these shorts just to see the art work
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,calling someone a goober is such an endering way to pick on someone
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-18,that one person who realizes radahn's greatbow has the upgraded version of this ash of war oh yeah i'm doing both gravity and shockwave damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-13,no way you put the lofi version of devil trigger in the background . you gigachad
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-10,"like you hurtful, but also accurate"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-09,thank you so much. i started seriously playing this game this year. i tried it out a while ago and didn't get into it. i'm doing a bow and arrow only build now. and i really hate that my friends seem to have no faith in my build. it's dissappointing beacuse now that im really into this build im also very into the game which is what they wanted but theyre just dissapointed i picked such a boring build but i just keep telling them i'm cooking up some heat and they just don't understand. i just really don't want a load out like everyone else i wanted a completely unique play style plus i like shooting things. but thank you so much for the tips. i mainly use the black bow but i have the lions greatbow also as support against big dudes and usually use raddahns spears cause i can buy them. but now that i know golem arrows have a shockwaveaoe effect i'll be using this to make the ash of war more viable. sometimes when i use rain of arrows like 60 of the arrows miss and this can counteract that because of the splash damage. also thanks for the low ceiling tip i'll make sure to use that do my advantage when i can!!! i follow you now cause you talk alot about bows on your channel and that's awesome cause i think this style of play is underrated af.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-02,"devil trigger in the background, nice"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-09,a soothing version of devil trigger i hear in the background amazing artwork btw
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,"ahh yes, kinetic bombardment, my favorite ash of war"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,my phone heard hey google as she said hey goober. wow
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-04,i love how you're using devil trigger for the music
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-06,not me holding my breath when she said mouth breathers..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-10,goth melina smiling at me makes me feel emotions i'm not ready for.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-28,"melina, why didnt you warn me that the godskin duo was in the next room over"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-02,devil trigger just chilling in the background
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,imagine if colossal bows were a thing and the hand ballista is just a straight up ballista that you carried in both your arms at a snails pace but it shoots arrows like an archer golem
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-25,like you that made me flinch at that
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,nasty i'm down to hear that word again
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-14,never did i think i would have needed melina calling me a goober
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-03,i love hearing devil trigger in the background
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-15,ah yes i cast. stunlock
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-09,"my my my she embraced the dark roderika fully, and it worked. p"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,devil trigger is peak combat music imo
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-11,"videos like this make me want to do a bow only run someday. then again, im a big fan of ranged combat rather than being in peoples faces"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-10,"like you. i can change, goth melina"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-14,is that a chill version of devil trigger playing in the background?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-12,the devil trigger menu remix hits different
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-09,love the music less devil trigger in the background.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-13,"like you i have a heart and feelings too, you know ?! they hurt now  a lot . how could you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-15,"the aow rain of arrows can be used on regular bows too, not just greatbows, but the specific radahn's rain aow is specific to the lion greatbow and is a slightly stronger version"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-03,i did not need that like you thrown in there
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-04,hearing devil trigger in the back ground just through me off
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-18,love the subconscious devil trigger track.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-20,"golem arrows can be found at any archer golem you slay, but meaning you have to farm the archer stone like golems in any location to get it, hope this helps"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"that moment when you are wielding in each hand a colossal greatsword of black meteorite steel, etched with gravity defying magic runes, taken from the corpse of a warrior demi god who once had enough power to halt the very motion of stars, but you're getting slaughtered by rats because their teeth are apparently as strong as my swords"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"dunkey is so real, he beats the game 4 times and loves it but will still point out to you the biggest flaws with the game in the most entertaining way. the goat of game reviews."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,i love when dunkey is so passionate about a game that he doesn't mention knack even once throughout the video
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-03,the worst part of this game is that none of the bosses challenge you to a space jamstyle basketball game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"my man knew he had to beat this game 4 and 12 times just to be able to say, it's too hard. i love it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"rather than turn enemy damage down, i think the player needs to be able to increase their damage mitigation actively, more. leveling up your stats should have a greater effect on it as you scale later into the game, where the damage starts to actually become a problem."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,cant believe dunkey gave a spotlight to this small indie game even when they could afford 0 donkey kongs. he really is a nice guy
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-18,the health bar is a ruse. you have 3 hearts like in legend of zelda a link to the past. it's just that you're fighting an orbital space cannon powered by the disappointment of christmas gifts you didn't get as a child.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-29,this man beat the game 4 times in the amount of time i've played half of this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,if he completed it 4 times that makes the dunkview a 4010. not a bad rating
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"health isn't a problem in this game, clearly dunkey forgot to level himself to 300 and put all of those points into vigor only"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-19,i dont think ive ever been more frustrated with a game ever in my life 1010
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"when he said this game big, i felt that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,got to agree on the point that kiling a knight that has insane moves give pathetic runes compared to killing easy foes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"you don't understand, this game is easy. jusy switch to a bleed arcana mage long distance mimic tear build people who says this is balanced"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-20,this is an evil game made by an evil man... hahahaha nailed it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"i mostly agree on the balancing....its the fact that it swings wildly between too easy and too hard is the real problem. i am constantly changing from feeling overlevelled to underlevelled, often in the same area."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-03,"my favorite part was watching the bosses do a 30 hit combo, dodging it perfectly then failing to get a counterhit because they landed too far away. great game nonetheless"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,im so glad he mentioned how the respawning giant guys that cant turn and have 1 attack are worth almost as much as a non responding mini boss in the same area thats much more difficult. when i killed him i thought there was some glitch because he wasnt worth the effort for that little at all.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-22,the guy in charge of damage balance didn't show up to work again.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"i've put 200 hours into this game and the rune scaling for enemies frustrates me the most. dunk put it perfectly here  you get basically no runes from normal enemies and even minibosses, so you're incentivized to run past things you've beat once and grab items on the way, and either use sleepy boys' farming ledge or rush main bosses so you can actually level up"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i completely agree. i've beat the game 7 times now don't judge too hard and i love it. but the amount of damage enemies do breaks the rpg elements and basically forces you to waste countless levels on hp just so you can not get instakilled. even with the best armor in the game and almost 2000hp, you can get 2 shot from full health by some enemies. that is garbage. that's not skill based difficulty, that's wasting my time. still love the game but the balancing for some stuff is truly abhorrent. luckily they changed some balancing in the latest patch so maybe they will continue tweaking things in the future"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,spot on with this. the scaling is insane and you can do a whole dungeon and get 3k runes after a boss that will make you its bitch but you can shoot a bird 4 times for 10 times the amount.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-25,premorgott and postmorgott genuinely feel like 2 different games. i enjoy making a new character build just so i can play premorgott elden ring some more.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,"honestly while i wasn't super aware of it as i played, dunkey's final point really hit home. i dumped heavily into vigor, having an insanely big health bar, combined with a greater rune to give me even more health, still get one shot. how did i beat the last few bosses? a super cheesy double giantcrusher build and my mimic. cause if i got wrecked by malenia's jumping flurry attack one more time i was going to lose it. i hope fromsoft does adjust the damage values on some enemies, because it would help with more build variety."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"just like all masterpieces this game is flawed, and dunkey is not scared to highlight all the negatives even when clearly loving it. a true critic."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-21,"the damage near endgame is indeed a problem. leveling your vigor to softcap is supposed to give you more chances to recover from fucking up. it's not supposed to be a minimum requirement to prevent a single mistake from killing you. you shouldn't have to level your vigor to softcap to prevent the game from feeling like you're doing a sl1 challenge run. when i want that experience i'll choose it by keeping my vigor low. the fact that you can get 1shot with 40 vigor and 33dr in ng is absurd, but merely one extreme of the issue. pack leader mobs can 2shot you with attacks that are as swift as an r1 from a straight sword. mobs can turn a single hit into a guaranteed second hit that will 2shot you. during my first playthough, i pumped my vigor from 27 to 40 because i wanted some leeway. i was using dual daggers, favoring ripostes with the critical hit hp recovery talisman. i wanted that hp leeway so that when i took a hit from a trash mob, or got clipped by a swift boss attack, or missed a parry by a few frames, i wouldn't have to top off to prevent one more mistake from killing me. if i could get a critical hit without fucking up again i could recover from the initial mistake. but near endgame that leeway disappeared. i stopped using the critical heal talisman because i could no longer use it safely. i stopped trying to learn parry timing because a single small mistake, a single misread of enemies with timing mixups, could easily kill me. often you lose so much hp from a single mistake that a single flask can't even put you back to safety. it's not like this was a single boss my build was poor against. it's entire areas bosses, minibosses, tough mobs, and even trash mobs included multiple areas even!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,"it's sad to think how many bosses would be infinitely improved if their damage wasn't so badly overtuned. getting your ass kicked around the arena by a tough boss can be heaps of fun, but getting nuked so fast you learn nothing about their attack patterns, then spending the next five minutes staring at loading screens and running back to the fog door is incredibly dull and frustrating."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"im so glad im not the only one who had that reaction to the map constantly getting bigger. i feel like the developers knew exactly what they were doing with expanding the size of the blank map beyond its borders, instead of it all being visible immediately like in horizon and botw"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"elden ring has some of the best examples from any fromsoft game of why i don't feel bad about cheesing fromsoft games. enemies have absolutely no problem stunlocking you, hyperarmoring through everything you do, oneshotting you, or doing really whatever they feel like to make you drop your runes. you best believe i'm going to come back at that shit with every tool under my belt idc if i gotta lure em off a cliff or snipe them from on top of rock lmao fuck them"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"i honestly have to respect dunkey for giving elden ring a chance even though its not a strandtype game. obviously its not going to be on the same level as brilliant titles like death stranding or knack 2, but it is a decent little game for what it is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-27,"wholeheartedly agree with dunkey here, the damage output of enemies is astronomically high. there are so many instances where you can go from full hp to dead in less than a second with you not being able to do anything about it that it just gets exhausting and once you do win, it's less of a satisfying hell yeah, got their ass and more of an exasperated thank god that's finally done, i hope the reward is actually worth it. it's artificial difficulty, whether others will accept that or not. i feel i was truly beaten when i got out played by someonesomething outmaneuvering, not when the game just says lol you got grabbed and instakilledyou didn't react in time to that auto kill combo that gives you 1 frame to react. this game is fun and i enjoy playing it, but the balancing stops existing at some point and it hurts the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"spot on. as much as i love this game, the moment i first dodged under a boss' high jumping attack and watched him track 180 degrees to land the hit anyway, i knew i was going to be butting my head against some true bs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,this game really makes you feel like maidenless
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,elden ring is an amazing game. honestly one of the most phenomenal games i've ever played. that doesn't make it immune from criticism. you can love something and still recognize it's flaws.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-08-18,"elden ring falls into a specific category of why the fuck does armor have stats?. for like half the encounters that matter, it just makes no sense for me to have a lot of armor, because i'm going to get one shot anyway, while being weighed down by armor."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"absolutely agree with this take. the scaling is absurd and the bosses seem to have infinite stamina, leading to you running desperately away from endless combos. my late game boss victorys dont feel earned, instead feeling like i had to beat my head against the boss until the one attempt where they didnt decide to one shot me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"i love how it doesnt introduce you with some dungeon. just tells you to become elden lord, and sends you off. its great"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"its because this game is so incredible that the balance issues are so highlighted. could be a 1010, but wow is it just so cheap and dirty out of nowhere. when the random guy in the hall before the boss room can 2 hit you at level 150? but you just steamroll the boss behind him? ugh... anyway, my mimic is the true elden lord."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-05,"i feel like a major issue with a lot of bosses especially in the late game is the lack of a meaningful punish window. think of pontiff in ds3, dude was very fast and incredibly aggressive he had this one move that felt like a 15 hit combo, but if you were able to successfully dodge that combo you were able to get 34 hits in. you were rewarded for playing well. elden ring they just launch into another combo or hit you with an attack thats so fast you barely have time to read it. just seems like you dont really get rewarded for playing well most of the time. still love the game tho i just think they kinda fumbled there"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"at the beginning, he said he played it through 4 times, at the end it became 4 and a half. it means that dunkey played through half of the game by the time he finished the video. such a legend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"he's not wrong, in some of the dungeons you have regular mobs that have more hp and are more of a threat than the actual boss. i died to those mobs several times then killed the boss on my first try without breaking a sweat."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-07,"i remember the final boss of dark souls 1 had that combo that if you had a gigantic health bar and good defense it might not kill you, but that was one combo he had, it was telegraphed, gave ample opportunity to heal after and he didn't do it all the time, but in elden ring it feels like most enemies have that combo but it does double the damage, still loving it, i just want to love it even more"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-23,the trick to beating a highly aggressive boss that can two shot you is to do cocaine
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,gotta love how dunkey makes the same point a lot of people have about the bosses and late stage enemies in this game but since it's him no one is sending him death threats.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i agree, especially with new comers to the souls series, getting 2 shotted with 50 vigor and heavy armor shouldn't be the norm. understandable if you're a squishy mage without a single point in vigor with robes, but not so much for melee builds that have to get into the mess. having incremental increases would help, in ds1 your naturalbase armor would go up by 1 point. in ds2 your health would go up by 23 points even if the stat wasn't vigor."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,a game can be beatable and still not well balanced. people tend to forget that for the sake of blind defense of their favorites. great video.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-01,this is an evil game made by an evil man. that should be on the boxart for whatever ultimate edition is released down the line. love this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i've played this for over 50 hours so far and i think i'm only half way through. definitely the best pokemon game of all time, i can't wait until i find and upgrade all those legendaries."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"it's kinda funny, in the beginning i deliberately went into a glass cannon build cos i just wanted all the stats to use the weapons i wanted and mostly ignored vigor so i expected to get killed in 1 or 2 hits. now, in late game, i brought my vigour up to 3040 ish and nothing has changed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-30,"i've beaten the game just about 7 times now with varying builds and i fully agree with enemies doing way too much damage, as well enemies especially bosses having a ridiculous amount of combos they can string together with very little time to retaliate with heavier weapons."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,"yeah dunkey nailed what's probably my biggest issue with the game. the difficulty spikes are so bad sometimes it genuinely doesn't feel like you're improving. i remember feeling like i was somehow getting worse at the game going into the later areas but when i went back to the first area i was an unstoppable killing machine. i had actually improved a ton, but the game cranks enemy stats up so much in between locations that it felt like i was weaker than i had been when i first started! it's just not satisfying in the same way other fromsoft games i've played are, because unless you have the right builds that feeling of hardearned progression is just... not there."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-02,when you need to be perfect over 20 times in a row to beat a boss and they only need to hit you once then you know the balance is off.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"328 having super aggressive enemies with crazy combos with unpredictable attacks is the fun kind of difficult. but making those moves hit for your entire health bar is fucking lame. this is the biggest problem by far, at least in the end game, that this game has. this game would feel far more fair if enemies and bosses still had the same crazy attacks but they didnt nuke your health bar. even at 60 vigor some things can still 2 shot me. he's right about fixing it too, and luckily with stats and data and feedback hopefully fromsoft will balance the game better going forward including the number of runes enemies give"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"dunkey isn't wrong on the damage balancing, even before i played the game myself i've heard veteran souls players mention that elden ring was the hardest souls game they've played, and i never understood why. but when i myself experienced getting one shotted over and over again i finally understood. i do like the aspect of it being a lot more unforgiving in the end, i'd still rate it as the best game i've played in years though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-05,"the thing with elden ring is that it's balancing is purely handled by locational scaling. each entity has a base hp and dmg values which you then slap an area scaling plus ng area scaling, plus ng clear count scaling. there are a total of 21 different scaled zones at the game 29 if you count newly added unused ones probably for the dlc, from the stranded graveyard which has actually no scaling at all, to the haligtree roots which has a staggering 740 boost to enemy hp and almost 380 boost to enemy dmg the world and enemies outscale your character massively, especially once you start reaching your soft or hardcaps. ultimately, it ends up creating a situation of pure artificial difficulty towards the later stages."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,this game really makes you feeeeel like sean bean.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-06,finding the balance between genuine critical analysis and humour must be very difficult. but dunkey makes it look so effortless. he's been in the youtube game a long time and it shows. i just love it. thank you dunkey.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i've not been addicted to a game like this in years. this is a proper escape, like a game should be. i thought i was growing up and less interested in gaming, maybe that isnt the case after all."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-17,"two years later and there's still a ton of sidequests i haven't done, weapons i haven't found, skillsets i haven't explored. this game dwarfs pretty much every golden age jrpg from the snes and ps1."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,i think another area of critique to hit was to many colossal bosses that have the ability to move instantly to the other side of a massive arena causing you to have to spend 3060 seconds walking back over to them. a few of them dont give you horse access looking at you space bug skeleton and elden beast makes a gorgeous fight into a total slog
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i do find it weird that since bloodborne, they removed the option to upgrade armor. maybe they should bring it back to compliment defensive scaling."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"im about 200 hours in and on my second character and this is so accurate. that late game difficulty spike feels like it comes from nowhere. love the game, but the difficulty makes so many potential builds not even worth trying."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-18,it's frustrating that you rarely hear mention of the awful late game difficulty scaling because it gets drowned out in a sea of praise and git gud deflecting. glad dunkey brought it up. looking forward to the dlc but i hope the devs can bring things back to earth a little bit
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,i always look forward to dunkey's game reviews. honestly this made my day so much better
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i have to say, i completely agree about the damage scaling in this game. the damage to health ratio is far more in favor of damage in this game than any previous souls game, and lots of players from those games have taken notice. to some extent, i don't think it is changing the difficulty of the game, as your character also does considerably more proportionate damage to enemies. however, it tends to fall into this boom or bust style of play where you either win handily or get killed almost instantaneously."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"there's also other problems with certain enemies that are just straight up annoying to fight. some seem to endlessly combo without any real openings, others will literally teleport after you hit them once, some will just automatically dodge your attack and jump 15 feet away after you spent 5 minutes dodging their shit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-20,i love how he could say how good of a game it is but the moment he talks about how unbalanced it is you can already hear fromsoftware fans furiously typing
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"they did balance the damage from a lot of the bosses and more difficult enemies in the latest patch 1.03. which only came out about a week ago, so its understandable that everyone had so much trouble with it. i did too. edit from 2024 i lied to you all. they balanced the damage of radahn. every other boss is still broken and the dlc is no different. also the damage wouldnt be such an issue for certain bosses if they actually had good move sets. but the unpredictable timing and input reading of so many attacks makes them incredibly annoying to dodge. unless you want to memorize the timing of every attack, which is not fun. or use a summon, which is not fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"i beat this game four times on the same character and got the platinum for it, i agree with dunksman, there is a lot of bs powerful oneshot attacks and cheap deaths, and it really makes me feel justified in saying that you should cheese this game's enemies as hard as you can and as much as you can. go ahead, overlevel it's fine, do it, kill those sleepy frog boys for hours that's fine, because you know what's up the hill from them? a boss who death curses you if you didn't go get the magic anticurse stone from an outoftheway church where an angry red npc invades you and tries to chop you up but she drops the stone and you didn't even know it existed until you beat her after stumbling into the encounter in the first place. then you need to put that stone in your magic flask and drink it at the right time. nothing in the game tells you any of this by the way. i had fun with it but it's balance is nonexistent and everything straight up cheats by having infinite manaammothrowing pots they can use against you. so what can you do? grind, cheese, and use every dirty trick you can, exploit every weird wall or pillar, kick enemies off cliffs, poison and rot them and run away from their attacks, zap them with lightning from a place they can't reach, there is no honor to be found in the lands between, and the only thing you can trust is dog pope."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"dunkey has a unique way of putting my 50 minutes of rambling thoughts into a digestible, 5 minute take on a game. i wish i had that talent."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-24,with the new dlc the damage complaint just got even worse in my opinion.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"definately agree with the scarce upgrade materials. i think they coulda put the items that let you buy smithing stonesgloveworts waaaay earlier. lots of variety, little opportunity to experiment. they did increase smithing stone availability in a patch, they may tweak it even more again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,"i definitely agree with the balance. i'm getting to what i assume is act 3 of the game and it feels like by this point the game is balanced like it expects you to be cheating with some stupid broken build. and don't get me wrong, i am but it just feels like it's a race to do my stupid op bullshit before the game does its stupid op bullshit and it's gotten a lot less engaging because of it. first 30ish hours absolutely blew me away though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"you're totally right, i absolutely love this game to death, but the postmorgott difficulty feels like someone is beating up a child version of me, yet i can't stress how incredible this game is"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,"the thing i agree with most is that from soft discourages experimentation with different equipment. they truly are stingy, and i couldn't believe they did what dark souls 3 did placing a limit on the number of highest upgrade materials in a single playthrough. it's a huge open world game with so many fun and awesome weapons! and they even let you respec your stats so you can try different builds... but nope, you can't upgrade more weapons to max to complement more builds, if you've already used up your highest materials. makes me miss ds1 and ds2, where you could farm for titanite slabs and have a fun variety of max weapons in your arsenal."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,it's so refreshing to see an elden ring review that isn't just ignoring it's faults
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"i finished my first playthrough at over 160 hours, which is crazy. i thought it was fantastic, but heavily agree that some enemies were designed poorly in late game due to the high amount of damage they did and they never get tired. like they just keep swinging at you without even giving you a chance to hit so you end up just using mimic whenever you can to at least aleviate that. i dont mind the mimic, i actually think it was a fantastic idea, especially for someone like me who does not want help with bosses from other players...except melenia, because screw her!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"currently 90 hours into my first playthrough, i don't like to start criticizing a good game until i have beaten it, but dunkey really hit the nail on the head with this one. the difficulty spike along with enemy damage is ridiculous and downright sometimes not fun at all to deal with."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-22,"only now that i finished the game for the first time almost at the end of ng now, i realize that this review is 100 correct. an incredible game held back by poor balancing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"100 agree on damage scaling. having the enemies and bosses have complicated sequences feels rewarding to overcome, but if the punishment for any lapse is functionally instant death its just not great design. it stops being challenging and turns into patience testing. im taking my time and still enjoying myself, but i am barely eeeing a reason to invest in health, when i just get one shot by anything worth dodging anyway"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-27,especially the enemy scaling to runes exchange. grind those sleepy grey aliens and you just found an exp exploit that will level you throughout the game... but half the minibosses will give you scraps for runes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,240 very humble of you to at that point not mention that you hold the world record on bowser's big burrito
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,i'd like to take a moment to appreciate how absolutely stunning the music in elden ring is. astonishing.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,the fact that this is a coherent review is among the highest praise in itself
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,it's good to finally have someone actually say the damage bloat in the game is a problem. a lot of the people who do souls content and gush over the game almost never mention this. dark souls 3 40 vigor would have gotten you halfway through new game easy. 40 vig in elden ring? pocket change.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,the way this game looks is easily my favorite part. entering the crumbling farum azula for the first time and seeing all the tornados was incredible.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-28,019 is my favorite dunkey sound. i keep coming back to this video just to hear it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"definitely agree with the late game scaling. i had to leave malenia to go level up, then i had to respec twice all over like 6 hours just because of how absolutely punishing her damage can be. then i left and shit right on the final boss in my first go. like what?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"100 agree on the runes... i've noticed that myself, you can have two different enemies, one crazy difficult, and one pretty easy, and they give similar rune rewards. it just seems insane. i also agree that late game it feels like all your power is for naught... though i feel it was that way in previous games as well. dark souls 3, the first dlc, also has a lot of high health high damage enemies that don't care about how highly leveled you are."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,"i agree with the damage scaling, in ds3 it felt like you where keeping up with the bosses. but in eldin ring it feels like youre booted back to level 1 every 5 hours."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-08,"i just beat this game for the first time after 120 hours, and have since gone on to play and beat all three dark souls games still working on dlcs. this game is a masterpiece with a serving of bad design mixed in that's too big to fully ignore but small enough to accept and not let it ruin the enjoyment of the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"what i felt was the case is that, because the enemies output a lot of damage and can do so in long sequences, you're forced into being incredibly patient. however, not only are the attack strings often long and very punishing, the time between attack strings is very short. this results in you watching the boss dance for 10 seconds, you landing a light attack or maybe a heavy jump attack and then spectate the boss going buckwild again. this strat will get you there... but it's gonna take a long ass time because many bosses also have significant hp pools. should you fuck up somewhere along the way just once or twice, you're likely to die. i'm not sure if the fix is to lower the damage output or to lower the healthpools of the bosses. if we compare it, for instance, to bloodborne i never felt those fights were just slogs. bloodborne had some crazy spammy and high damage bosses, but i also felt most of them went down quite quickly. thinking of bloodborne, there might be another solution increase the drink speed of the tears. vials were quick to use and it fit the highly aggressive nature of many bosses. the ai in elden ring often aggresively tries to counter your drinking. that is paired with the short windows of downtime between attack strings. so even if you survived a long combo, got hit by the final hit and want to heal, the boss is already ready to charge at you and prevent you from drinking."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-25,"finally a big reviewer takes elden rings flaws seriously. it's not perfect, but it's still amazing!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-23,absolutely agree with the difficulty tuning. the bosses seem to vary from 'regular enemy with slightly bigger health bar' to 'how on earth am i meant to beat this thing when i die if i look at it.' it's a damn shame because these games had the most incredibly rewarding moments in boss battles and elden ring's bosses just seem like an inconvenience that you want to get rid of so you can continue to explore the gorgeous world created.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-08,"i think the prevalence of weapons like rivers of blood, moonveil, giant crusher, etc has really psyched people out of using weapons that they like. i'm plowing through my second character exclusively using serpenthunter because it looks cool and i'm having a blast. i do think the late game damage spike for enemies is really odd. my only explanation for it is that they balanced the enemy damage in accordance to late game optimized builds like bleedarcane or maxstrength. it would be cool if the enemies starting doing as much damage as you do to them, but that just isn't the case for a lot of players. that, in turn, leads to this weird dissonance. i think if the armors were to get any use beyond fashion and poise, they should be able to substantially mitigate certain enemy damage types. don't like the dogs? bam, antidog armor. don't like the stupid hellfucker perfumers? boom, antiperfume armor. at present, the armors are all pretty much cosmetic, beyond some random 3 to a stat or extra poise. i would like to see more put into that area of the game. maybe boc could do more than just cut off the cape of your armor and actually customize it to your needs? it would also be great if 40 vigor wasn't required to survive even one hit in late game. that really feels like some kind of oversight. against radagon, i had to put on pearldrake 2, haligtree 2, and dragoncrest shield talismans plus lord's divine fortification for him to even feel like a normal boss. it was pretty ridiculous."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,exactly right! bosses are supposed to be about the back and forth. you beat the shit out of them and they beat the shit out of you but if you're smart you can get your heals off. a good fight drains you to no flasks left. on a lot of late game bosses i usually either died instantly or won with like 10 flasks left because i didn't get one shot. you hit the nail on the head dunky
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"elden ring is to me a masterpiece, but i'm glad dunkey's willing to talk about its' flaws, it's important to recognize what could be better especially in the best of games so they can be better"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"i do agree with dunkey on the balance issue. malenias waterflow dance attack being the best example of just how utterly onesided the balance team was against the player. the attack honestly feels like it was deliberately made to just oneshot the player no matter what level of health they have, how far away they are and what armour or shield they were using. if it had just been the one attack it would have been fair, but she does it three times in a row and can practically fly from end of the arena to the other with the amount of ground it covers. its absolute insanity. whenever she wound up for that attack i basically just lowered my sword, obiwan kenobi style, and accepted my death because there is no point in even trying to avoid it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-02,this review was so accurate and funny i'm watching it again
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,purple hue because otherwise youtube gets scared of possible videogame blood
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"i was laughing my ass off at this, ohh yea how do you beat a giant fire monster... more fire !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,ranni in nothing but a tshirt is something i never knew i wanted until now.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,there is a letter at the entrance of messmer's castle that says keep away these fire bombs from the golems
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,this takes the phrase fight fire with fire to whole new hights.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"when furnaces get too hot they can actually just shut down and need to be repaired, so, this makes sense."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-20,"you could even say they are born of the fire, made golems by the fire, undone by the fire."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,whoever is doing your music mixing deserves a raise for adding mattrexs theme while talking about these guys.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"another tip regarding this for the unarmoured ones, you can throw a furnace or fire pot into their core right after a critical hit as they begin to get up. can get some extra damage that way too if timed right"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,mega man x5 mattrex ost in the background. nice.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"you can find a note just outside the shaded castle talking about this, by all the broken down furnace golems. the logic is that you're basically throwing gasoline onto a bonfire, adding even more explosive fire to the golems makes the heat so intense that it damages the frame of the golem itself, and enough damage makes them fall apart."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,always love the music choices on each of the videos here! megaman throwback took me back
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"there's a little bit of that logic of fire beating fire, but... damn, this is a hell of a giant vessel of fire beaten by a small pot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,lord gwin look what they need to mimic a fraction of my power
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,my problem is when you don't have enough pots so you have to climbed down and run away to recraft the pots
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,unironically the armor legged golems are easier because you cant use the fire pot trick on the others.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,out of every enemy i've ever faced in elden ring. it's only these guys do i ever feel like it's an actual chore to face against. the method of taking them down is so mundane.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-17,stabbing with my spear while on steed. iron golem is just .
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,the use of megaman x5 bgm here was very nice
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-19,"i usually just run past them, although its like a damn michael bay movie when i try."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"04 hefty fire pots or 03 hefty furnace pot  there's a document near the entrance of shadow keep that's says to keep fire pots away from the furnace, especially if they cause fire tornadoes furnace pots"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-18,"fun fact, the furnace fire pot, the version of the giant pot the require the unique item the furnace golem drop, can be used instead for the normal hefty fire pots to kill them in 23 pots instead of the 56 hefty fire pots."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,another tip is ancient dragon's lightning. it'll stagger them just about every second cast.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,same energy as the poison bulb guys blowing up from poison pots
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,counterpoint ancient dragons lightning strike
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,tbh i lked the idea and the gameplay variety is always welcome
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,someone called them ankle monitors  i can't stop laughing everytime i see them now
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-19,i actually enjoyed all of them
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,megaman x5 fire area theme.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,uses fire  is brimming with fire  becomes revived from fire  can be unalived with fire
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,ranni sounds so aggressive maybe she needs a choccy milk to calm down
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-08,i started laughing my ass off when you said complete balls the accent is funny af
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,i miss my lady roderika  bring her back please
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,i just figured it out from the trailer. at least they did that
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,who else thought you had to jump your horse into it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-26,"hey you know how to put out a fire golem? set it on fire! wait, that makes no sense."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,it should have been a heafty oil pot making a big explosion
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,it took me so long to figure out i need to throw hot pots to kill a oversized torch
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"i cant get close to it, its like a machine gun rapper spitting flames constantly nonstop, giving me no opportunity to get to the edge of the cliff to throw pot at it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-17,hearing ranni mad was something i didn't know i needed
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"so fighting fire with fire, nice."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-19,fr i tried 4 different big pots of different types and not once did it cross my mind that more fire would kill them i would have done it but when you add fire to fire normally fire get stronger i had to throw out logic for the fire golems but still an interesting idea just with it was the big ice pots that would make more sense
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,fight fire with fire simple as
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,"i actually really like them. they are mechanically fun to fight except that one vortex attack and they are a cool and epic way to get tears, unlike the ulcerated tree spirits."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"i thought only furnace hefty pots or whatever they are called worked, i wasted all my resources on those lmao."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"i have to thank the messages people left on that cliffside for helping me figure out that solution. yeah, i agree. that's very baffling."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"whats more annoying is even with something like 5 hefty fire pots, the great pot helm and every talisman to boost fire damage, i still couldnt kill the one near lamenters gaol. you need to make the rarer furnace visage pots, or grind to get more pots overall. and the visages required are rare drops so killing that guy was a pain in the ass."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,someone on the dev team was definitely thinking fight fire with fire!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,everyone using fire with fire is stupid miyazaki exactly
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,there's a note outside the hippo bossfight that gives a pretty big hint that you should use fire bombs on the furnace golems
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"completely agree. i ignore all of them. while the bosses in the base game that drop the tears for the physik flask are annoying, because they're so frequent, those guys in the dlc tho.. now thats miyazaki testing his limits on the annoyometer"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-16,"this does make sense .. especially if you read the note that says keep those fire pots away from my golems!  love, furnace golem maintainer"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-26,fight fire with fire
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,the giant jar helmet helps a lot. it amps up the power of your hefty jar attacks
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,"the furnace golem is basically a walking hell, they took a long time to take down one of these firey ballsacks"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-16,you got me with the megaman x5 background song.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,ranni became the new queen and realized it wasnt gonna be a cakewalk
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-16,if you want to end this war you're gonna need a bigger fire snuffs the flames
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,it makes sense to me. there's a letter than implies that fire pots will overload them
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,"i love ranni when shes angry, shes so cute!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,"i personally really like fighting the golems. i find it satisfying getting the poise break on them. i think it feels great toppling over a giant like that, slowly breaking its poise then finally knocking it down to then crit it for 10s of thousands of damage."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,i want ranni to tell me about the great beyond staff apparently it can use both incant and sorcery
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-06,the common phrase fight fire with fire'' comes to mind. they even taught that in an episode of ben 10 like a decade ago.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,fighting fire with fire taken to another level.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-24,"that actually makes sense. every so often, a new fire can burn out the old fire. it's how firefighters do fire control with a fire that's been going on for days."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-16,the pot you throw is a vortex of fire that fucks with its own flow of flames.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"thats kinda makes sense to put it into the game again. since in the base game there are those poisonous things in some locations, and if you throw poison on them they kinda overload and explode. you can buy a note from a merchant somewhere and the note literally says it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,my ass thinking they were called wickermen
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,i appreciate the megaman x5 fire stage music in the background. they seem like a nuisance to deal with
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,"damn, that mattrex stage theme as bgm goes hard."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,"for better effect, you should use heft furnace pots. not only it deals more damage, it also interrupts whatever attack they're about to pull, allowing you to safely demolish it after you got the first hit in"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-16,there is a message note you can find that says vaguely as to why it is important for messmer's to keep more fire away from the cauldron part of the golem.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,for the regular golems use the dagger talisman for increased riposte damage and the physic cracked tear that increases poise damage to knock them down faster. just a lil tip.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-24,"you know, until watching this video i just used the bolt of gransax and chucked it at the face"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-28,you know what they say you fight fire with fire.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,fight fire with fire a saying thats existed much longer than we have
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,this is the definition of fighting fire with fire.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"the new pest thread spear incantation and a dagger for when they fall can defeat even the armored ones, you just have to toggle aim at their face when their armored and give torrent a workout. no pots required"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-17,"yknow what they say,fight fire with fire"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,x5 music??? whoa ranni loves mega man?????
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-31,"the hefty furnace pots are even better. harder to farm for though. they also work on the other unshielded ones, instead of a crit just toss a few pots at 'em while they're down."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-28,when fighting fire with fire is taken literally
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-17,"burn dinorex stage theme playing in the background. proper choice of music, i have to say."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,actually the furnace pots are better than the hefty fire pots. its also made from a material dropped by the furnace golemns as well. fire pots still work but theyre just not as good.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-04,love the use of mmx5 music
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-27,takes a whole new meaning to fight fire with fire
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-18,i never beat those armored ones because never in a million years would i have guessed they were weak to hefty fire pots.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-15,"fighting fire with fire is an ingenious tactic. when two fires from opposite directions meet, they put each other out."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"you can discover a note in the dlc that says you can also use the new whirlwind fire pots, takes 3 max to kill one with these"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-23,"the old saying was always, fight fire with fire."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-18,takes fighting fire with fire to a whole other level.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,burn dinorex theme was a nice touch...
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,"miyazaki heard the saying to fight fire with fire once, and said i want that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-18,i only found out about this after reading the 50 messages in front of one saying try item crafting try item but hole and my favourite try fire but rump
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-21,think of them like machines that you have to overflow with their own gogo juice
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,"there's one in the way to the cerulean coast that you can kill it by hiting the legs, but you can just go to the red area above the coast forgot the name, lure the golem with arrows and then, with some aim, throw pots on it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,"its actually the hefty furnace one, which not only awake to eepy ones, it also does more dmg to them killing with 2 or 3 depending on their hp"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,"whirlwind firepots are their true weakness, does insane damage. there's a note next to a scrapped golem next to the shadow fortress main gate that tells you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-25,"the first time i killed the first one you come across was a nightmare experience. those plains it is on are not flat. it managed to, twice in a row, land such that its head was unreachable. meaning i had to knock it down like 5 times the time i killed it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"well as a person who uses a strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith arcane build i feel offended"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i'm arteficer, witch means i go boom"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-05,"i do love the recognition that gandalf is actually an angel and, therefore, a faith user despite being one of, if not the progenitor of the wise old wizard archetype."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-12,dex cant kill me if you can't hit me. i'm fast as frick boi!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"as someone who maxed strength first as my main stat, and played through elden ring roughly 1014 times with two very large iron swords. my response is yes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-17,"dexterity nya, look at me dancing, kawai 90 stab wounds"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"i would say strength, but tbh i beat my first playthrough with mimic. destroy my enemies and my health is yours. although i didnt find out you could level summons until i was at godfrey not piss godfrey."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-20,"i personally enjoy a thicc faithstrength swordsman build. no bulky heavy weapons, moreso making use of a mix of melee and faith attacks."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,i always use the biggest sword i can find
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-13,im all of these. just depends what the run im doing requires. though im admittedly a big fan of faith builds. whether just faith or hybrids with other stats theyre a lot of fun imo.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,my dexterity and intelligence build would probably look like one of those unhinged anime professors.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"as long as i get my greatsword, shield, bow and heavy armor i don't really care. though, you can get somber weapons maxed out earlier than normal ones so i don't really go for pure physical."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"im a strength user but i do have a pretty good amount of dext, faith, arcane, and intel but mostly strength and endurance"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,strenght is the only right way of playing. mindset is basically bonk
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i dont understand why everyone loves strength. while with builds like dex, faith and int you develop new playstyles strength is just bonkdps"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"welcome to the walkthrough. this series will cover everything needed to obtain all trophies in the game, in addition to making an effort to acquire every weapon, spell, armor, etc. that you can in a single playthrough. the first few episodes are going to be a bit fast in our pacing as i'd like to cover a lot of various starting items for a variety of playstyles. also, if it's your first playthrough i highly recommend you play blind. if you want to follow this guide from the start that's your choice, but you'll never get back the discovery of things that comes along with your first blind experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,"i just wanted to say how much i am enjoying your walkthrough. i am 63 years old, these games are hard for me. it is my first time at this hard of a game. thanks for taking the time to do this walkthrough."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-19,"just wanted to say that your videos stopped me from deleting this game. being that i've never played dark souls or even watched it played, i was pretty overwhelmed. look, i'm coming from world of warcraft and i've gotten used to having my hand held. so, i was humbled over and over and over again. i just knew i wasted 50 bucks. i searched youtube and came across these videos. only having watch part 1 and 2 i was well on my way to exploring and playing the game as it was meant to be experienced. a truly unique adventure indeed and i just love it. thanks for helping out a newbie."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"your walkthroughs got me through demons souls, dark souls 1, and bloodborne. if not for your walkthroughs i would have never got through these games i now love. elden ring is great so far i am using the tools i learned from you to go in relatively blind. i will watch this to see if there is anything i missed. thanks for all you hard work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"this right here is a walkthrough, someone who gives tips and knowledge on the game while you watch and play. i dont think some of these other youtubers dont always know the difference between play through and walkthrough! i appreciate this cause this is much needed especially for this game! thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-17,"thank you so much for your walkthrough! it made the game so much better for me! i played for awhile and then got lost as there are barely any directions or indicators of where to go, and how to approach each area. i was just running around for a long time. then i searched and found your walkthrough. i have enjoyed the game and the different areas much better, and no longer feel like i am in the dark with important parts or items. i would have missed so much. if you complete and find a lot of the items youll find this game has a lot of depth and can take a long time to complete everything. i personally think this walkthrough should be recommended to any new eldin ring player! thanks for all your work, tips, advice, and content! thanks!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,"its a shame there are no special you tube awards or elden ring awards, because you bloody deserve one for this masterpiece of work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-15,hardest part of this game is realizing triangley is how you interact with things instead of xa. every npc and resource in this game is gonna see how high i can jump by the end of this
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-21,my 25 yo son gave me this game for fathers day. so glad i found your channel. excellent walkthrough. thank you.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-24,exactly 4 weeks until shadow of the erdtree dlc!! who else cant wait to follow cowboys walkthrough for it?
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-13,"i tried this game at launch but for some reason hit a wall 30 hours in and just stopped playing. after all the awards and praise, and because of how much i loved other souls games ive played, ive decided to give elden ring another go. thanks for creating this series so i dont have to go at it alone! the social aspect of these games is something i value deeply so at the very least having this walkthrough makes it more worthwhile"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-18,"just had to say that your walkthroughs are the best i've ever found online. the attention to detail, the respect for your viewer's time and your own, and the indepth guidance. cheers man."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-10,"i am a 68 year old grandmother and i have played dark souls 1 and 3, lords of the fallen  so underrated ! and both remnant games. love this kind of game but i have been putting off elden ring  mainly because it sounds huge. today i finally started it and im excited ! especially with fightincowboy at my side  as usual. keep the games coming"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-03,"i struggled with other walk throughs and totally messed up quest lines, so i started a new character and followed this guide all the way through to 81. he is easy to follow, gets you through tough spots, and moves at a good pace. highly recommend!! btw, i am a pc player with medium skills, so everything in this game is a challenge for me  good luck!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"cowboy, thanks for having the dedication to provide this community with the astounding content youve been able to deliver over the years. at first, i didnt imagine a walkthrough would exist for this game and i thought man, it wont be the same playing a fromsoft game without him. then you delivered. youve helped thousands of people acquire every item in these games as well as direction in a series that can be overwhelming. we cant thank you enough for what youve done for us."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-16,"easily one of the best walkthroughs ever! i love how you take the time to explain everything and so much effort goes into these, just really appreciate your work"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"anyone looking for an amazing and complete walk through, youre in the right spot cowboy is an absolute legend and will guide you through this entire monstrosity of a game. thanks again cowboy for a wonderful experience."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"this guide is way underappreciated. as someone who had only played one souls game for only about an hour, elden ring was pretty intimidating. had no idea where to start, but this walkthroughs series did an amazing job of setting me on the right track"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-15,"ive probably commented this on one of your souls walk through, but i appreciate you doing these so much! 41 years old with a restaurant business and three kids and there is just no way i have the time to learn these games the way they need to be learned. but these walkthroughs give me double enjoymenti can now get through the game in a friendlier timeframe plus i get the enjoyment of watching your videos! thanks again, this is entertainment and service. i love these games a lot and so glad these videos help me to be apart of enjoying them!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"here from the year 2025! and with your guides, i have finished all of the souls series and also bloodborne and sekiro and now i am here, with elden ring! cowboy, your walkthroughs have been invaluable to me in my journey to complete all of these games and i would have never made it this far without your exceptional and incredibly detailed walkthroughs! thank you cowboy and you are without a doubt the best soulslike guide on youtube"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-25,thank you fc for this walkthrough. when i first started elden ring i was lost i was probably going to delete the game as it is my first time playing a game like this. you helped me through this walkthrough even 10 months later and i just wanted to thank you for being such a good guide for millions of people on many games. we all appreciate you!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-28,"man i absolutely love this playlist. it is a golden example of how walkthroughs should be. short and to the point, yet filled with everything you need to know!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"first time playing this sort of game, very overwhelming but the freedom you get from just exploring is astonishing, i still dont quite understand what each item does but im sure it will all come together as i play and research, this walkthrough is incredible, it has shown me just how vast this game is. im in awe."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-19,i remember loving your darksouls 2 walkthrough. and here we are again many years later!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,thanks for taking the time to make these amazing walkthroughs. i have used both your dark souls 3 and nioh 2 walkthroughs and they helped sooooo much.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,"no way. i have been following your bloodborne guide and was at work and thought i wonder if theres a platinum walkthrough and you came up and i knew i was good. i have beaten elden ring so many times, but i am always getting sidetracked so this will be so helpful!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-11,im going to do a 3rd full run through using your guide. i cant wait. this time with an intfaith build. just such a great job. i also went and did the ds3 guide.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-07,"the amount of respect i have for this man to take the time to make dozens of detailed videos so people can get help and understand what their objective is. you're a real one, keep it up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,completing this game without a walkthrough was one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. just took 250 hours lmao worth it
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-14,i have gotten my first platinum thanks to you and this walkthrough. what a wonderful experience thanks to you!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-13,i rage quit this game so many times only to realize i missed out on so much of the actual game. thanks for putting together this series.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,this is an awesome start for the walkthrough! i like how you explain things to players new to this game. i spent a hour in the game before using this walkthrough and i didn't you could mark places on the map and the markers show up on the compass!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this is such a daunting task cowboy, i thought it was a huge game up until i got through stormveil castle and saw liurnia of the lakes and just thought to myself this game would be impossible to do a walkthrough on. more credit to ya cowboy. you helped me get into the souls series after failing miserably at dark souls 3 i went and did all the souls borne games with the help of your walkthroughs. ive taken elden ring head on without help and im a beast at it from all youve showed me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-25,so happy to hear your voice again for this game. i don't play any souls games without your guidance. you do an amazing service for the community of players that want to enjoy these masterpieces
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-31,today march 31st 2024 my birthday. i got a ps5 and elden ring today and i am so thankful this playthrough exists otherwise i would have no idea wth to even do
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-20,"i'm being offered 300 to be in a video game study. i lied and said i love to play games. they asked, have you played elden ring? i said, yea, i love elder ring lol anyways, to be a part of the study, i said i've played over 30 hrs of this thing. now i'm trying to do a crash course of this thing. never played it. the last console i had was an n64. pray for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,"was honestly looking for someone who's actually playing a full playthrough showing routes and explaining in detail allot of things well done man. keep up the great work! i'm glad i scrolled long enough and found you, you definitely dersevlrve more publicity."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-28,just started elden ring and realized that i've been watching these walkthroughs for almost a decade now. i really appreciate your work!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,this walkthrough was the final push for me to buy elden ring. it is my first game in this series and i'm really looking forward to play it! thanks!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"cowboy my man, i cant even describe how eagerly i was waiting for this. its a big task to make as detailed walkthroughs as yours. i know for a fact that if i dont follow your walkthrough i am sure to finish the game without a lot of items and quests. keep up the good work man."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-06,just got into elden ring. i got it years ago and was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things to do. been watching you since dark souls 1 walk through. by far the best series about this on youtube. thank you cowboy edit i just beat the game yesterday. truly earned the love it received
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,i'm so impressed that you've got the the walkthrough started already. gonna go in blind first but can't wait to use this when i inevitably get lost.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,i'm at the end of my own playthrough now and cant wait to get the platinum! its always fun to follow these walkthroughs and see what i missed. i'm always suprised by the amount of effort that goes in these walkthroughs. especially now that it's open world.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-28,thank you so much for the work you put into these videos. i played elden ring when it came out for 70hrs or so and one of the biggest reasons why i stopped playing is because i just didnt know what to do next and felt lost like there was no path for me to go and too many options i just started playing it again a year later and figured i would watch your walkthrough you posting these videos helps me tremendously in progressing through the game and i cannot thank you enough! stay in good health cowboy!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-03,just got my steam deck and had to wait a fcking whole year to play this master piece. i follow you since the dark souls walkthrough and i love your content. i wish you can do another one updated with the new things they brought to. but i'm glam to see you already complete this one. thanks a lot for making these games less a pain and more an expirience.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-01,just wanted to let you know i love the content. i find these games very overwhelming so i always start but never finish. been watching these for a bit now and they have given me the confidence to get back into it!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-31,"thank you for providing so much information, insight and detail on how to understand your weapon choice, scaling, passive effects, ashes of war, guarded damage negation, one handed wielding vs two handing a weapon not to mention the very professional walkthrough and much more. this is truly a god send! i love midevil games dungeons, dragons, magic.indepth lore! and ive put about hundred hours or so trying to piece everything together and came up with nothing that made sense to me, only getting as far as liurnia of the lakes and then starting my character over to get a better build. if your walkthrough didnt exist i would not have been able to enjoy and understand or experience to the fullest what i think is probably the best game ever since skyrim and dragon age. thank you for this very thorough and indepth walkthrough. it has been very enjoyable and exciting! great work!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-06-10,"just want to thank you for this walkthrough, brand new player here. it's pretty overwhelming being killed by anything you challenge. i appreciate this and looking forward to the full walkthrough because at the end of the second episode i felt way better off in this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this is great. 100 or not, having access to a guide this early after the games launch is going to be massively beneficial for everyone struggling to find out where to go and what to do. i tend to try playing through areas and then watching your guides after so i don't get spoilers but i can find anything spicy that i missed. definitely going to do that here and try and get myself as ready as i can because i've made it to radahn and feel completely dead in the water in that fight."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-08,"i have had 1,000's of hours enjoying souls games and it all started with learning from you. sincerely thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"no way i thought you would have the walkthrough production starting in less of a week after release on such a massive game. well played my man, well played."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,yes! just finished my blind playthrough and it was a blast! feel like i missed a ton of content which is why im super happy youre doing a walkthrough for this insanley vast game. ive followed every other playthrough you made for all the souls games and its my favorite thing to do in gaming! thank you for taking the time to make these and deliver them in such an entertaining and thorough way.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-16,its been a year since we all ventured across the lands between with you holding our hand. now as a ng8 veteran i believe i speak on behalf of all the players that never played a souls game before elden. thank you cowboy! you sir are a scholar and a gentleman. we would have quit this game without u
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-29,this walkthrough is already a nostalgia
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-17,thank you so much for making this series im on my second journey and wanted to get the platinum. the game was real rough the first play through but i figured it out. glad you could help me do all the extra stuff and make me feel good. thanks again.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-29,i'm actually a 4 billion year old grandpa and i wanna thank you for your amazing walkthroughs its a ton of help !
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,did anyone else chuckle when he named his character cownoy ?
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"ohhhh shit here we go, the moment weve all been waiting for has finally come  youre honestly a god though, like i cant imagine how difficult it must be compiling all that information and then trying to guide someone through the game. i honestly dont think ive ever seen a youtuber as dedicated to their job as you are, youre actually a god."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-19,"my skills suck. this is not a game for 72 year old wannabe's. finding this walk through tutorial made all the difference. a road map, a strategy, the correct build for my skill sets made all the difference. how you approach this game and using the guidance from cowboy may make this one of the best values of entertainment out there. i still had to beat the bosses and sometimes it took me three days. however, the timing and preparation being in the right area at the best time based on your character development made it all possible. this game is like a 2000 page novel. it is yuge!. i have spent over 300 hours enjoying the adventure and cowboy has the ability to make it all very entertaining. had many good laughs along the way. thanks cowboy."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-04,how in the world would you do this with no guidance. this video is priceless thank you sooooo much
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-01,its so refreshing having someone skip the dialogue during these because now when i play the storyline is fresh thank you!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-12,your videos are the best. this is my first souls game and i am loving it. i'm 70 and have been gaming for only about 20 years. the game is hard but it's just perfect. thanks for the great walkthroughs! i'm going to restart now that i have watched your videos and can't wait to see where they take me!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-20,my first time playing 2024 summer
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-25,"started with ds1 when it came out played them all except sekiro. got elden ring as soon as it came out and hated it not an open world fan at all gave up about 8 hrs in. just finished lies of p and was hungry for more soulslike decided to reinstall elden ring but only if i could find a guide came across cowboys' youtube and wow it's been nearly a month on ep 67 right now, nearly there. maybe i'll have to give sekiro another shot since there is a walkthrough. huge thanks hope you're having a good holiday!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-02,"thanks cowboy, i'm new to this all of this, my nephew actually got it for me so it's been a steep learning curve! you sir are instrumental for this old man in learning this game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,love the walkthroughs. having more fun with this game than i thought that i would.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-24,"thank you so much for the tremendous work you put into your channel. especially this elden ring walkthrough. im not a gamer but my husband enjoys gaming and i like to watch him play. the minute i saw elden ring i was blown away and, for the first time, wanted to try for myself. you have this innate ability not to talk down to your audience and to treat everyone equally. everyone, from novices like me to highly experienced gamers, can learn and benefit from your experience, incredible skillstalent and knowledge. that is invaluable and sets you apart. it makes the journey so much more fun for your viewers, knowing you have our backs. im proud to be a member, so worth it! keep on fightin, cowboy!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-11,"i also personally recommend going the class most similar to what you want towards end game. the specific stat lineup should help more, since you hit your goalsstat wise earlier"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-13,when you don't need help but you love cowboy's content so much that you will watch a walkthrough you don't need.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,for all newbies following this walkthru. i did a strength great axe  exe great axe build and from episode 30ish onwards i was unstoppable. thank you cowboy for that guide
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-26,"love your walkthroughs cowboy. you guided me through ds2 and now although i like to make my own way into elden ring i still watch your videos to make sure i didn't miss anything. you're awesome, man, thank you for your videos!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-09,"as a newcomer i wanna say thank you! i'm on your 4th video and you are absolutely amazing! everything from explaining moves to casting to general info. you have definitely given me hope to beat and compete this game. it's my first soul's game that i'm actually progressing at, so thank you seriously!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-20,i bought the japanese version of the elden ring and i can't change the language to english...i watched this walkthrough and i think this channel gives the best walkthrough guides... bloodborne walkthrough also helped me a lot in my progress.thankyou cowboy
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-29,i really appreciate your time and effort to make this guide. i've been struggling for a week trying to learn this game and this has been a huge help.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-16,finally just started playing this and it's just such a damn masterpiece it brings a tear to my eye
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-05,just finished the walkthrough took me 89 hours give and take a couple hours of me sitting at a grace eating food. completely achievable don't be scared of any boss the walkthrough prepares you for all of them even the hardest in the game took me 5 attempts and about an hour. thx cowboy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-15,you saved me one week of trying to figure this out
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-30,"i just found out right now, if you never think to teleport back to the church to meet ranni for the spirit bell and wolf spirts. and you're finished caria manor and have started her quest... you can't get the summoning bell until after you've completed her quest...."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-17,i just wanted to say thank you so much for this walkthrough. i am following it for my second playthrough to get remaining remembrances i need for completion. this is the most comprehensive walkthrough possible and i followed it the whole way and am amazed at how close i am to completion in just one playthrough for following your guide the whole way. an absolute godsend thanks again so much!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,i appreciate the walkthrough even though some people think this is in spoiler territory i disagree this is content thats consumable and you can choose to consume it or not im actually in a place in elden ring right now where i dont know where to go next caelid seems too hard altus seems too hard so im just stuck in limbo running around in liurnia the underground and limgrave trying to get runes and get everything done so i appreciate a walkthrough that points me in the right direction for next steps
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"i'm 70 hours in, still far from completion. can't wait to go through everything again and do everything i missed once i finish the game on my own. i've never been this addicted to a game in my life."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-14,kinda crazy how you're as much a part of my souls experience as the game itself over all these years. i always find my way back to your guides.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-10,youre like the sam sulek of elden ring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-20,this is my fourth time running through this game using your walkthrough. at this point i remember it like the back of my hands but i honestly just love your commentary and guide throughout this series. thank you.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,holy shit it's happening  i'm seriously considering if i should start another character to follow along this walkthrough
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-20,i am totally new to the souls games.. some exposure to them in middle school. i am glad to see that the first boss fight is actually intended to make you die lol. i was so upset with myself
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-02,"thanks for taking the time to put this out. i used to game a lot as a kid, but, as life took over, play intermittently and casually. videos like this really help me access what is clearly an incredible yet perhaps overwhelming game for someone like me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-13,should i buy elden ring? is it a must have? i think the answer is obvious.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-06,it's my first time playing 2023
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,dont care about the stats its all about the drip if i dont look styling on these demons whats the point?
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,although i love how bloodborne and sekiro encouraged faster playstyles... i might just carry the biggest sword humanly possible and pretend i'm guts from berserk.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-05,012  hero 050  bandit 132  vagabond 220  astrologer 306  warrior 344  prisoner 425  confessor 504  prophet 549  samurai 626  wretch 717  general info on classes
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"for anyone wondering what incantations are incantations are a type of magic in elden ring. incantation spells are often dependent on the faith stat, and have a variety of effects from healing and curing status effects to conjuring fire or claws to deal damage in a wide area. incantations are cast using a sacred seal or similar catalyst. incantations in elden ring are a combination of what would be miracles and pyromancies from past souls games. you will find familiar favorites, as well as new ones.  copied from elden ring wiki"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,timestamps hero 012 bandit 050 vagabond 132 astrologer 220 warrior 306 prisoner 344 confessor 425 prophet 505 samurai 549 wretch 626
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"the magic looks fantastic, but i've never really liked using anything but melee in souls games. it's a pretty tough choice now."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,the wretch is basically the best starting class to tailor your character to how you wanna play. earlier levels can be gained pretty fast and you get the freedom to put them where you want.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"confessor seems super interesting. i've always run a knight melee build in from games, but the spells in elden ring seem like a lot of fun so i want the option to run melee and spells at the same time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"aside from the bow, the thing i like most about the bandit is the excellent shield for parrying, the dagger causes bleed, and the attacks are fast!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,i'm really liking confessor right now. makes me feel like a paladin.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i would consider the vagabond the most straightforward and easy to pick up class for newcomers. it has the best armor, 2 very good early weapons, and a shield that can block 100 physical. if you unequip one weapon andor the gauntlets you can still fast roll. a quality build is tried and true, and not so risky considering it doesn't appear easy to just hang back and fire off projectiles endlessly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"not a word about the confessor starting with the assassin's approach incantation, basically making it a stealth class in the early game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"the vagabond, confessor, or samurai sounds the way to go for me. i do like hero too though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,the samurai is probably the best class for taking down big damage sponges like bosses and giants considering it's starting weapon is the uchigatana which builds up bleed on enemies.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"going to go wretch, its the purest you can get on a first playthrough. you don't know where any items are and just got to survive and grow from nothing into the elden lord. i care more about the single player experience then pvp and can always make a dedicated pvp character later on when i've learned the nuisances of the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"every time i play a new fromsoft game, i am stuck with character archetype choice paralysis. i know in the long run it doesn't matter so much, but i still agonize over it for much, much longer than i want to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-31,in my opinion wretch is a generally good option because 1. you can get weapons and armor easily with a little bit of leg work even the stuff that the classes come with 2. your stats are fairly versatile allowing you to level up easier and meet most requirements with only a bit of work 3. this class puts you in a dangerous position always forcing you to learn danger avoidance much better in my opinion those are my 3 reasons for why you should use wretch.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"correction high endurance, not strength, is necessary for using heavier equipment while maintaining a fastmedium roll speed. strength is only necessary for weapons that require or scale with it. endurance increases stamina and equip load."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,i went the safer route and went vagabond. i didn't realize how good the starting armor was until i struggled to find things to replace it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"ill be going with the wretch the first time through. itll make discovering new loot so much more fun when you start with nothing. also, the wretch starts at level one so you can still minmax effectively enough for pvp"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-10,"i recommend the samurai, its weapon is very good for early game as ive beaten lots bosses with it and the long bow is solid if your out of heals and need to just dodge and shoot"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-26,"in the end, the class honestly doesn't matter at all. it determines how easily you go through the first few hours of gameplay...that's really it. after you get some levels and get your build started you honestly forget what class you picked anyway. i had to go on my sword caster real quick to see what class i picked for him. i picked hero, but i am an int build, and it works incredibly well, given i started with so much str and dex, adding int to that preexisting stat pool made him incredibly versatile for downtheline spell casting. for not to mention with tears, you can respec to whatever you want. this game is far more lenient when it comes to stats."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"this may be the first fromsoft game where i will consider magic as a primary focus, or at least on level with melee."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"the confessor, prophet and astrologer classes are the most attractive options to me. but i think i would have to choose the confessor. despite the confessor being skilled in stealth i would like to rather focus on magic, incantations and melee combat. being skilled in mainly using incantations but still having some degree of skill in sorcery, while also being skilled and frequently using one hander swords and spears."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,the prisoner seems fun. i like the spooky mask too.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-24,"after watching this, i am 100 doing the vagabond. i like the fact that i can use heavy armor with ease while also being a tank and dealing a good amount of damage. i honestly thought the warrior would be the same thing but i don't like the fact that it's better with duel wielding and wears light armor."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,looks like i'll start out as a prisoner. fits the type of character and play style i prefer. meleemagic combo. the bandit looks interesting too....i like the bow....
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,this was very helpful for somebody who has never played a darksouls game but was properly intrigued by this. thanks!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,"interesting options, while reading about them i found i liked confessor or samurai but after watching i liked the hero class more, not sure what ill build into yet"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"it's going to be the wrech for me, i need that emotional damage."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"magic in this game is really amazing compared to its predecessor, basically ill go with melee focus on soulsborne, but ill try hybird melee and little bit magic, confessor it is then!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"guys it's very simple to respec skills in this game. i'd just say go for any class, you'll have fun either way!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,definitely going prisoner. i want to cast magic and turn enemies into swiss cheese with pokes
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,finally getting a spellsword starting class  prisoner all the way baby
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"all shields have the same parry window, so aggressive players shouldn't shy away from massive turtle shields like in the past."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i always roll as a mage. the magic in elden ring looks insane..
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"going to go with prophet, support and assisting or killing is what i love and if i can be of use to any team or even just by myself with incantations and healing then ill be more than happy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,me knowing full well i'm picking vagabond but watching this anyway because i'm so hyped for it to come out
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,great choices! vagabond and astrologer looks good to me. prisoner too
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-07,so torn between confessor and samurai. leaning confessor because i'd like to be able to more practically build into using spells. but that samurai gear is super tempting.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,"i was stuck between prisoner and astrologist. i wanted to do the concept of lite mage, where i had some martial protection while being able to use magic. being me, i would have done astrologist, but i wanted to try prisoner because its different. also, i made the iron mask concept with one eye hole work by making the covered pink and my character's captors saw it as an evil eye"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,prisoner seems like the one for me. spell sword right away as well as the fishbowl helmet d
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,small correction boosting strength doesn't affect your load capacity.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,carry load no longer scales with strength. it scales with endurance now.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"idk about you, but ive been having a bit of a weeb moment the class i might choose is samurai. then again, any class you feel is right for you would be fine, but for me, ill carry my katanas  bow on this grueling journey through the lands between."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i want to use a halberd but also some incantations. confessor looks about right.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,i want to play around with magic in elden ring but my biggest concern is running out of mana and not having flasks to replenish. feel like im always being pigeonholed into a strvigend build
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"the magic glintblade spell that prisoner starts with is really useful for hitting enemies who like dodge or block. theyll dodge when you first cast it, but since it has a delayed effect, they wont dodge the actual attack. the delay is useful against shields because you can cast it in front of them, then circle them around so the spell is facing their back and bypasses their shield. its also great for horseback combat because you dont have to face your target when casting, just be targetlocked. be sure your enemy isnt too far away from it by the time it fires off and try to line them up so the spell doesnt miss since it fires in a straight line. lastly, the spell can be charged for increased damage, but it also increases the delay, which can be useful because if you cast an uncharged glintblade right after a fully charged one, theyll both fire off about the same time to hit an enemy twice. obviously you dont need to start as prisoner to get this spell, but its a nice class either way."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"i see that dexterity has benefits for incantations  magic cast speed, while strength doesn't give any benefit. is it more optimized to go faithdex than faithstrength ?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-28,"for anyone wanting to use incantations, here are some i reccomend getting early on flame sling, sold by brother chorynthi probably misspelled that poison mist i forgot where i got this but it'll let you cheese a late game boss and the incantation sold by the turtle at church of vows this is a healing spell that gradually heals you and any ally in the spell radius. also most of the healing spells arent worth it just use your flask"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,ill either do confessor or prophet. i cant decide for my first time playing!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"im going to be a confessor, hoping that the faith offensive skills are equal or better than pyromancies from ds3. while i play, im gonna be on the lookout for scythes. i hope there is a very grim looking scythe in this game with some cool weapon art. however, depending on if the mlgs looks better thanas good as it did in bbds3, i will be using that instead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,i love spellcastermagic classes so i'll be going with astrologer or prisoner when i get the game next week.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"worth adding in addition to sword and shield, vagabond also has a halberd."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,its the first souls game ive played and my first pick was as wretch. interesting. i also tried samurai and will probably stick with that class.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-16,tip for bandit unless you really love parrying ditch the buckler because it'll allow you to do a special quickstep move to dodge around the enemy
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,haven't done much research on spells but i've seen some lightning magic and i'd love to do a lightning swordsman build or a fire swordsman build
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,went as the samauri. that sheathed stance swipe attack is lethal
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,am i the only one feeling anxiety by not knowing which character to start with? you can easily make a case for each one of them..
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i already know what class i want to play! why can't i stop watching these?!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-22,bandit is actually really good if you want to go min max bleed build plus some scarlet rott incantations
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-07-11,"i started with wretch, it was tough but i liked the idea of starting off with noting and just looting the enemies i killed for clothes and gear."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i think you are wrong here. wretch starts off as level 1 but a vagabond for example starts from level 9. you can put your specs into a minmaxing build if you are playing wretch without much consequence and it is even better to have good starting stats across the board.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,"your clips of the bandit only showed them using their shield to block, but it's an exceptional parry shield, which combos well with the high critical damage of your dagger."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,for anyone wanting to experience something interesting should play the wretch for their first playthrough. you can only experience thus play style once imo. because after your first run you know where most the stuff is.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"i always liked playing dual wielding classes with higher armor, but i may just do a complete uturn and start with a mage."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-14,"ok i chose the warrior, aiming to be a quick hitting fighter, but i found myself putting some points into faith so i can use fire incantations while using a single longswordwith 2 hands for good damage. you can play any style you want regardless of which class you choose, but itll be a challenge to reach those points you need with some grinding"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"im gonna go for sigil and spear guy, 1. i like magic, especially fast incantation that doesnt remove short range and block, 2. spears, gotta love em"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"having recently finished ghost of tsushima, im going with samurai class."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-06,"i think that every class is fine, youll adapt to it even if its not even close to the stats you play with in other games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,as a begginer i think i'm going with the vagabond.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-23,"i am more the prisoner class type, cause i like to be both a warrior and a sorcerer at the same time and it's cool that way."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i might run 2 simultaneous builds. im thinking a guts build and a musashi build since i cant decide what my initial run will be.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-06,yea i always used melee and love the fact that with ashes of war we are able to sort of cast spells
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,"ive always had the same strategy for the souls gamesfind the biggest, heaviest, most hard hitting weapon i can possibly find, and pulverise my enemies into the ground. although i couldnt do that in sekiro and i enjoyed it just as much."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-02,"i like how most of the items that you find in chests have a message written next to them, which reads why is it always sorcery... with dejection gesture!! i know the pain....."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-28,for your first playthrough you should always pick wretch. im focusing on strength and dex until i can respec and finally choose what to specialize in. you can just make a pvp save later.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,the wertch is actually one of the best pvp build i have seen personally
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,woooooooooooo yea baby this is exactly what ive been waiting for
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-05,"however with the blood loss effect from bandit, its a really good class when higher up in the game if you like to be really hands on in gaming, like me. plus the gear you can obtain makes dodging and rolling much easier."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,the prisoner is giving me strong griffith from berserk vibes after he is imprisoned.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,and you can respec in the mirror at round table hold! its easy to miss. just go up to the mirror and examine it! its the hugging ladys room!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"definitely picking prisoner, love the design and it works perfectly with my build"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-16,"i chose samurai due to pure instincts, i just think samurais are cool, probably not my best decision as later when i start new games find better classes that suit my play style, but my main file is still up and its going great!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-27,imagine a game that blended the open world of like dark souls dragons dogma mixed with sekrios combatparrying system.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,thanks this helped me a lot
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,anyone else getting griffith vibes from the prisoner class?

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,started watching you when i was a little kid binge watching your walk throughs. im now 19 years old and its been an amazing journey with you. i would love to get a copy of elden rings because it really does look amazing because one of my all time favorite game is blood borne. also just wanted to say thank you for making my childhood man
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,i first found your channel back when re6 came out. i was like 12 or 13 but now i'm about to be a second year in college. time really flies! brad has been a comfort youtuber for me for awhile and i've been able to watch in my free time or listen while i'm studying.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"first of all, thank you for your videos, for the time you put into them for us. i found your channel in 2019 and i am really glad i did. at that moment i was into a really tough place, fighting with depression and things like this, but your videos, helped me overcome it, helped me get back on my feet. thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"i discovered brad during the last of us walkthrough, i never had a console growing up so those videos kept me sane. even now that i purchased my own consoles and everything, i still continue to watch the videos!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,i started watching you about 8 years ago. i'm in the medical field and own two businesses. i don't have a lot of time to play video games however i love watching the storyline and campaigns. it sounds kind of strange but i often watch the videos on my lunch break just to get away for a little while. thanks brad for all you do and keep up the great work.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,been watching you since the serious sam series. always have loved this channel throughout middle and high school. never stopped keeping tabs and binging a playthrough every once in a while. your part 1's have usually been a determining factor on whether or not i buy a game in most cases. thanks for the years of great content.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-26,brad i dont really care about the customization and what the character looks like also brad proceeds to customize character for 17 minutes

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"3000 man, you were hashing out the boss health so good there! those stomp shield pounds do your stamina in! its cool that you dont have to beat him to progress since this is an open world story  i admit i just need to get better in the souls style games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,the prisoner is really good because he has magic and a really good melee weapon when u upgrade it but obviously its to late for that lol found this channel way back around the last of us original play through or before that big part of my childhood and some of the most rough times at the time cant imagine the influence and closure youve given to other fans so yet again i want to give my appreciation wether u see it or not
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-16,thats crazy. i remember finding your channel back in 20132014. your content does not disappoint!keep up the great work!

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-14,the creators of this game has done such a good job at making these bosses in this game intimidating. this is the first game that i have ever played that i was legitimately afraid to face a boss.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"hey brad i was scrolling through my home page on youtube and came across your 15,000 sub video, i just wanted to say that i am amazed that you've had this channel over 11 years and are still able to bring content our way and put a smile on our faces by the end of the day"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-13,the dlc is gonna be wild!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-01,"i've heard good things about this game. the main thing i got from the review was to explore and explore so you level up. and fight the bosses when you are ready for them. now, i tend to dislike death and i might have played a bit of one of the soul rend games but i maybe got in 3 or 4 bosses before the game felt too much like a struggle for me to care to keep on trying. i know i'm a quitter and i like your attitude it is good to see many are not like me. i wish you the best in your run for the win, i hear if you try and do all the off quests and explore everywhere you will miss stuff no matter how hard you try to find everything, so again best of luck and keep searching. oh yeah and do have fun"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-08,i just started playing this game about like 3 days ago and let me tell you that brad is just a goat he beat enemies that i still cant even beat alone

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"love that he has not changed, letss explore he says, and completely misses the cave of knowledge."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-25,"please play more of the game. i was pretty amazed by that early footage that you showed of the demo. i was getting that good fantasy vibes the game definitely has potential. another reason why i want you to play the game, brad, is because you don't spend too much time idling around. it's just the nice blend of action, story, and customization of the game that made me watch your playthrough. and i found your channel around 20172018."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,theradbrad i would loveeee a full play through of this one! i love how much you appreciate video games and would really enjoy getting to watch your experience with this what seems to be a current front runner for game of the year nominee or perhaps winner.

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-29,"i know you've already finished this game by this point, but awesome first part of elden ring. watching the elden ring walkthrough via you, brad, for the first time. and so far, despite how boring  challengingly difficult for most folks, this is a pretty incredible  a beautiful yet epic challenging fun video game! bandai namco really did a form of next generation style, yet the same type, dark souls game with this one, and i honestly love it. i've seen shared videos of other people playing this game back on twitter. both showing of their skills  even being funny through it due to some glitches it had at the time. seeing as by this point you're finished with this game, i felt like watching you play it to see how you gotten through it. and this isn't even your very first rpg soul themed game that i've seen you played before in the past. at least for me since my first time i've seen you play a soul game was your discontinued code vein playthrough 3 years ago. but this is your very first soul game that you're playing so far this year of 2022, so that's worth saying there! glad i decided to watch your now currently finished gameplay of elden ring, brad. real exciting to watch this playthrough of yours first hand! and it's even the bestselling game of this year as well. who knows, though? it'll probably even be the best game of the year to be awarded at some point later this year  months later. just gotta wait  see to find out for use. and if it doesn't get nominated or rewarded, we'll still consider it the best game ever seen  played. boring  annoying at times, but fun to play in having all the action, meeting the characters, exploring the world, battling through the difficult challenges  bosses of this game. everything elden ring has is something worth admiring since their first dark souls games they've created years ago. thank you bandai namco entertainment in giving us a next gen souls game of 2022 that we all can get  play for ourselves to experience  give us one worthy challenge in which this game has to offer. as usual, though not important, i'm behind still on my end on this day of your first part of elden ring, but i'm getting there. so don't worry. while slow i am, i'm still catching up! amazing  good game on your first part of your elden ring walkthroughgameplayplaythrough, brad. from start to end, and maybe even some extras from you on this game too, going to enjoy the comedy humor  what you've been up to as well of your commentary throughout this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-02-24,"started watching you since your original upload of silent hill downpour, and you've been my favorite game walkthrougher since! i think i like bloodborne like most do, just a whole aesthetic that appeals to me completely. hope to see you continue elden ring here fully!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,elden ring roguelike hero extraction shooter very interesting concept but i feel like this could be a modedlc as opposed to a stand alone title. like im sure someone could just make this as a free mod for base er.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,a parry style like sekiro would be so coooool
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"it looks absolutely awful and is a shame for souls like games and from software. no new maps to explore, no new bosses, no new weapons. just recycle reused content from previous games. same business model that cod has. truly disappointing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"thanks for subbing ,i been following your channel for years,a,also a subscriber to your channel,keep up the good work"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,visit httpshelixsleep.comtulokmango to get 20 off sitewide! thank you helixsleep for sponsoring!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"you mentioned bicycles in bloodborne, and now im imagining ludwig, the holy blade on one of the pennyfarthings and i hate it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,i would play the hell out of a weird west bloodbourne
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i did , if fact, watch the demons holes video. it was a romp"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"from someone at home who put 100 hours of this game cooping as a lionel build it is fortunately really easy to upgrade at home! if you're not hidebound to specifically the exact things the npc uses such as for a challenge like this. examples include  ditch rancorcall for the vastly superior ancient death rancor this requires a decent bit of intfaith and killing the liurnia death rite bird, but its really hard to overstate how much better this is than rancorcall. and how much funnier, too, i've seen people stunlock malenia in coop for like a solid 1015 seconds straight from halfway across the arena  infuse the great epee with cold. it has similar buildup to a greatsword so repeating thust applies it almost instantly if it hits and makes everything else hit harder, and there's a lot of room for dex and int here anyways  since you'd need 24 faith to use ancient death rancor anyways, slap a golden order seal on, add 1 more faith, and now you have access to golden vow. and blessing's boon, too, even. together with the heavy armor you get some of the best defense the game has on offer"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"finally, a video where he can be armored to the core"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"1453 ive heard spicy workers argue more for pure decriminalization, because with regulations police could still take advantage of them and abuse them like they currently do"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"242 there's a bar in my city called bicycle face, and after googling them to see what their deal was i was delighted to learn that that was a very real medical condition that would happen to a woman's face due to the speed of her traveling on a bicycle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,breaking local elden ring creator tulok doesn't want to use the spell in the build! setting the stage for a successful run
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,you're cooking with the cowboy bloodborne 2 idea. i think instead of a horse our hunter should be afflicted with the beastial curse and so to move quickly we turn into a lycan. in lycan form have a status meter like when you are successfully poisoned appear. if you don't chose to turn back before that meter drains you automatically lose lost yourself your beastial nature. maybe higher blood tinge or something makes the meter drain slower allowing for more use of the lycan form. werewolf cowboy fight eldritch horrors sounds insane enough to be awesome to me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,desert bicycle bloodborne
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,weird west is a game with cowboy and eldritch horror. that's a rootin tootin cthulhu if i've ever seen one.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"you know this is the second time i have heard about wild west bloodborne ii, and i still absolutely adore the idea. the train level idea in particular was inspired, and its not just because i love trains. now i just want to know a train themed train level would be like."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,you really manage to point out little things that make the game better. never really cared for lionel and now he seems like the most wholesome character in er.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i actually did watch the moonlight sword run happy to see it hit the same view count average as your more recent videos! you're doing awesome man, thanks for the fun times"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,a eldritch wild west game in general sounds like a super fun time honestly
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"it's kind of funny that they call it an epee anyways. because like, the term epee specifically applies to a type of sword used in sports fencing. it's not technically a weapon, and the blade would not be sharpened. it's of course based on a real weapon, but that doesn't make them the same thing one is designed to kill, one is designed to be safe for your opponent. trying to fight someone with an epee would make about as much sense as using a tennis bat  you might be able to inflict some pain, but it's really not going to work well. i'm guessing it's maybe a localization problem  in certain languages, the term for the sporting equipment is the same as for the historical weapon it is based on, i.e. in german, where either are referred to as degen. i could see japanese having a simular thing going on. on the other hand, the localization team might just have found itself challenged by a really stupid translation issue  the type of sword that the epee is supposed to represent in fencing is called a smallsword. having a great smallsword would admittedly have sounded rather silly  maybe they could have done great rapier. i think court sword was also used as an alternative name for small swords, which might have worked."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"you joke about errand buddies but legitimately, my favorite perk of being in a fully remote job is being my wife's errand buddy. whether it's her seemingly daily trips to the library, going to lunch, or picking up kids from school, we basically go everywhere together. i started working remotely in 2019 and i genuinely hope to never go back to an office."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"love your stuff man! my two cents? i think your next run should be what makes it fun for you. your favorite weapons, aows, drip, and all that. take care friend and hope you have a fantastic week!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,i literally love coming home from lab at college to eat lunch and watch your videos !
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"thank you for the media literacy essays. i fail to put into words my feelings, and hearing yours leads me to feel validated, understood really. fia was my favorite npc and i even did a fia run. dual shotels was actually not bad with a multi hit build. i'm here for the lovers out there as i am quite scared of people. sometimes i'd ask fia for a hug when i needed one in my own life."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,the mental image of a bloodborne hunter struggling to get on top of his bicycle with one giant front wheel and tiny back wheel.... priceless.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i love the eppe long poke, great distance closer, feints, infusable, pretty"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,my defense of eepy yes i am an adult but i am clinging to every scrap of whimsy i can get my hands on these days and eepy makes me smile. i rest my case.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,as soon as i saw the video title i immediately thought huh he's probably not gonna use the spells and well i can see i was right.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"ok, i get that this is fully a different thing, but if anyone is into tabletop games, the podcast friends at the table did an actual play that is very gothic horror with eldritch trains. i'm not really a big actual play person, but it's very good."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,330 cowboys fighting eldritch horrors while riding a penny farthing would be game of the year
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"media literacy particularly spicy today, thanks as ever for the righteous rage"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,the whole bb2 pitch all i could think was how impossible it would be to ride a old school bike in the desert...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"there's something about this video that feels more relaxed, and i have to say power to you. and it's pronounced epipens? ooohhhh, get fucked. epipens. when people started eating tide pods, i clawed my way outta that shit. fuck. epipens."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,217 do you want bonewheels in bloodborne?! this is how you get bonewheels in bloodborn.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,it feels kinda right for the last boss fight of the lionel run to be the one that makes the duskborn ending possible.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,blood! borne! bicycles!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i remember that study at 2401 i don't think any researcher could've predicted that result.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,lionel absolutely does not go brrr
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,me looking for something to have on in the background while i draw a drunk oppossum rambling about the importance of solidarity in the workplace. tulok there's no doubt...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"even bored to audible tears, tulok shepherds me through 30 minutes on the bike i did not want to experience. thanks! also, media literacy was brilliant. also, i love that sword because the lunging thrusty aow feels like im punching my monitor and the mobs are feeling it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"tulok is, tulok is, tulok is the perrrrrrfeeeeect channel!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"rootin tootin cowboy action with eldritch horror, you say? evil west"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"there is something cutesy about a guy wearing one of the heavyest weapons in the game, one that have the appearance of a fat guy, tht also uses a dex. weapon with a agile ash of war. and also cast random stuff to boot. also, i know the corpses you loot stuff are all the same, but it's even neater to think a very skinny guy is actually inside that heavy armor doing agile things, makes it even cutier. as forrest gump would say, he is like a box of chocolates, full of surprises."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i love using eepy around like, office worker masculine men kinda people. lots of varied reactions!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,heavy thrusting swords are low key among the best weapon classes in the game. can't wait for gaius' run one day.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"dude i felt so called out at 2800, literally the only fast food right by my house in indiana is a shitty mcdonalds, a shitty dairy queen, and one of the lowest rated taco bells ive ever seen"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"phil wants an eldritch horror western? sounds like somebody hasn't played blood west... granted, it's more a stealth game than an action game, but hey, at least it exists!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i listen to your videos while playing my own games or working, and sometimes your conversations get so real i forget im watching a rage simulator challenge run. i love it so much, keep up the good work"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"2640 as always, the church will never relinquish control of anything it is not forced to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,here's an idea for a video series in the future. a patches run in each game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"ngl i don't care if there's no challenge except for 3 bosses over and over, i just wanna hear a guy i like talking over a game i like."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"don't be d, he sucks! most universally agreeable thing ever said on this channel! and not for lack of competition!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,when tulok brought up his idea for bloodborne 2 i was really confused for a second because i misheard bicycles as icycles and was left wondering 1 how those would work as a means of transportation 2 what they had to do with bloodborne thematically
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,theres a difference between being tired and eepy and you goddam know it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,630 i like to parry the onyx lord
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"one of my favorite parts about being unemployed was that i could just be wherever, whenever, for whomever. i was the errand buddy and it was a glorious few weeks. support ubi so your lowambition friends can also be errand buddies."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,respectable lack of cockshame exhibited in the ad. great work phil
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,eldritch horror in the desert? welcome to nightvale
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,wait a riding a powderkeg style smokebelching motercycle around the streets of yharnam would actually go so crazy tho
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,given your sponsor i'm surprised you didn't go for great eepy . great video
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i didn't care when he bashed spells, i could take the shots tanken at eleanora's polearm. but the great epee too!?! now this hurts, i can't he's wrong, but it still hurts"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,i used to play rhe hell out of a ttrpg called deadlands that was basically western bloodborne.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,sounds like tulok would love a western style ghost of tsushima
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"judging by the video length, lionel is the goat"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,remnant from the ashes and its sequels are pretty close to the cowboy eldritch horror your looking for. its more ww2 weaponry as per the era but like it is not hard to cosplay a cowboy. you even get to fight a creature mentioned in lovecraft lore
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"great epee is my nickname edit i do the baby talk thing because i still have whimsy in my life and with chronic pain, it's nice to hold on to something like that"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,phil probably spit out the best bloodborne 2 idea i've heard since i started playing these games back in 2021. give me my bicycle eldritch horror michael
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"622 but phil, impaling thrust! honestly though impaling thrust is nutty strong for breaking stance"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,sayinf the title of this video while drunk got a good few minutes of laughs out of me
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i'd run errands with you tulok, but i'm painfully unemployeddisabled, and crazy depressed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"okay, i don't know why, but when you were going down the elevator to the crystal tunnel i expected the stream to cut out. guess i was thinking that somehow you were using a phone and going underground would cut the signal off. ...i'm exhausted, very clearly. also, spaghetti western bloodborne sounds amazing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"2241 the wroter definitely carefully chose bogart's lines, they made a character that has been to prison talk like he's recently been to prison. the word 'bitch' in prison is used to describe someone weak, for instance, someone who gets something stolen and can't get it back. rya got her necklace stolen and couldn't get it back, meaning to the guy that's canonically been to prison, she's a bitch. weirdly enough, words can have multiple meanings."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"tulok if you want an eldritch themed cowboy game i think evil west is pretty good, but its more comedic than bloodborne is"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,he's dummy thiccc  you know i must agree
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i also want cowboy bloodborne. open world cowboy horror with a horse??
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,wild west bloodborne would go insanely hard
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i never got the chance to play bloodbourne i would love to see more of it please do another video on it tulok i am begging
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"stephen king's dark tower series and the deadlands ttrpg i would call 'dark fantasy', not so much 'horror'. does genuine cowboy 'horror' exist, outside of maybe the tremors 4 movie?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,the wild west bloodborne idea sounds like dark watch.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"i know he said he didn't care, but it's pronounced epee"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i am sure you know this but i will say it just in case. if you use the tower of return in the weeping peninsula you can get to lyndell early. with the use of the taunters tongue you can into the capital early for gear hunting. great video, thanks for making them."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"eldritch train seems badass, but id probably prefer a tail to engine run, with the boss as the engine"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"k, i adore the bicycle proposal. maybe go with a proper penny farthing or something."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"sorry that lionnel turned out to be bad and unfun. at least the jarwright puppet remains useful, that wonderful little weirdo."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"phil spittin straight facts on the eldritch cowboys idea, absolute fire something wicked this way rides"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,i want an eldritch horror cowboy game  guy who should play more weird west ttrpgs
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"fia's ending is my favorite personally, it may be the less cynical one."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,i actually need a soulslike that has a train level i would give anything
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,regarding the for biden land in this episode i'm in australia and spicy work is legal and regulated the only illegal thing about it is you're not allowed to organise it with randoms in public
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,he can actually speak french better than most frenchmen
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"now, there's one thing i feel like i need to point out regarding your media literacy section because it kind of matters those who live in death are associated with carrying deathroot. tibia mariners, cemetary shades, ghostrite birds, the whole lot. it's heavily implied that they were even created, first and foremost, by the death of godwyn's soul in the knight of the black knives or maybe rather, the undeath of his body. the deathroot are the fragments of the great rune of death  the very thing marika had removed from the elden ring to render the gods immortal, which was stolen by ranni and the black knives in order to kill godwyn's soul and ranni's body, an act which created the cursemark of death. malikethgurranq is literally trying to collect all of the deathroot in order to monopolize death again and d is his follower  he hunts the dead to collect deathroot. so when you say that those who live in death would not pose a danger to the golden order, you are wrong  even if they aren't actively gunning for it, they collectively carry the power to kill a god, to fully uplift the order of things. by the standards of the golden order, they are incredibly dangerous  possibly the second most dangerous thing in existence, right after the flame of frenzy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,if you like board games than shadow of brimstone sounds like itll hit that eldritch horror cowboy itch. dnd esq game. its awesome.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"2500 spicy workers definitely need a union... in elden ring ofc, no relation to reallife, what so ever"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"personally, i have seen a rootin tootin cowboy shootin game with a bit of eldritch horror. at least as far as style and weapons goes. it was called remnant from the ashes. severe lack of fucked up trains, though, i will admit."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,746 us army after pearl harbor
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,i know that you need to separate the art from the artist but garden of eyes is such a scumbag that a can't enjoy any of his mods
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,"now that i think about it, having ash williams in elder ring would be really sick xd"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,the dragons better be skinned into a10 warthogs or i want my money back
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,this looks like it is straight out of a fever dream
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,unfortunately garden of eyes is pretty crappy and im almost certain the majority of this mod is created from other creators code as ive seen that jet mod before and it wansnt goes mod
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,awesome that you have the sauron 14 statue by prime 1 studio!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,you really shouldn't support garden of eyes
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,"the stat distribution is on purpose for a reason. this is a niche build where the stats wont help as much leading to an unconventional stat distribution that is triggering a lot of people lol. vigor above 60 is a waste. mind you don't need it, the skill cast of the weapon lasts 1 minute per. endurance, if you are using rakshasa for more damage, you don't need it. if you are using the lighter build, it a preference to push to a heavier build and pump endurance. the skill only scales with int and weapon lvl, leveling dex and or str is a waste. you don't need dex for casting, azure staff will do the job fine. you are not using faith to cast buffs since it would lead to offhanding two things and being obnoxious. the logical answer is 99 intelligence for slightly more damage, why not."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,everyone has a plan until the boss starts doing random bullshit.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-29,ight how long is this gonna take to get these items 125 hours
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,it gets a lot harder when the boss isn't standing in place.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"bro ain't cooking, he made a glass cannon that kills itself"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-02,now just dont get hit
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-30,dont let him cook ever again
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-04,the dancing lion didnt even let me use my mimic before fucking me up
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-03,fantastic. now you have 3 seconds attack window before those shit wore off
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-04,bloodsucking and red feather? oof. a talisman thats constantly draining your hp and a talisman whose effects only activate when you are below 20 hp? the others were right. dont try to cook ever again.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,"no no no please, please if anyone is gonna use this build, please know how to dodge! i dont wanna be summoned and returned back to my world in less than 15 seconds"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-12,"excuse me, sir, will you stand on the x here while i spend a minute or 2 making a few adjustments to this thing that definitely isn't the front end of my cannon? thanks."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,the avarage im scared of confrontation in a confrontational game build
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,"1. redfeathered branchsword and bloodsucking cracked tear aren't a good pair because you need to be below 20 hp for the talisman to activate and the bloodsucking cracked tear is constantly draining your health, you will have to repeatedly heal as to not die but then reach 20 hp again to active the talisman again edit i suggest using either one or the other 2. azurs staff uses 20 more fp to cast any sorcery, use a normal staff instead"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-05,"bold of you to assume we all have a magic scorpian charm, and therefore helped selivus with his puppet fetish."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-14,2 of your talismans arent doing a single damn thing bro what
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-16,wait until he hears about diminishing returns past 250
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-07,"boss standing there like hold on, let him cook"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-01,"hey boss, i need you to stand still while i throw pots at you and cast these buff spells"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-03,godfrey not even gon let me stand for 2 seconds
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,you forgot the most important thing. must have 2k hours of gameplay and knows each bosses moveset blindfolded.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-31,then dies within the first hit
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-29,"for new players step 1 spend hours finishing the ranni quest to make this build step 2 panic during boss fights, give up all hope, smash your controller then make a blasphemous blade build im kidding btw please do your best"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-05,"a crystal tear that constantly drains your hp, and a talisman that activates only if you have less than 20 hp i think this is wrong, not to mention that he must know every attack pattern of the enemy, because with that armor he carries, plus the magic scorpion talisman  goodbye defense, one hit and you are on the ground, plus terra magica forces you to stay in the area where you cast it. that build is not constant, i would take off the redfheater branchsword talisman, for the ritual sword talisman and instead of the bloodsuckin tear, i would use the one that regenerates stamina faster like greenburst crystal tear, since the charged attacks consume a lot of stamina, it does less damage yes, but it is much more consistent"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"you know, if bosses aren't moving, it's completely makes no obligation to do all it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-11,"have boss stand still and comatose for infinity damage. oh, and change the recomended armor at the end for the hell of it  priceless."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,me spams blasphemous blade and chuggs flasks
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-03,that's not 400 it's 172 damage boost you
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,dark moon great sword is just insane
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-10,"throws first pot  why has the boss already hit me twice through my buffing process? hmm shrine or grace, which one too choose?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-30,you can also use bloods exaltation varre mask  sacred bloody flesh  rot exaltation poison hand but that might just be overkill
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-03,any sword 25 with the carian sovereignty ash of war is probably a better option for the main weapon
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-15,all while the boss just stands there and lets you get ready
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-02,"fun fact the commander's standard dropped by commander o'neil is basically a direct upgrade to golden vow, giving more damage and damage reduction"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-07,you can get more with rannis dark moon and using lusats if you're going pure damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-31,i like to actually play the game rather than buff for 7 hours
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,the plan is perfect untill the boss starts moving and tweaking out around the whole arena
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-31,could do 10 more damage if you use ranni's dark moon or renalla's full moon
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-05,swap either bloodsucking or branch sword and also equip jelly fish icon for extra dmg its a good pair with dark moon greatsword
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,"yo alexanders shard doesnt work on the projectiles when you buff the dark moon great sword. ironically, godfrey's icon isnt supposed to work but since the projectiles are the bi product of a charged attack or something it works. and another comment already said, but bloodsucking tear and red feather talisman aint gonna work really, good video regardless"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,its always very sus when someone puts red feather sword there cuz the boss will 1shot you and then you spend another minute buffing up to yet again get 1shot
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"with howl of shibriri and the armor set, i bet u get one shot by almost all things when the buffs are active"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-30,"boss not standing around while you do all that, bro."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,ngl all that buffing to get two shotted is crazy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,"so you have red feathered branchsword which means you have to be almost dead, then bloodsucking tear which does damage over time? so you have like 4 seconds to kill the boss and not get hit a single time?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-30,you do all that shit but at the end you get blitzed by enemies who move as fast as shit
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-17,"buffs aren't additive in elden ring, but multiplicative basically if you buff yourself of 20 with golden vow the magic bloodsucking crack tear will only buff 20 of the remaining 80 which would only result in a 15 buff and so on, the more you buff stack, the less powerful the buffs become, so it's not a 400 damage buff, and you'd also get oneshotted, but if you're good enough this build actually works"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,"build an elden ring are like cooking and following recipe instructions, sometimes you can follow the instructions or you can find your own way and it usually ends up so much better."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-11,build sounds like a chore to maximize
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,death rancor and the marais executioner with all the multihit buffs is insanity!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-31,i did fine with bloodhound blade and blood flame.. beat every boss with it. i tried others but man that sword is too good
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,"i swear to god every single thing i do fucks up the ranni quest dont talk to blaidd at night, rannis gone, not starting her quest before the fire giant, rannis gone, dont have three friends for a barbecue on 10 am on a monday of september, rannis fucking gine"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,hear me out no. that was just awful. youre making a setup that cant take one hit from literally any boss and if u do take one your scrambling to heal as your health drains faster then rot. but if your in to the glassiest canon that has one trick hey thats your choice. 60 vig is vital to not get one shot btw on literally over half the dlc not even just bosses but no name bosses can still do 1900 on tree frag 5 your just being misleading  just wanted to help the new players avoid u lol question. how many hrs do u have. ik its over 500 and probably 3 or 4 play throughs so make content for people whos not balls deep in doge knowledge.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"my build blasphemous. crucible knight armor and one of the hoods. stats 54 vig 30mind endenough to wear armor, blasphemous, golden shield, erdtree seal and giants seal and not fatroll. 30 str 40 dex 80 faith intenough to cast discs spells giantflame, flame fall upon them, golden vow, flame grant me strength, boulder, lightning spear, discs. talismans godfrey icon, turtle talisman, flame scorpion, radagon icon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,swap out the helmet for the witch hat which further boost the frost dmg
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-19,its not a build its a gamble
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,personally id use the jellyfish shield cause its one of the only weapons to benefit off of it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,"meanwhile, the boss has already taken care of john eldenring and is now enjoying a cup of tea"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-28,bruh my friend called me a gold digger because i married ranni for her sword. i would have been more faithful but i discovered that her original body was ginger.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-24,this works really well on all the bosses that dont move or attack you.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,or u could just get good
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,by the time you finish buffing the boss is over your shit and will rng you so hard
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,"by the time you get all those buffs down you're gonna get like 1 attack in before you need to rebuff. i'm good with just the blue dancer charm, that red father charm, a light strength scaling weapon, and determination aow"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"this is what happens when you let bro cook, you end up with a hunk of charcoal"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,yea just let the enemy know you need to prepare. to spare you a minute
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-14,you can sub out the magic scorpion with axe talisman if youre gonna charge heavy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-24,you could most likely switch out the helmet for the witch hat and instead of golden vow use commander standard. it also makes the damage increase you take from howl of shibriri down to 0 while still getting a 40 increase in damage from using howl whereas if you use golden vow you take 5 more damage with only a 35 increase in damage output. other than that it's solid.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,brother the darkmoon greatsword inflicts frostbite
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,"an improved build would be to change out the bloodsucking tear, rakshasa set and feathered branchsword. get charged attack tear, and replace the branchsword with the ritual sword talisman. it's less damage, but it's way harder to die now."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-04,you forget the possibility to hot swap some talismans for some extra special buffs.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-29,dang if only the boss actually stand still for u to be able to do all of that
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-24,"i like how you got the lion to sit still for all that. mine kills me at the door. like literally, i walked in the door and it killed me in the door as i was walking in. i was at least able to get my runes outside the door to say f that and deal with it later."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"mines different. i use the staff of the great beyond since you can cast both incantations and sorceries with it, i use all the exultation talismans aged one, kindred of rot, and lord of bloods while wearing this armor. use fetid pots to poison yourself to trigger the rot exultation, sepukku for blood exultation triggering and frenzied flame spells to cause yourself madness for the aged ones exultation talisman to trigger. you could also throw the rot feathered sword insignia for low hp attack boost youre buffed to the hills at that point. a glass cannon yes but buffed like no tomorrow. makes you learn how to dodge very well"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-17,"much better to use an exultation talisman instead of red feather, like lord of bloods or something, also with dmgs you can have jellyfish shield buff in offhand since you only need to 1hand dmgs to swing heavy attacks"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-21,now if only i can get the divine dancing beast to stand still in front of me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-26,it's not anime where the boss is waiting for you to transform
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,so what happens when the boss doesnt stand there and let you do all this?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-02,"would be easier for the spells and buffs to just use the staff of the greater beyond, can use both spells and incantations with this one"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-25,"i've been running dmgs on my main build, you really only need the 3 main talismans that buff the skill, magic scorpion alex and godfrey, the last slot is best used with the greatshield talisman to offset the def drop from msc. terra magica does buff dmgs damage but it's optional at best, you will be moving too much to stay in range of it u less you have a summon or spirit that can reliably grab and maintain aggro. any other buffs like golden vow or whatever else are nice but you really don't need them. for another build sure but if you're just focussing on dmgs, it's really quite powerful without them especially when it procs freeze. if anything i would say carry a couple fire pots or some other method of quick fire damage to reset and reapply freeze also, use a shield, the dmgs energy wave does the same amount of famage whether or not you two hand it, so watch your stamina and keep your guard ready!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"add 4 exultations to this, drake shield, squid shield, respective madness and sleep offhands. cheers"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-15,"or, you could replace the entire rakshasa's set with the spellblade set which boosts all magic despite the description specifying it only boosts spells, and swap out the red branch feather talisman for the ritual sword talisman so you can have a similar boost at full hp rather than having 20hp remaining. or you use the uplifting aromatic, terra magica, magic scorpion, shard of alexander, twohanded sword talisman for twohanding any weapon and then use the godfrey icon setup. i also recommend two handing the sword for the aforementioned talisman"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,you would squeeze even more damage out of an attack with this build hitting with both the projectile from the skill as well as the charged attack itself!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,that should be next souls series boss interaction. the boss will spawn at random in a certain area while you have to do somwthing so you can just pre buff and 1 shot mfers
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-11,i guess its a good idea unless youre on the dancing lion because he wont stand there and take it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,just make sure the boss knows to stand still while you throw pots and buff up
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,player buffing behind boss fog wall. boss are you done yet?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-04,brother aint nobody doing this lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,should wear spell blades set if youre trying to get the dark moon buffed more.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-08,even the wind will knock this dude out
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-29,by the time youve casted all those buffs that lion would have hit you 30 times
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-02,i would love to see my man try this build on consort radahn.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-13,step 1 beat margit
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,mmhhhmmmm puts onion armour on
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-19,"yeah, sure, the boss should say,  take you're time bro no hurry, we got all day"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,good luck with golden hippo ... charging you before even summoning ...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,im sure the boss will let me buff and cast all that and fully charge my heavy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-11,instructions unclear. i've got eaten by the lion. now he's selling my elden ring copy and my ps 5 on ebay.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-03,skills are the best extra dammage dammage you can get in elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-14,works great for bosses who wait for you to be ready.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-04,"bro didn't even get to bleed poison madness and sleep exultations, imagine"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this episode focuses on a starting loop through the initial zone picking up key items like seeds and sacred tears to give you more and stronger healing, obtaining your mixed physick, a lantern to help lighten darker areas, and a brief farming tutorial. key items include the sacred blade ash of war for catacombs, the bloodhound's fang, the quality starter weapon, and flames of frenzy, my suggested damage dealing faith spell. i know we're moving fast and we have one more of things going quickly before we slow down so watch at 12 speed if you need!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"found your voice really familiar, went back through your old playlists and realized i watched your entire ds2 original walkthrough, back then i was so young that i didnt know what the hell i was doing in the new game my parents had gotten me that i had never heard of and didnt even know where to go. you were the only reason i even beat the game, and now, almost a decade later, i found my way back to your videos! keep doing such a great job, my friend! youre really helpful, even if now i finally know what im doing, at least most of the time! great video!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-19,im a casual gamer that has struggled but persisted with elden ring for a long time. finally broke down and went to youtube and im enjoying your walk through so much.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-12,"not only is this useful content, it's enjoyable to watch. i've played 20 hours and realized i suck horribly i'm 53, and it's my first fromgames title, and my reflexes are capped by life's level design. this helps me explore and build a better character, and i'm free to get on or off the path as i like. this is the content that's making me patient for the design, and enabling me to actually enjoy the game. i would be lost and avoiding all bosses were it not for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-23,"i was super lost while playing this game, and i didnt know what or where to go all i knew back then was to follow grace but that led me immediately to a boss battle where i keep dying, fortunately a good friend of mine showed me your video and my goodness you are a life saver. this is my first time playing a game that does not have any difficulty setting and only has super duper hard mode on, which made me want to cry due to the amount of times ive been thrown around like a rag doll. i cannot express how grateful i am to you, because you make this game somewhat easier to navigate, play, and youre like a big brother guiding his noob sibling in a game youve pretty much dedicated your time to, so thank you sir. now i have some mini goal before i reach my big goal which is to be elden lord, wish me luck!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-12,"i followed your ds2, ds3, sekiro, and now i feel i know you in a weird way. these games are hard and this one is especially intimidating but as soon as i hear cowboy here i get a level of comfort that comes over me. thank you for your voice and help throughout the years."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-17,"this game is absurdly large. with no real direction on where to go or what to do, i find myself aimlessly wandering for hours. following your walkthrough gives it a semblance of order. i appreciate the hard work and long hours you put in for us cowboy. hope you hit 1 million subs soon. i'm sure you will."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,be careful with some poison things on the ground me proceeds to step on every and each one of them
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"your walk throughs have significantly helped me in this game, i was completely lost at first. started a whole new game and i am already further than i was in 50 hours previously"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-06,"honestly this series has become my comfort series, i love to have it play in the background when i'm farming in other games. the combo of the music from the game and cowboy's narration is just so soothing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-26,i know this was made awhile ago but bravo man. the fact you do this walkthrough with a melee build but get things for other builds is just amazing. awesome vids and helped me tremendously
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-09,"15h in, look at this walkthrough to see if i missed anything, cowboy at his first 30 minutes and already in an area i've never seen, absolute legend. its like i'm watching a different game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-13,cant tell you enough how lost ive been and how much ive wanted to like this game. these walkthroughs have made such a difference. i love it now. im not dying every 3 minutes. thank you for your hard work cowboy! love your show!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"best fromsoft walkthroughs ever come from cowboy! thank you for giving us quality content and helping the newer and less experienced like myself lol. i never would've made it through sekiro or bloodbourne without those guides, salute!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-01,"out of all the guides and follow throughs ive found for this game, i, as well as everyone in the comments know there are tons of them out there yours is by far and its not even close, to me is by far the most comprehensive, well put together, detailed and precise one ive found. i dont even bother trying to see if theres something better in comparison. for one, im sold on yours and two, its a waste of time shopping now. ive found what i was looking for and im satisfied. i appreciate and admire your hard work because i know its not easy and you wouldnt be doing what you do if it wasnt for your love and respect for the community. thanks cowboy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-01,found you years ago when i had decided to play dark souls bc of how hard i heard it was. played it a little while and i just wasn't getting it for some reason so i looked a guide up online and it was yours. watched it and couldn't figure out how you just smashed the bosses but you got me through it and i fell in love with it. played a second play through and all of a sudden i was smashing everything and everything just finally came together. so when elden ring came out i was determined to beat 2 and 3 before i played it. so i went through both of those and then elden ring without looking anything up. well fast forward two years and i decide to get ready for the dlc and low and behold my save file has disappeared. had a couple 100 hours in it too. man elden ring is a huge time investment exploring without any help. makes the game one of the best of all time though. but alas i don't have the time anymore for that kind of investment so here i am and you're still doing it. great guide man.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"absolutely incredible that ive been at this game for 35 hours at this point trying to explore as much as i can, and yet i watch this walkthrough of the starting area gobsmacked at what i missed. getting that stamina ring pronto."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"it literally feels like a eternity waiting for these lol playing alongside.. seriously brother, thank you so much for all of this hard work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-08,don't forget to to grab the flame crest wooden shield at 2750 in the house just past the bonfire  the gilded iron shield  2x blood grease in the graveyard at 2940
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"your guides got me through dark souls remastered, dark souls iii and sekiro. can't wait to go on this journey with you again cowboy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,i dont know if anyone else knew this but you can drop rainbow stones off long drops and if it shatters that means its deep enough to kill you.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"im just past the fourth story boss, but im watching these to make sure i havent missed anything. i learned a few things i was unaware of, thank you! this game is amazing, its already my favorite. its like combining skyrims exploration, with the souls formula. 1010 and im nowhere near finishing. already planning multiple playthroughs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-07-13,"i tried to explore the game myself at first because in every dark souls game i immediately followed the walkthrough, but i was so lost and underleveled anywhere. now i am happily following a walkthrough again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-20,"this is my first souls game, i did a little by myself mostly farming the gatehouse ruins before finding this walkthrough and its taken me 5 hours of play to get to the end of this video. i was so happy to kill my first boss."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,listen cowboy from the bottom of my heart and soul. you are a god send content creator. your walkthroughs and lets play videos are second to none. you are single handly the best youtuber who gives quality content thats beneficial to any type of gamer. i wish you continoues success and i cant wait to follow along with you in this playthrough series.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"brand new to these games. never played any of them in my life, theres a weird stigma to games this intimidating. at first i almost gave up bc i was overwhelmed at everything. now i am falling in love with this game, thanks to your walkthrough. seriously appreciate it. and once i finish, ill have to check out your walkthroughs for other fromsoft games. you got my support"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-16,"minor note. when you get to the weeping peninsula se grace. if you pop up the hill there's an easy puzzle tower for an extra memory stone. and if you do a bit of parkour, you can get the tortoise shell shield which comes with the barricade shield ability on it. this shield is extraordinarily good throughout the early game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-06,it's so cool being about 20 hours into the game and going back and watching another playthrough. i followed along with a guide that essentially spent 23 hours getting a good weapon and somber smithing stones 19 so you're superop early in the game. my next playthrough will for sure be much more like this
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-19,these videos are a lifesaver. had no idea how to play this game. its fairly impenetrable with no guidance
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-01,"so far, i'm making steady progress in the game due to your walkthrough. thank you so much for making these videos. i would have no idea where to go or what to do in elden ring without them."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,this walkthrough is actually one of the most optimal paths in playing elden ring. loved it!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"1032 from that grace, change time to night. the go back to the bridge and a op black knight will show, go up the hill and make sure he follows, he will get poisoned and die before reaching the top. he drops like 40k runes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-16,merci ! thx for the incredible work. your discord is equally awesome
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,i used your guides to get 100 completion and all achievements on xbox. here i am again following them for my pc playthrough. cheers and thanks again for the great guides!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,it's really cool to see the guide coming to fruition piece by piece. keep it up.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"love when you pin a few locations at once before you do it, makes following along so much easier!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,i swear the creativity in this game is second to none. bad ass walk through
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-05,"i just started playing elden ring a week ago. haven't completed it yet but really enjoy the work and time you've put into this guide. really helped so much gain more understanding of elden ring, thank you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-08,late to the party you saved my investment in this game. i bought it as my first from soft game and knew it was going to be difficult. just knowing what to do and a further explanation of some of the mechanics has helped me tremendously. im super excited for the dlc now as well. thank again! great content
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"this is my first time playing a brand new game i grew up poor, but i'm finally making money! and was confused when i couldn't find part 3 you just released this one! i'll take me some time to readjust to walkthroughs that weren't released 5 years ago.  also, i love it that you end videos by telling us what we'll do next it's sort of like homework!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"game is absolutely insane, i'm 20h into the game, killed my first two major bosses and i still need to skip some sections of your video in order to not spoil myself"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-31,"for anyone myself in the future wondering the ball farm is located at lennes rise, top right of the map. cowboy details it 945"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-15,"just found this series after a few years off from the game. my original playthrough was when the game was new and everything was new, i spent near 200 hours just being lost. i'm returning to the game now as i know a lot of people are with the dlc on the horizon. and you are a great guide, voice is easy to understand, simple instructions and definitions, clear and concise information. thank you. i will be watching this whole series sort of in the background while i'm at work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-23,thanks
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,just wanted to say i thoroughly enjoy your walkthroughs. this is my first time playing a game like this and i know i could go into it blind but i enjoy being powerful and having someone mentor me along the way. im doing this now for a 2nd time with a melee character after going through as a op ass caster.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"man, getting this stuff took me north of 10 hours, if i start a second character, i'm gonne do exactly this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-04,right when you said dont poke the bear. is right when i ran into the bear.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-26,thanks! enjoying this immensely with your help!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-05-11,cowboys walkthroughs make all others look like absolute garbage. thank you so much for all the time and effort you put into these videos! they made getting platinum so much fun!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-22,"gotta say first time i started playing, i almost immediately turned it off and quit playing. the size of the game was overwhelming, but the amount of guidance is underwhelming instead. it was very frustrating to just run around and get your butt kicked, but as i invested more and more time i started to get an idea of how and what to play. together with these walkthroughs youve made that mission possible, and ive gotten more comfortable in my gameplay. thanks a lot!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-13,just a small thing that was missed at the end of the episode don't forget to talk to blaidd outside the gaol to get yourself a free somber 2 and continue his questline. it also unlocks an item purchasable from the giant blacksmith later on.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"hey dude i have been following you for years man thank you so much for the walkthrough. i just have one suggestion  when you stop at a certain structure or grace, can you please show us on the map where it is? it will make it a lot easier for us to follow. thanks!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-06,your walkthroughs are amazing man .. articulate commentary and straight to the point
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-22,"i follow alot of people who post walkthroughs. sir, without a doubt yours is the best. it's annoying when people make posts with them laughing and trying to be entertaining. i'm looking at the game for entertainment not them. you are very thorough and professional in your explanations. thank you for what you do."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-26,"man, i love you. you are the best kind of souls player. gamers who are awesome like the souls players and who share how to play this for newbies like me are great. i have a few souls players who keep all their secrets to themselves and are entitled. i love this."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,watched your entire ds1 walkthrough. good thing to do elden ring since theres so much. ill come back to watch these for ng to find all the things i missed. keep up the good work!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-18,5th annual fromsoft christmas break holiday with fightin' cowboy guiding my journey. he's like part of the family to me at this point. i will say i used to follow his every step during ds1 ds2 and bloodborne. i slowly started gaining more autonomy and now i'm at the point that i'm exploring on my own but when i need to get back on track so i don't waste 200 hrs wandering aimlessly or godforbid i fuck up some obtuse fromsoft situation that gets me a completely different ending or entrance into another region. thanks for 5 years of amazing holiday gaming fc!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-10,guys. i woke the bear
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-25,"wow just summarize all i said and thought thru this video. i have played 37 h so far and yet still amazed by what you found in one single video, cant wait to see the rest of them!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,almost 3 years later and this video is still guiding the tarnished
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,"been playing for around 30hours its amazing. i always love cowboy walkthrough so ill watch it all. that being said i feel that if you would want to guide a new player, you should watch the map more often, its easy to get lost"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-21,i greatly appreciate this video man. i got the game back in february when it came out and i had zero clue what to do or where to go and gave up playing after beating margit i thank you for your service to the game world
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,playing with cowboy is always the best been watching his videos for a while
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-11,you have made this game fun for me. i am not good with souls type games. i only beat the first because my buddy played with me and showed me where to go and beat the bosses for me. however this one was slightly easier for me in its open world nature. you my friend have made it so much better with your help and tips. thank you for this journey that i've been on since the early dishonored days
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-23,"wow. wow. wow. i'm new to dark souls games and more combat oriented games in general so when my friend bet me i couldn't beat malenia some time this year, i was honestly feeling super overwhelmed with everything going on. your walkthroughs made everything so much easier to understand and i can actually focus more on playing instead of feeling like i'm walking blind off a cliff."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-10,"love the walk throughs, thanks! not sure how hard it would be to do but a map with the route you take, marked with the locations, would be very helpful. easy enough to screenshot and refer to while playing and also helps to keep you from missing anything."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"i bought elden ring yesterday and watched your part one after i played for about an hour and a half and got off, i get on and i see your other video, its like you're progressing with me lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,kept refreshing and it's finally here! much appreciated. game too daunting to tackle on my own!much better to follow the cowboy
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-18,love your help! you also helped me get through stick of truth. and your voice isn't annoying and you don't talk during cut scenes. thank you.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-02,all of the comments!!! these walkthroughs have really helped me learn this game and make it so much more enjoyable! thank you!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,make sure to talk to the npc outside the evergaol after beating the bloodhound. he will give you a somber smithing stone 2 and more dialogue for another npc later.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-04,also if you do the ball farm at night there's a rare chance that a ball with small flames will appear giving 9k runes
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-12,i have played bloodborne sekiro dark souls 1 and 3. this is the only game i used a guide for bc of how large it is. thank you man!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-09,thanks. great walkthrough and much appreciatedeven 2 years and 4 million views later. congrats on your success!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-23,"so cowboy. you got me through ds3, nioh 1 and 2, sekiro and now i have finally decided to tackle elden ring.  thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,first time giving a souls type game a go. this walkthrough has been super informative so far much appreciated!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-05,about 1011 minutes in it seems like youre reading notes of some kind. are these shared any where?? i would love a manual to accompany your lovely videos
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-11,"hi great video. in min 2824 you say we will have to get a feel for what is a safe drop, actually its not true, if you stand on a ledge and go into inventory you can use a rainbow stone and drop it down, if it breaks the fall will kill you, if its ok and lighting up the floor down below, you will survive the drop"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-21,"i put over 500 hours in elden within the first year not proud, but came to your walkthrough because i know after all of that time played, i know theres still things i missed  plus your ds walkthroughs are great"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-21,"dude, these videos are so sick. i just beat the game on a bleed dex build but did everything blind  didn't research anything so i missed a bunch of stuff. i wanted to start a new character to get everything done, and these videos are perfect for that. you've really put a lot of effort into this and it shows. i'm really looking forward to following along this whole walkthrough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-02,"i, in fact, was hit by the ballista as you said, i've never been hit by it lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-10,i just got the game and your playthrough is so helpful
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"you were my primary reference for getting through this game. very thought out videos, great directions. well done sir"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-22,"i just finished your first episode and now starting this one. i just wanted to say thank you so much for this. this is my first game like this, and personally havent found a useful guide, but yours was right off the rip."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-03-05,"for the farming section around 815, you don't really have to turn around and look at the sphere all you really have to do is make sure it goes off the cliff and 'dies.' just a heads up."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-18,this game is literally impossible to play without a walkthrough
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,when you approach the fort where the giant is shooting huge arrows at you if you go up on the right hand side around the top of the rocks there is a golden seed.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-04,"you saved me from returning a game that was was too hard too understand for me in the beginning. as a failed dark souls tryerouter you showed me the actual set in the game. youre easy enough for me to play along with with just a little rewinding if i was confused. you helped me get out of the first graveyard i kept ending up in because of the man on the horse right out the gate in ep.1  here in ep.2 im still following and loving the game every step of the way finally. i was worried i wasnt going to like it and i would just return it, well i passed my 2 hours mark now for steam and i cant so i decided to buckle down and take the time to learn to play and youre helping me so much. thank you! teamsteamdeck"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-09-28,this is honestly the best walkthrough ive ever seen for a souls game played blood borne and souls 2 but elden ring is a whole other class of games lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-24,confession i sat here and farmed a ton of souls.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"killer walkthroughs, especially for new players. thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,the fact that i got the bloodhound sword so early and have been using it ever since 20 hours in makes me feel good about using it still  it's bleed effect is super good and it has really good reach.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-30,"probably 9 months too late but i found out three months ago that you can sell runes to the merchants. its a lot quicker than popping them. lol. these guides are still as excellent as when you first did them. i have 1000 hours on this game now. am max level and high levels on three other characters, have all weapons, armour, items , max runes etc and i still refer to these walkthroughs now and again when i forget stuff."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-18,this is my first time playing this game and with this walkthrough better than i thought
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-19,bro that ball is the only thing thats killed me on this play through so far
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"there's a boss at the boulder farm checkpoint that only comes out at night by the bridge. if you jump on the horse you can get him to follow you back through the poison gas trip hazards up the hill and he will eventually die and drop like 75,000 runes. not bad for not even swinging a sword."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-10,the wolf guy you snap your fingers at after sneaking by the bear was already down from there and just kills me. im having a tough time on that boss wothout him.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,"hey man i just wanted to say that your awesome, and you knowing what exactly to do helps out a lot. i usually just explore and fight the enemies and upgrade my character and just roll with it. but ever since i started my first gameplay on dark souls i ended up loving those games even knowing it can be a pain for certain players like myself. and when i saw elden ring i wanted it bad and didn't get it up until a few days ago, so i have been watching your walkthrough videos and its helpful. thank you again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,thank you for making the walkthrough very easy to understand and now ive been enjoying the game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-03-03,"thank you so much for these videos, as an old grey beard who sucks at this game first souls game its awesome to be able to get a better start!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"is nobody gonna talk about how it seems like morgot is returning to elden ring? we can hear his voice in the trailer utter little pillager, bent on sacking the lands of gold...i will swat away...any and all who dare approach. those words are almost exactly like what he says when he plays as margit and then when we face him again in the first game!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,nameless king? firekeeper? what're you doing here?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"tarnished finally, now that miquella is defeated, the lands between are saved! firekeeper, nameless king, centipede demon, and presumably the first flame bonjour"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,211 that was the fucking nameless king
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,the way i just stood up speechless in front of my tv.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,"the nameless king and firekeeper are wild reveals, but nobody is talking about how the eagle gliding is a direct reference to that bastard, the pursuer???"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"when godfrey defeated the storm king, you say? they meant that storm king?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,"the most impressive part of this trailer is the guy climbing the wall. i instantly went thorough the game world in my head think of locations where this is useful. an man, there are a lot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,1. bloodborne trick weaponsmaybe 2. firekeeper 3. nameless king 4. sekiro parry 5. multiplayer??!?!?!?!? what the hell is miyazaki cooking
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"important context from the famitsu interview the director is not miyazaki, but instead ishizaki, the level designer for ds and combat designer for ds3, bb, and er. it uses elden ring as a base because the developmental focus is on the gameplay. this isn't something with elden ring just slapped on though, elden ring was the explicit base. miyazaki also has previously stated that he wants new people to direct games, and asked directly for ishizaki to direct and approved of this game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"121 centipede demon from dark souls 1 211 nameless king from dark souls 3 i have no clue what this is, but i love it."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,everyone sees the nameless king but what about the centipede demon at the start? its the centipede from dark souls one that drops the orange charred ring to walk in the lava
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"just to put everyones mind at ease, it apparently isnt a live service game. the games director not miyazaki is quoted as saying, also, we want to be clear that nightreign is not like a live service game. once you you buy nightreign you get the complete package, everything is unlockable out of the gate. so we want it to be clear that this is what we wanted to make. it's not intended as a live service game. it is also playable solo, but cant be played with only 2 players. its either solo or a 3 person team."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,huge respect and thanks to the developers and everyone who worked on it! there was no game that i enjoyed as much as elden ring. we hope that there will be similar delicacies in the near future. which is certain and i will be on sick leave from may 30.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,this was so out of left field. none of us were expecting this. i haven't been speechless in a long time. i'm frickin speechless.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,anyone else noticing how riding on the hawkeagle is a lot like how you can get to lost bastille in ds2 and how the pursuer in forest of fallen giants also ds2 comes in to attack you both in the first encounter and his intro cutscene?

RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"finally, i can find out what the game i played for 100 hours is about"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-19,"there was actually another fragment of destined death stolen, which was then given to the lobsters in liurnia, to prepare them for the ineviteable age of the crabs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"i know it's a lot to take in, but this video will be the foundation for all the lore videos to come. so bookmark it, come back later, take your time, and try your best to remember the main characters names... godwyn and godrick and godfrey and godefroy and malenia and melina and miquella and marika and radahn and ranni and rykard and rennala..and radagon. see! easy!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-17,"the big twist in elden ring. when i played i did not realise there was a twist, in fact i basically didn't even understand who i was fighting or why i was fighting them 99 of the time!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-08,these crucible knights were also bestowed by the erdtree the ability to input read your healing
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"i checked his channel every day, its finally here!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"one interesting thing to note about the fight with godfrey in the arena where he's holding morgott's corpse, since he was stricken from his grace when he kiled his final great opponent and became tarnished, when we, years later, come back to that arena to find him there holding morgott, you can see morgott's body dissipating into golden dust just like our grace points us towards our goal, but godfrey's grace is pointing at us, his next great enemy, finally giving him purpose again. you can see this better if you fight him at night tho."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-23,feels very cool when you realize that the branches of the erdtree probably represent the law of causality with its branching effects and the trunk and roots represent the law of regression
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-28,"i want an updated lore video after the dlc comes out and reveals that the greater will serves the lobsters because of their sheer, overwhelming power."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"finally, now i can understand the lore behind soldier of godrick. after 100 hours of gameplay, my current theory is that he was a soldier who fought for godrick, but i may have missed some kind of twist."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"wow, i can't even imagine how many lore there are hidden in the world of the elden ring. incredible vaati !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-09,"damn, its awesome revisiting these videos in preparation for the upcoming dlc. ive been dying to do another playthrough but ive already completed er like 10 times so i want to wait until the dlc drops and do one full playthrough."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"wow... i felt like i understood the story and world of elden ring better than the other games, likely because i've come to look at these stories through your eyes. you still manage to blow my mind, however! thank you once again for your beautiful interpretation of the masterpiece that this game turned out to be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,and i suspect it was probably because of these lobsters. that was quality humor right there
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"regarding the marikaradagon connection, i think that radagon was marika from the start. you mentioned that marika had to go to war against many different forces that threatened the erd tree. godfrey was a skilled leader and warrior, but in order to wage war more effectively, she needed another champion that was an extension of her own will to lead her forces, so she created radagon. later on, when it came time to take over liurnia, marika found herself at an impasse due to rennalas forces matching hers in power. instead of continuing to fight rennala directly and risk losing more forces, she sent radagon with the intent of having him seduce rennala from the beginning. their marriage would put rennala directly under marika's thumb without rennala ever really knowing. but, there was a consequence to creating radagon. i don't think that marika was powerful enough to just will a sentient being into reality. i think that radagon is a part of marika that she separated from herself. specifically, he is the part of marika that had blind faith in the greater will. he is after all supposed to embody the golden order. that absence of faith is what caused her to begin doubting the greater will. radagon on the other hand instinctually desires to keep the order intact, which put him in direct conflict with this new faithless marika who wanted to test the limits of what she could get away with. when marika banished godfrey, radagon went back to her so there could still be an elden lord. when marika shattered the elden ring, radagon tried to fix it. marika wanted a tarnished to take the title of elden lord, but radagon doesn't, which is why when you find marika, radagon suddenly appears to stop you. this of course is just my interpretation though. there are likely some details that i'm missing that disproves it completely."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-11-30,"best nap ever, thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-22,"i found my first lobster when i was around level 20, and after about 30 minutes of trying and dying i decided he was tougher than margit whom i had killed 5 levels earlier. when i reached level 90 i returned to the site of that lobster and had my revenge. no longer would he haunt my dreams with his bs."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"now cometh the age of the lore, a thousand year voyage under the wisdom of vaati"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,"1750 so i am pretty sure that i can fill in marikas motivation here. the important item descriptions for this are the scarsealsoreseals these seals represent the lifelong duty of those chosen by the gods. solemn duty weighs upon the one beholden not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance. in the very beginning when marika became the chosen champion of the greater will and therefore became the god of the lands between she was completely onboard with the situation, after all she would be the god of this world and spread the golden order that she fully believed in. but as time went on she realized that this situation isnt nearly as perfect as she thought it would be. so she began to ask herself questions is the golden order really perfect? am i really a god or rather just a puppet of the greater will, being cursed to do its biddings for all time to come? it was these questions that made her try to find a way out of this situation, which will basically be the start of pretty much everything that we than experience in the game. she creates the tarnished by taking the grace away from godfrey and his people. sending them to fight in wars where they will die and later be reborn to become stronger. all with the goal that someday someone strong enough would appear to be able to fight a god. shattering the elden ring to create even more chaos and hardships, once again basically as training for this warrior who would hopefully one day appear. binding master hewg to the roundtable hold, so that once that strong warrior arrives, they would have a smith good enough to make them a weapon powerful enough to slay a god. creatingreviving melina and giving her the purpose of being able to burn down the thorns of the tree so that the chosen warrior would be able to get inside. so to come to a conclusion marika did all of these things so that someday someone would arrive who is able to kill her and the elden beast, so that she would finally be free from being the greater will's puppet for all eternity."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-05,"1502  hahahaha, i love that you're including more humor bits throughout the lore videos. i don't remember if you did that back in the day in dark souls 1 videos, but this one was hilarious."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,tortoise being forever dog and being simply excepted by the community is still my favorite piece of lore from elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-11-05,"842 when starting ranni's questline, she introduces herself as the one who stole death"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"its always fascinating to discover the difference between how you initially envisioned a games narrative before its release, to how it actually unfolds"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-05,"amazing video. your work never fails to amaze me. everything flows nicely, the sources at the bottom are a great touch, and the choice of visuals are always good. i'm not sure if the release of the mind map will be delayed due to the dlc releasing soon, but i'd love to be able to access it in the future for sure"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"fantastic timing, literally just beat it last night and i still have no idea what is happening with the story"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,"my theory is that marika and radagon are sort of an adam  eve character. where they were originally the same person, and then radagon was created from a piece of marika to go do his own separate work. and then eventually he was called back to her to become one again, just like the law of regression."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,i love that quick switch in tone at 1505! he'd been in completely serious lore telling mode and then broke it for a second with that!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-28,"656 vaati shows an enormous mind map of all the elden ring lore, is this viewable anywhere? i'd really like to see this whole mao"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,explaining the void creatures like astel is going to be interesting. can't wait for that!
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-09,1207 i really love that bit of lore. it's just fantastic to have him behave himself through trapping his fighting spirit inside of a giant beast on his shoulder
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,i'm still a firm believer that everything that happened was a plan to be able to kill that one bear in dragonbarrow cave
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-08,obsessed with this videos! you have an incredible voice for this type of content a great pace for it too. 1010 work
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-28,"i think the fact that marika and radagons children were cursed with rot and eternal childhood shows that marika and radagon were most likely one, hence producing faulty children"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-01,"being a souls fan from the beginning, i've watched a great many of your videos. it's been a while though, and after having stumbled across this one i was reminded that yours are the greatest of usergenerated content for this, my most favored series of games. i find that your videos are a complete package of quality video editing, thoroughly researched content and a soothing narration with a perfect tone, tenor and cadence for the subject mater. please accept this humble contribution, for i can imagine myself continuing to follow your content for the foreseeable future. i'll be sure to shop your displate wares as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-02-07,"damn, somehow the thought of rennala sitting on a giant lobster leading her army seems just so perfect and hilarious"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,amazing putting all this together! great video!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-10,1500 that really caught me off guard. i love when vaati temporarily becomes a comedian. laughed way harder than i care to admit
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-13,"something i thought was interesting was the fact that the greater will seems to despise the tarnished for one reason or another, so the tarnished even being allowed a fleeting chance of becoming elden lord had to be a scheme of marika. the erdtree refused to bless the tarnished beforehand, you actively have to burn the erdtree to access the elden ring because it will not allow you in, and the elden beast itself, the elden ring incarnate, fights against you in order to prevent you from becoming elden lord. to that end, i think that the tarnished becoming elden lord is a separation from the greater will, as you wrest control of the governing power acting on behalf of the greater will against it's, well, will. this is further supported by the fact that in 3 of the 4 elden lord endings, you actively change the logic of the world previously established by greater will. considering marika already had doubts about the golden order, i'm positive stopping the influence of the greater will through the tarnished was her ultimate goal."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"i think radagon is an alterego implanted in marika by the greater will to control her. an unfaltering guard of the order, as opposed to doubtful and inconstant marika. that's why he's trying to stop you from facing the elden beast, when marika logically would not. it's probably also what she means by him no being her yet, saying that he hasn't overtaken her will at that time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-07,very well formatted video man this was great helped me understand so much and it wasnt overwhelming it was very simple if your already into the game
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-24,i really like how this game tells you that these bosses are capable of leveling cities and are technically gods. then you kill them on your first try while you die multiple times because of a crab. i really love this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"love all the dialogue thats used here, makes it seem like were watching a documentary about the lands between"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"i love that after watching this video, i realized that the opening cutscene of the game with the hammer shattering images, the person transitions between marika and radagon"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-17,"my interpretation was that marika, unable to defeat liurnia on the field, created radagon by removing part of herself in order to manipulate rennala into peace, and once it suited her, recalled radagon to create more offspring. because radagon was always a fragment of her, he was also punished for the crime of the shattering and was reintegrated with her"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"my theory for the greater will's inability to interact with us in the lands between comes not from an actual incapability, but the idea that it's fighting this same battle on infinite worlds just like the lands between. that's why when you fight the elden beast you see an infinite forest of erdtrees before you. it shows that you are not special in this cosmic game, and that you are just another pawn, a bit player. as varre would say. there are likely countless elden beasts, countless lands between, and countless envoys of the greater will, who's values of order are primordial and absolute. edit to clarify, i'm not proposing multiverse, i'm saying there could be an infinite amount of worlds in this universe that are being imperialized by the greater will. places completely different from the lands between."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,you know this is the first time it occurred to me that radagon was specifically intended to seduce rennala and ultimately break her heart as a twisted strategy to defeat liurnia through an alternative means. if that's actually the case...damn that's cold.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,"to back up the fact of radagon and marika as one being, i just read the remembrance of the rot goddess miquella and malenia are both the children of a single god. as such, they are both empyreans, but suffered afflictions from birth. one was afflicted with eternal childhood, and the other harbored rot within. so they're both the offspring of a single god, either by some sort of parthenogenesis or selfcest, both of which would be highly likely to produce some form of birth defects, as we see is the case here."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,the dungeons at the end of catacombs was always so freaky to me. dozens of bodies all merging into the strange bed of chaos looking gnarled mess of roots in the back. i knew something had to be involved there.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-10-15,"i personally think that marika fragmented her soul, similar to how you can fragment the elden ring into runes, and the fragment of her soul was radagon, the aspect of herself who was loyal to the greater will. my reasoning being that at some point marika began acting in opposition to the greater will, this point is around the same time that radagon began to appear. then when marika stepped too far over the line, radagon was called back from liuria and was made to marry marika in an effort to contain her, and in an act of rebelion marika shattered the elden ring to keep radagon busy in order to buy horah loux and the tarnished more time to finish the plan."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"fun fact! the numen in elden ring are a pretty overt reference to the men of numenor from tolkien's lore. they, too, were powerful, longlived men who came from somewhere other than middle earth which is kind of another way of saying land between isn't it?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-06,this is fantastic. i enjoyed the game play but really scratched my head at the ending! thanks for this
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,a lot of people seem to miss ranni sitting on a dead two fingers when they talk about her i'm glad you caught it. in fact it looks as though it was mangled not just killed which suggest there was hatred in its killing.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-14,"war, pandemics the only thing constant in this world is vaatividya delivering 1010 content."

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-16,"great video, great voice, well done. the lobsters part is funny."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-05-24,"for me, melina is the biggest mystery. i really hope the dlc gives more info on her and the gloam eyed queen."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,finally we can find out what the hell is going on. incredible as always vaati.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-05,radagon and rennala's children  ranni  has powerful lunar magic like her mother  radahn  mastered gravitational magic like his father  rykard  ......feeded himself to serpent
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,this was incredible!!! so impressed but also adored this!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,as another lord once said i've been looking forward to this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-18,"i believe one of the most critical characters, that break open some of the stories most vital secrets, is the goldmask. even though corhyn eventually calls goldmask a blasphemer due to corhyn's loyalty to the teachings of the golden order, goldmask was on a quest to discover the true nature of order and discovered that the order, inherently, was full of deceptions and secrets. secrets that make the golden order seem more chaotic and deceitful"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-06-30,that bit with the lobsters was perfect and hilarious. also patches is the ultimate god of this world. no question about it lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-08-26,"this video was amazing! thank you for explaining the lore! also, the bit with the lobsters was hilariously unexpected."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-12-30,marika telling godfrey grow strong in the face of death has a whole new meaning when you think about maliketh being in control of destined death
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"i like how the elden beast is also represented in the beginning as a star , and he also has galaxy like attacks, kinda like other massive beasts like astel who also seemingly come from the stars."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-01-19,"i really want elden ring lore to become a book. just a big ass book that covers all the information and stories from start, when the elden beast arrival, to end when your gameplay starts."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,best story summary i've found so far. you guys did a really good job!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"finally, sir vaatithe all knowing has come to shed light on the lore!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,thank you for all the hard work. i'm enjoying soaking up all the elden lore into my spongey brain. i hope we get even more with future dlc!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"2539 right after she says radagon has yet to become her, she calls him 'my other self.' it is not at all uncommon in myth for deity figures to appear in different guises, or other aspects, of themselves. when she says he has yet to become her, i think what she is saying is that he, as an aspect of her, has not graduated from that position into the totality of her being. that is actually an extremely common motif in myth, lesser aspects of deities that are the deity, but, cast off, separated, or otherwise disconnected and haven't yet returned to what spawned them. i think we should also be careful about saying how openended they are about this, because if we look at all the evidence, we have to ask, which hypothesis better explains what we're seeing? radagon can't have previously been a separate being from marika if all the demigods are her direct offspring. furthermore, law of regression destroys illusion , as well as artificially wrought changes. judging from what the law of regression says, changing radagon back into marika is just that, a return . if you look at radagon and marika both, it is clear that they are literally broken, fractured beings. they're literally missing chunks of themselves. radagon is both a piece and embodiment of marika, though she had to leave a portion of herself behind. radagon's origin is in marika, and the way law of regression interacts with the statue, as well as what is said about the statue's origins, is the closest we're ever going to get to proof of anything in a from software game. radagon would only 'become marika' once they had reunited, once the law of regression, as a cosmic law not a spell, had worked itself out in radagon and marika."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-05,u r doing absolutely amazing work. thanks man
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-16,"i think we know the real reason why the shattering happened lobsters, dogs and crows."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-11,"if we get a dlc, i really hope its almost like a 'old hunters type dlc where we might get to see the the more powerful outer gods or even fight the greater will"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,i can't believe this video was 30 minutes long. it flew by in 5 minutes  this was incredible. thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-25,"i liked this series i stumbled on. the more i listen, the more i get pulled in. his voice, stories, and even the sponsors are interesting. really love it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"i'm definitely in the marika and radagon were always the same person camp. i think it's the only way all the demigods were descended from marika makes sense. it could be a situation like d where originally they had two bodies and two minds, but one soul?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"you can really see the influence george had with helping the story along. he has a lot of experience with simplifying crazy family dramatics and old timesfantasy lore. great video, too btw. also noticed malikeths blades hand guards broken and snapped off, a part of the death rune that ranni stole. lots of really cool visual details there to take from. starting new game 5 today!."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"i always thought that marika's motive was less about understanding the golden order that she created and more about seizing full control of it and escaping the greater wills influence. i know that grrm's influence has been a bit of a meme in some parts of reddit, but i do think that marika is elden ring's cersei. she's behind the whole thing and has contingency after contingency to help bring about her freedom and true reign over the lands between. unfortunately for her, that changed when the greater wills figured out what she was up to and forced radagon, who was a loyal follower of the golden order and, by extension the greater wills, to become the new elden lord to keep marika in check. i think that she was able to continue scheming in spite of this however, but had to resort to using and aiding others in their scheming, such as helping ranni to steal part of the rune of death. i think marika did this because she knew that ranni also opposed the greater wills, so their interests were aligned. she didn't realise that, however, that in order for ranni to see her goals to fruition, it would require the death of another demigod, namely godwyn, marika's firstborn. this was the point that threw her over the edge and, in her grief she did something mad and drastic. i believe that her shattering the elden ring was akin to hitting a fire alarm or a panic button. she knew it would cause a great deal of chaos, which would be the perfect environment for her secret army of tarnished to thrive in and help get rid of radagon and the greater wills. however the greater wills, i believe, also had a trick up it's sleeve and intended on making use of the tarnished. by using the erdtree to seal of marika's throne room, it encouraged the tarnished to gather the shards of the elden ring together, but stops you from entering. that way, once the tarnished is gone, the elden ring can be repaired and everything can go back to the way it was before the shattering, which the greater wills would love. meanwhile, from her prison, marika uses her power over grace and the guidance of grace to usher you towards the ultimate goal of breaking through that seal which is why the golden light continues to guide you towards the giants flame, even though that would be committing a cardinal sin, which is something the greater wills would never allow anyway, all of this is nothing more than speculation and educated guesswork on my part, so take it with a heavy handful of salt. tldr marika is playing 5d chess against the greater wills"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-07,"im very grateful for nonauto generated subtitles. thanks, mate"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,the lore king has returned ! eagerly been waiting on this vaati
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"the use of become in saying that radagon is yet to become marika, may be in the sense of something being unbecoming. marika may be saying that radagon is yet to be fit to be a part of her once more, having been a separate distinct entity from her which has diverged too far from marika, despite originating from her."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"cant wait for him to cover the outer gods more, really curious about his take on the frenzied flame"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-13,"unbelievably good summary, thank you so much!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"i don't think it's a coincidence that when radagon met and fell in love with rennala, head of an academy of astrologians, someone who almost certainly knows about the malformed stars being sent to destroy entire civilizations by the greater will, suddenly marika realised maybe the golden star that conquered the lands isn't actually a benevolent host but a malevolent parasite."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,so glad vaati took his time with releasing this its rare to have this much anticipation for a youtube video
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-04-20,"just started elden ring two weeks ago. totally obsessed. what a beautiful game. the world building, the nightmare fuel characters, the gameplay being unforgiving. so much fun. i try not to spoil too much because its so much fun to round a corner and say wtf. your channel is amazing. very smoothing voice and so well curated."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-14,just finished my first play through and i your videos are so well thought out and put together love these lore videos makes me feel even more connected to the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-14,"love how vaati started incorporating more jokes into his videos. those were legit hilarious, especially the one with the dog at 906"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,thourt yet to become me makes sense for radagon always being marika because radagon didn't know he was marika until after he came back to her. he's like a self aware part of her but ultimately is powerless because she's the whole and he's a part.
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"the time has finally come for everyone to understand what the hell happened in elden ring, thanks vaati!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-14,1550 that cut is so misleading at first. i thought turtle pope was lead an army xd
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-30,"i'm not sure if anyone mentioned this, but it's really interesting how most of the debuff in the game is associated with outer gods. scarlet rot  god of scarlet rot madness  frenzied flame bleed  formless mother frost  the moon deathblighted  greater will the only two debuffs not directly associated with any debuff is poison and sleep, though with dlc, who knows."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-09,"been waiting for you to drop some lore videos, such a beautiful video, you did an incredible job! excited to see you dive deeper into each side of the war, feels like fromsoftware tried their best with this story"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-17,"what a beautiful video. just finished it and am 5 minutes into watching it a second time, incredible content!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-22,rewatching this to be ready for shadow of the erdtree!
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"thank you, vaati"
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-18,mom can we have rennala we have rennala at home rennala at home 1608
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"one of my interpretations from reading one of the lore timelines that have been put on reddit, it mentions the fire giant god cursing marika during her slaughter of them, and radagon hates his red hair being a lot like the giants, its got me thinking maybe the giants curse split marika into 2 people i mean the timeline stuff was vague so i dont know if radagon was about before that or not but the giants themselves possess 2 faces and so it feels potentially very thematic"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-12-10,"interesting how both the law of causality and the law of regression can both be represented as rings, as well. causality is essentially the ripple effect and regression is everything eventually comes full circle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2022-04-08,"2541 the theory that ive heard that makes the most sense to me is that radagon was made from marika using a piece of the elden ring, specifically the criss crossing diagonal lines behind it on the cover and at his statue she made him so she could fight a war on two fronts with radagon handling the carian family, but when radagon fell for rannalla and had kids that also became demigods, marika now without a consort realized that she could use radagon instead thus birthing miquella and melania. so when she shattered the elden ring radagon attempted to repair it by merging with marika to hold themselves together and precent the complete collapse of order"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-19,this video is for all the people that come into my twitch chat asking for tips and how to start the game. also i didn't mention it in the video but there is a way to farm greyoll the big dragon. if you run back to the grace soon as she dies then you'll get the runes and she respawns.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-10,"3138 try not to die you saved my playthrough with this very sage wisdom, thank you youwy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-20,literally 100 percent this game... but i have the strongest need to watch every elden ring video i come across.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-22,who else is just starting this game for the first time now?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-02,"absolutely insane video, no other video goes so in depth for the first hour. went from not knowing a single thing to being able to comfortably play and understand what everything does. amazing video man."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-03,"love this walkthrough it makes you a beast right away without any spoilers. that being said, it would be soo helpful if you quickly flashed your maps when moving place to place, showing where you are and where you are headed. it would definitely make this an s tier starter video."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-18,i just started this game literally 2 days ago. its my first souls from software game so this is incredibly helpful. i didnt know i could just skip bosses so i ended up wasting like 2 hours on that first horse dude.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-17,"i gave up on this game a few years ago after so...many...damn...deaths. but tonight it clicked, i wasn't prepared. this guide prepared me, and i thank you. after countless deaths i finally took down my arch nemesis, the tree sentinel and the night's cavalry! i no longer fear the horsemen! i now seek them out..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-11,"very helpful, i just upgraded my pc and on a quest to download all games i've missed in the past 5 years! this was one of them!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-26,"great video, thanks for the start! one note was that this video was realllly hard to follow without pausing and rewinding frequently. and if you get a little lost you have to scan the video for landmarks to find out where the heck you are. some map screenshots would have been incredibly useful."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-18,this is exactly the video i needed the first time i ever played this game... it's the first souls game i've ever played and about half of my first 50 hours with this game was spent learning how the game works lol this video would've helped me so much
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-20,"siofra river has a somber 5 stone and the ghost glovewort 1 through 5 for your summon. for an early op summon banished knight engvall is very easy to get in the catacombs all tge way up tge river that patches cave is on, where yura helps you with the bloody finger invasion. 16 mind is what it takes to summon him tho, so keep that in mind lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-22,pov you bought the game when it came out but still havent played it since its so overwhelming
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-14,"even though this video is only 90 mins long, this literally took me a whole day and a bottle of wine!. can't wait for the dlc ......."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,just started playing this game yesterday for the first time!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-03,just starting the game and this is by far the most in depth guide i seen so far. thanks!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"ur guide is good, but u are too fast so its really difficult to catch up"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,i started the game yesterday and this is by far the best beginner's guide i came across.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-28,"i missed out on a lot of quest lines first play through skipping into different areas, wanted to start a new character and this helped tremendously, didn't skip anything but got slightly strong enough to play through the beginning thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-05,i usually dont comment on youtube videos but i just started elden ring and had no idea what i was getting into for the most part. after finding this video though ive been saved!! everything is so clear and easy to follow thanks so much for making this it really helped me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-04,"dude, i'd be lost without this video. thanks for taking the time to put this together! my first attempt at streaming this was so difficult but now that i've prepped myself with your video i'm good to go!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-29,"love the video for the wealth of great information but following along while playing was extremely tough. it would have helped tremendously to just open up your map real quick whenever you got to the points of interest so those of us that don't know the landscapes could actually know where you were. other than that, fantastic content!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-11,"before watching this video i tried killing margit the fell omen straight away and i couldnt do it, went back there after doing this and done it second try, thanks buddy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-09,i am lv 322 on my 2nd run and watching and i want to watch every guide vid on youtube
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-19,news of dlc depot... and youwy posting a video for new players. the stars are aligned my friends... dlc news imminent!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,started today 3 years later. one of the hardest yet rewarding games ive played. lowkey better than dark souls and bloodborne.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-25,"ive been playing 20hrs before i realised, if you hold the circle down you can run faster. so many beginner videos dont explain the tiny obvious things"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,"it's really hard to love elden ring, it's very overwhelming for someone who just played a soul game. watching this video, i still don't know what to do. lmao"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-19,"i just started the game a few days ago, beat tree sentinel and then didn't feel like exploring the open world so i hope this video puts me back on track what a godsend"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-04,945 don't ignore crafting crafting is useful and it's how you get a bunch of throwables arrows and your bombs items. its actually really uselful.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-21,i've owned the game since release but am just tonight starting up. yours is the first video i've watched. thanks.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i'm sitting at about 800 hours and around 60 playthroughs on new files, but that won't stop me from watching a beginner's guide to elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-13,"that was fun to watch. i decided not to overlevel myself for my first character, but the locations and tips you provide are very much appreciated."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,"this is my first souls game, and after struggling a whole day with zero progress, this video helped me get a good start in the game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-05,man i gave this game a try and its a beautiful game but i got discouraged didnt know how to start or where to go thanks for this i realize elden ring is one of those games if ur new to souls games ur going to need a basic tutorial cause it doesnt guide u well
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,4955 a quicker method to kill the dragon is by getting the flail and just holding the skill button r2rt. takes about 4 min. it's also possible to farm this boss by running to the light of grace and resting just when the death animation starts
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-04,to any new players the only thing that is really useful to make with crafting is the gold pickled fowl feet which gives you around 50 more runes from enemies you kill. the cookbook can be purchased from patches in murkwater cave. very helpful for leveling up quicker
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-26,when youwy released the skybox tier list video i thought he was in trouble. i thought this man has lost it. fromsoft give him the dlc before he starts making tier list about grass! now we are here and he is still making solid videos and it seems his sanity is still intact.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-26,"dude, thank you so much for making this. i hesitated on buying this game until now and i wouldve been completely lost without this video. you saved me a lot of time, confusion, and frustration."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,thanks so much! had to pause and rewind constantly lol. that rune farming hack with the indianna jones death ball was a lifesaver!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-10,"when i ran from the black horseman, i accidentally jumped off the cliff. when i did, i landed on an edge just before i hit the bottom. he followed and died right when i did. i was so mad until i woke up at the site of grace with the new ash of war. when i picked up my runes, there were 42,000 runs more than when i died"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-20,"nice work, youwy. a fresh beginner's guide makes sense with dlc looming, as that likely draws new players who decide to buy both originaldlc content at once. plus, if you wanted, you could easily expand the beginner series with shorter videos on more specific topics according to whatever categories make sense. could be beginners guide to twohandedsword build, dualweapon, build, incantation build, sorcery build, etc. it could be beginners guide to poise break build, status proc, intelligence spells, faith spells, etc. it could be beginner's guide to swords, axes, hammers, spells. lot of ways to go with it for new content."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,playing this game makes me sleepy which is cool after a long day of work.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,"excellent video, very informative. i have watched many videos about elden ring but yours is the first one i have found that takes all the questions and turns them into answers. thanks."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-20,"thank you so much for this wonderful work, as a total beginner to elden ring and any souls like game ever, game is somewhat more forgiving and making it a nicer experience to learn thanks to this guide."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-30,i was overwhelmed with all the maps and new terms but this guide helped a lot! thanks! the first boss one was epic
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-07,"great video, i am just getting into elden ring and its such a hard but addictive and fun game, i now have all the information i need"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-02,"this is fantastic, it came randomly and since i'm preparing for the dlc this route is amazingly explained."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,thnx so much for this video bro. it has helped more than u can imagine and you make it so clear aswell
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-27,i appreciate the idea of this video because i was thinking for a beginner walkthrough but didnt wanna watch one from the week of the games release..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-14,love this video but as a player that just played his first 50 hours i have to say im glad i did it all blind. this game is so much fun to explore!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,"just started, excited, overwhelmed etc  bought it on pv hopefully start off my pc journey on a life changing note. heard amazing things."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,"thank you for making this video, i followed through everything that you did. i was so lost when i started the game, and keep trying to kill the tree sentinel over and over again without knowing what else to do. and did got hit with the teleportation trap and fought some of the end game boss and died again. but so far i'm doing good now after watching this, good guide, keep up the good work."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,"bro just started never played a souls game before , thanks for the guide about to play now"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-27,don't go after the radagon soreseal talisman at 5113... the medallion was achievable but getting to the talisman was difficult and i ended up losing the 150k runes from it....
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,this is not a beginners guide this is a half assed speedrun. very interesting but 100 not how i will paly the game and i dont think any first time player should ever do this. might aswell not spend money on it if you are just gonna skip the entire early to mid game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,"amazing!! helped me a lot, thanks!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,"this game is overwhelming to start, but you made this easy to follow. just saying thanks!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-18,great vid! gave me an awesome head start and as someone who's new to the souls genre this is exactly what i needed. thanks!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-25,thank you so much for the intro to the game i was having a hard time getting started. now it's one of the best games i've played in my life so yeah it's a good game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-05-22,"i have been struggling in this game and even deleted it a couple times. thank you man, im really e going this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-09,"horseback combat depends on what kind of player you are. there are some mini bosses and bosses i only defeated by being on a horse. that's because i'm more of a hit and run or slash and dash kind of player. basically throw a few hits then run to either dodge the boss attack or recover some health. if i try it with face on combat, i get killed. try doing combat both ways and you'll find out what kind of fighting style works for you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-02-28,"plan on getting the game during the next steam sale. preciate the vid update got the game a while ago, now have around 150hrs. fantastic game would recommend to all"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,"this is the best walkthrough ive seen, great work man!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-20,if you talk to blaidd in the ruins where you got the axe talisman he will help you fight the bloodhound knight for the bloodhounds fang curved greatsword and he will give you a somber 2 stone.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"i tried this game 2 years ago and stopped immediately. tried again and got frustrated and didnt know what to do and stopped. finally thanks to videos like this, i am officially playing and slowly getting it, and exploring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-15,nice video mate. you actually leave info on the screen long enough to see it. and you explain everything . what level is your character on after 2000 hours?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-07,i just picked up after about 2 years. this was refreshing to watch
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"big help! i had such a hard time getting into this game, but now i feel like i go the distance!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,i love the way he never tells where he is going
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-14,"makes for a great start and opens map, vendors and save points! thanks so much!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-18,here i am rune farming in limegrave because i was too afraid to venture out. love how unique this game is.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,god tier video my man struggling to kill anything in this game but after this video im confident thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-11,"good video! helped me out a lot coming back after a good 2 year break. i'll admit.. it was challenging following you through a few areas that i didn't remember, but once i paused and figured out those spots i was good to go. one little thing about golden runes that wasn't mentioned that i'm sure new players will appreciate is that you don't lose them when you die... i always save my runes and use them for something specific. whether it be leveling up or buying something, i try to be as close to zero runes as i can, only using golden runes to get to that mark."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-25,man everytime i wanna try elden ring i watch one of these videos and lose all motivation..who wants to all this before starting the actual game..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-06-26,this video was awesome! i got very frustrated with the game and never have played a souls type game and your explanations helped me a ton
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-03-09,"4037 i got jipped. i lead him around the bridge corner but he went on the ledge with me. i jumped around trying to escape i fell off and died, he fell off and died. i got the the gold ash of war but never got the runes. i ran back to pick them up. thinking there was 55k there, i swallowed a golden foot. nothing. nada. i had 0 runes to begin with before i fell off. my rune pick up marker had 0. edit i was farming the metal ball drop, got up to 82k then randomly it gave me 9,720 runes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-16,wow i love this guide! you explain a lot that other's don't. you gave me courage!! i downloaded elden ring yesterday and i'm gonna try it now  hoping this will get me prepared to play darksouls as the ultimate end goal hahahaha
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,the night calvary is also done on the other end but opposite side of the bridge. have him follow you once hes about to catch up jump back on the bridge.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,thnq so much for this walkthru .. rlly needed as i just begun yesterday and was clueless where and what to do...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,"lol i was following this for the second time. the first time i did it fine. this time, while trying to home boy to fall off the bridge, i got one shot then he fell off. when i respawned i got the ash of war but had 0 runes of course. which means now i have to run it back and start from 0 again lol. cruical"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,10515 when he said were at the hour15 mark and should not have taken this long i was following his words and video verbatim and took me nearly 5 hours .
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-15,"for the troll carts, you can also follow them until they reach their destination if you happen to be struggling with killing one of them, though this might take a while lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,"i have over 147,000 hours in this game, and i'm here to correct you and help players get a better understanding. this guide is clearly made by a noob and needs serious revision. i'm kidding. i'm literally just starting this game and it's my first souls game. i've beaten hollow knight twice with about 106 completion in both playthroughs. however, this game is a whole new level. i've tried playing it about a year ago. however, the endless readingstatsitems and difficulty felt a little overwhelming, and i admit that i got pissed off and gave up. so i appreciate this guide and the time you have put into it. hoping it helps me out. i'm really hoping i can get into the game without wimping out and quitting again. hoping you can help."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,thanks man. gave me a great starting point for the game!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,started 2 days ago i can definitely say this guide has helped me with collecting a good amount of ruin currency i had issues with the holder and the knight calvary tho the bolder disappeared and so did the knight when he fell off but either way 1010 i can say i can not die as much as i did before  i been sleep deprived for the last 2 days first day pulled a all nighter trying to fight the first boss on my own without nothing besides starter set up 11058 i stopped around here due to going to get mcd for the gf since she got me this game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-05,i know its five months later but i gave up 2years ago and never beat the game. im committing this time and found this extremely helpful and entertaining. thanks for taking your time to make this. glad to see youre still playing. 3
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,"this was incredibly helpful, thank you so much."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-19,"best tip for all souls games, don't be scared to look up walkthroughs, don't be scared to ask where to go. fromsoft does a good job of making the first playthrough less fun than consecutive playthroughs when it comes to knowledge about the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-01,i feel like you just saved me 2500 hours of playtime. thanks for the incredible walkthrough!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,"my first ever youtube comment, and i just had to say this was so helpful"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-05,ty for the video ive never actually played dark souls games like ever now i started with dark souls 1 little and then i started elden ring and wow i learned alot from this ty for the video mate3
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-10,this video is amazing. it helped me so much!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,this was very helpfull felt like we was playing together following your every direction
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,thank you so much for this!!! i just started a few days ago and had been having a very rough time. i think i specd my character wrong and i cant use any weapons i find with no runes to boot. this helped a lot!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-01-19,"vagabond for minmax faith builds that demand 12 or more dex for weapons, prophet for pure faith and strength faith. i nervous sweat with anything higher than 10 dex."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,"11311 this boss is not too hard... just keep spamming your weapon skills. cool. this is my first souls game, but i have 44 years of gaming experience so this shouldn't be a proble.... dead ohhhkay, maybe i didn't start spamming my weapon skills early enou... dead alright, maybe i should... dead way too many tries later got it.  youwy you and i are definitely not the same.  seriously, though, this video was utterly amazing. i greatly appreciated how you both taught the basics but didn't slow your pace. so much content in so little time. utterly fantastic!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-06,about to start today. thanks for the guide
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"ive quit this game 3 times already since it came out. this is a great vid, thanks!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-28,really good video bro! set me up for success and makes the game so much more fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,it's harder to get golden parry from the scarab that drops it than it use to actually use it against malenia
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,parrying is essential for the crucible knights. i stopped being afraid of them when i learned that they can absolutely be destroyed by parrying.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,my favorite thing about playing this way is when i shout get that shit outta here as soon as parry someone after failing 10 times in a row
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,the katana parry from dark souls 3 was my all time favorite. when you sheath the blade and suddenly swing it upward? the best
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,"fun fact... that curved sword parry animation is the colloquially called the obi ani sword spin, a la the iconic duel on mustafar in star wars ep. iii. its been used for several weapons throughout in souls games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,"finally, someone who talks about parry on curved swords!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-28,i just want to say that i love your use of the oblivion ost.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,"i think carian retaliation is just as fast as buckler parry, and it lasts 2 frames longer, and it has a larger hit box, and costs no fp if it only parries a melee hit and not a spell. it's just buckler parry but better"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,golden parry was nerfed. carian retaliation hsa the most active frames by 1 more frame than the buckler. golden parry has 2 less active frames than the buckler
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,have you seen those warriors from hammerfell? they have curved swords! curved. swords. maybe they were onto something.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"greenwolf really just said as far as partying goes, this is the worst option. but it looks cool and im good enough at the game that it doesnt matter."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"idk why but ive always used the iron roundshield whenever its available , i know the buckler is better, the roundshield is just more comfortable for some reason personally"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,you know a game is good when even the objectively worst option is someone's favorite. love it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"rest in peace golden parry, you will never be forgotten."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-25,"honestly, my favourite parry is thops barrier it works like a regular parry, and it works as a deflection for spells and such, so it works for me, and im talking about the fusable ash of war, its a parry but with spells as well. along with the fact that its for thops."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,underrated content creator
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"you forgot to mention that carian retaliation actually has 1 more parry frame than the buckler parry with the exact same startup and endlag, making carian retaliation actually the best pure melee parry, and the best in slot parry period due to the ability to delete magic projectiles. golden parry used to have the same amount of active parry frames too before it got nerfed from 6 to 3, but its mp cost meant that carian retaliation was still better even if golden parry had more parry range. but now post nerf golden parry is much worse."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,"parrying always was just too fucking hard to bother with in fs games that i just never bothered with them. dont know if there was always an input delay or something, but it is the hardest game to do anything called parrying in."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,"i was never good at parrying, so instead i learned that not locking on is the best thing ever"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,the elder scrolls oblivion music in the background made me very happy.. thank you.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,i like with the parrying dagger.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"i like using a dagger offhand and slapping a parry on it. for style, i use the bloodstained one"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"i miss rocking an offhand scimitar in ds3, all the looks of surprise when i got the parry. side note the buckler has the most active parry frames out of all parries. i believe golden parry and storm wall tie for second highest with 11 active frames. the buckler, however, has a staggering 14 frames"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,"buckler has been my dedicated offhand slot on every build since ds3. the thing is light, has best parry frames, and the sickest flick animation. even on mage builds i have it in the second offhand slot just to switch to if the need be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,"i like running with two curved beastman blades, one with parry. the timing is rough, and im still working on it with a few bosses, but man doesnt it look badass"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,"2 things i liked, that weapon parry at the end, and the dress"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,i prefer to use the knife parry animation bcuz even if you miss time it it can reduce the damage incoming
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-16,"carian retaliation only consumes fp if it creates glintblades, so it is always better than the buckler parry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-18,i like the new main gauche for parries since the dlc released. it's super light and i think has the same frames as a small shield. the timing on it is just easier to me for some reason especially against the ageing untouchables.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,i love oblivion. subbed. thank you for using my favorite rpg soundtrack man!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,"hot take, but i ditch parry with my shield so i can use the ash of war of my sword without swapping off the shield."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,"throp's barrier is a 0fp version of carrian retalition, making spells simply miss for the durration of the parry rather than destroying them, while also being free and keeping the basic parry's frame data."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,laughs in sekiro
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-01,i personally use carian retaliation i found out that it also works on throwing pots for some reason
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,"weapon parrying is just as fast on the startup as parry shields, which was not the case prior to the dlc patch. its a decent option. it does however have fewer active frames than parry shields."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,daggers. its so cool to dual handle daggers with the main with parry. looks so cool
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,you know it's a good list when one of the options is put there because it looks cool.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-08,"it's also fun to put the parry aow on daggers too, my best advice when parrying is to aim for the hands of your opponent and not the blade of their weapon"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"i loved using the katana parry in ds3 for the same reasons as the curved sword parry. it's the hardest to pull off but it's stylish as hell, especially when catching somebody off guard with it in pvp"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,i only use regular parry on the parrying dagger because nothing is better than that elden bling
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,informational content and oblivion music ? amazing
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"carian retaliation carried me for a long time, and it'll keep doing it, i used it against margit when i tried to defeat him with parry, and i succeed."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-28,don't forget the dagger parry. good stats and it's perfect for those of you who like to have a quick offhand weapon to compensate for the speed of the main hand weapon. the same could be said for the few mad lads who like the double katana moveset as the wakizashi can activate that moveset as well as use the parry skill same for the main gauche and the double thrusting sword moveset.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-08,"idk why but i find it easier to small shield parry than buckler parry. if i'm not mistaken, small shield has faster recovery anyway. which means it's easier to follow up a successful parry when you inevitably whiff one."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"i use bandit curved swords cuz they're drippy as fuck, and i completely abandoned my shield when i realised i could just parry with the sword, they're a bit janky but ive reached the point of being pretty consistent with them outside of specific bosses. the hardest part of parrying is spending half an hour trying to parry something just to find out that it isnt parryable because the game doesnt tell you..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,i've just completed oblivion and moved onto another game... listened to this... i'll just go back and replay it..
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,remember buckler parry  small shield parry  medium shield parry
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,parrying really gives you a very different gaming experience. like for example people kept complaining how hard crucible knights were while i literally couldn't understand how they think they were in any way hard lol. tried to best them without parrying and they spanked me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-07,replayed ds1 not too long ago and realised i could still parry well in that so ive started doing it more in elden ring and its so much fun parrying some of the bosses
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"pretty sure curved swords parry window may be the shortest, but its also the fastest. really benefits you if you got decent reaction time."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,"this kinda reminded me of how i sucked while playing lies of p for the very first time, not to mention it's really hard but it was my first ever soulslike. let's just say it took me a while to grasp all of the stuff, but i still really enjoyed the experience! 3"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-06,im a stealth caster learning upfront melee and a souls vet. just discovered this yesterday.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,"magic is my jam. first play i did a mage, then after elden beast, once i had some levels to play with i went 2h into the dlc. now i am into ng with incantations and great sword. curb stomping everything in my path. i didn't even know parry was in the game until recently."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,carian retaliation has the same frame window as golden retaliation but doesn't cost fp unless you parry spells. pretty neat
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,it's amazing you can parry a gods attack
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-01,"dual wield parry curve swords is one of my favorite builds, so flashy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-05,"it's crazy how the parrying dagger has such a wildly different parry window that it becomes almost unusable, at least in my experience. if you can get it to work then fantastic, i'm jealous"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,on carian retaliation since i've seen comments elsewhere but its not mentioned here it only costs 8 fp to make the glintblades so you can use it freely for melee attacks even at 0 fp
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,"the best souls like parry in my opinion, is from lies of p with the two dragons katana it just feels insanely good, but is hard to master, it even rewards with a strong slash to the enemy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,im pretty sure the reason the curved swords have the lowest parry window is because in dark souls 2 there was a weapon called the painting guards curved sword that you could basically parry with at any point during an opponents attack before they hit you and it would parry it. it was nearly undefeatable.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-28,don't forget about storm wall that's available really early in limgrave if you haven't beaten stormveil castle to buy the buckler off gostoc or don't want to hike to caria manor for carian retaliation. i believe it has parry frames that are just a little less than carian retaliation but basically feels rhe same anyway.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"storm wall, as well. excellent frames, cheap fp cost, and flings away physical projectiles. it's a weird niche, but it works."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-30,my first mage play through intot he dlc forced me to start parrying against the death knight when magic wasn't working and later i was obsessed with with it. glintstone sorcery sword has 110 crit which was lovely too
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"i love doing the spell parry with the tree sentinel shield, a lot of players i invaded didnt know how to react at first haha"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,"small correction, carian retaliation only consumes fp when used agains spells and has the highest active frames together with golden parry. so i would argue that carian is better then buckler."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"i'll be honest, i zoned out to everything you were saying the moment i heard the guild wars background music and got slammed by nostalgia"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,"hema fun fact a buckler is not carried om the arm, but in the hand, facing your opponent. deflecting an attack with the buckler on the arm would be dangerous since the oppent's blade could slide into the exposed part of the arm. moreover, holding in the hand opens for a lot of movements with the wrist and it can also give you a lot of reach for a parry window."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,"i'd strongly recommend getting your hands of the assassin's cerulean dagger talisman if you plan the use either carian retaliation, or golden parry. equipping that talisman means you get your fp refunded whenever you get those critical blows in after parrying your enemies into a stance break."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,carthus curved sword lives rent free in my head
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-11,"man i really miss the katana party from ds3, otherwise medium shield parries are def my favorite to hit since i used the buckler for 2 years before making it harder for myself for fun! and yeah it made it way more satisfying to parry stuff"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,you can also dual weild curved swords and parry for extra style points.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-01,"just try practice with dagger or curve sword first and when u get used to with it, try carian retaliation and u will never miss a parry"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,partying against the caelid bell bearing hunter was so immensely satisfying after all my failed attempts at bonk combat
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,i can't parry shit every time i think i have the timing down i die
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,i wish the katana sheath stance still could parry with the heavy attack instead of the slash
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-22,that curved sword animation is so stylish that fromsoft kept it since ds1
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,i love the oblivion music
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-30,i personally use daggers for parrying since they have the most parry frames
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,one of my favorite parries is the windwall one that messes up most long range weapons.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,listened to this for 5 minutes while i hung up my laundry
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-04,"never played a souls game ever in my life , but im diving deep into this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,can please more info about parry  actually never tried but would love to know everything about it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-04,"here is the parry frame data for carian retaliation and buckler parry. carian retaliation 4 startup frames, 6 active frames, 13 recovery frames. buckler parry 4 startup frames, 5 active frames, 12 recovery frames. in most cases carian retaliation is still the best because it gets the highest amount of active frames though buckler parry can be useful in scenarios where you will need to parry back to backconsecutively but still i would much rather prefer carain retaliation since its only 1 frame longer recovery time than buckler parry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,curved sword parry is best because looks cool
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,this guy parrys every boss like its nothing yet i struggle with the wrinkling old bastards at the very start of the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,one of the things i want to learn how to do before i go into the forever box is to learn how to parry. i just don't understand it. but i really want to learn how to do it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-16,"love jumping in, throwing on the buckler and just playing with bosses"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,now the only question is why i can perry attacks from bosses like a champ but for the love of god i cant perry any attack from regular enemy i find in the open world ?? i killed oneill without him taking a hit from him but cant parry any soldier attacks
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-15,"and buckler has the most qctive frames, followed in terms of the good ones by carrian retaliationthe other and frankly more important reason its so good and small shields, and then golden in last with the same as a normal parry on a medium shield, but due to how parry's work in elden ring the range more than makes up for it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,"i prefer golden parry because most enemies are really big and take up a lot of space on the screen,i'm more comfortable being able to see the parry animation"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,i like putting it on misericorde. ive always liked the parrying dagger parry
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"came for the parries, stayed for the oblivion score."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,nothing beats the abyss wstchers sword parry in ds3. that shit is so cool
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,"besides blocking a hit and countering with a heavy swing in elden ring, ive never parried in any of the souls games i havent gotten to sekiro yet so i know i will eventually. in elden ring i just dodge until ive seen their whole move set and then punish openings with a two handed 15 standard brick hammer aka the best weapon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,oblivion music is so relaxing
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-29,then theres powerstanced dagger builds that just have a parry as a particular fuck you to anything that can be parried and they have the third best window behind small shields and buckler
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-01,ds3 katana parry fr feels like ascension once you nail it
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,"i've never been able to parry in elden ring, and i'm almost at 1,000 hours"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-29,the parrying dagger and main gauche also come with parry and its cool to do it with a dagger
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,me guard counters and blocks attacks when i can honestly that's how i play i'm bad at the timing and because i usually just summon mimic tear
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"vaati, you missed the biggest connection with verdigris. i type this as a jeweler, for whom verdigris is an everyday reality. verdigris in real life is also a protective layer that prevents moisture and oxygen from eating further into the copper. rust works similarly with iron. which brings me to my point. there's an everyday word used to describe verdigris, as none of us use the term in our industry. a verdigrous piece of copper you see, is simply referred to as tarnished."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,that lore isn't cooked! its rauh!!! kicks over golem
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"wow. vaati, i am honored and flattered to have been featured so heavily in this video. i am very happy that you found the night  flame video so inspiring. your production value and storytelling have been my number one inspirations when it comes to video making. i am grateful for the shoutout, and it's also cool to be featured alongside tarnished archaeologist, as he is an incredible theorist and has does phenomenal work in bringing the ancient history to light and illuminating the irl historical references that are all over this game. i think your peer review idea is a great one, and i think it would be cool for you to do those types of things in the future. you have the greatest trust  respect of the community, not to mention the reach, and your channel could become a place where you can highlight the best theories of the community, weaving together the most accurate story, as you suggested. i have my next video almost done, it will be released shortly. i hope you enjoy. if you ever want to chat, you know where to find me. thank you, again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,i often wonder if miyazaki watches these videos and thinks oh i didn't even think of that or they're uncovering this quite well or just laughs in amusement.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,something cool ice just noticed is how romina's abdomen of the scorpion and the centipede spiral together in a sense of divinity culminating into her at the top
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"verdigris, a.k.a. tarnishing. the repeated build up when exposed to harsh conditions that ultimately strengthens. you are the tarnished, you are verdigris, through your endless loops of life and death you become stronger"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"it's funny that we might actually now have a lore reason for the main character of a from software game being short. the first lords were titans, then giants and dragons, then your typical fromsoft boss characters who are like 10 feet tall, and now us. as the turns of the spiral get smaller towards the top, we have become the literal short king."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"something of note the ancient meteoric ore greatsword, unlike everything related to meteors, even the pitiful harpoons crated from scraps of meteorites wielded by claymen that use and require intelligence to wield, the ancient meteor greatsword uses arcane, this, and the white light, as opposed to the purple light of gravity magic that enwreathes weapons created from meteorites, sets it apart from all other meteoric weaponry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,i'm glad tarnished archeologist is getting broader recognition. they do some insane levels of analysis over there and i love it deeply.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"another interesting tidbit is that romina took on the aspect of a scorpion a known symbol of rot, but also took on the aspect of a centipede golden centipedes are referred to as divine, and centipedes are emblematic of divine death."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"golden centepides are commonly found in churches, and holy places. thus, romina being part centipede i think is related to her being an important figure of a holy church"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"i think it contributes to the mobile forge theory that the fire giant the player fights carries a dish on his shoulders in the same way as the golem smiths, possibly trying to mimic the previous owners of the forge without really grasping what the motion meant."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"i really love the collaborative nature of elden ring theories. thank you nameless singer, tarnished archeologist, and everyone else who pieced together this story."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"amazing, amazing video as normal. one idea i have  romina is the saint of the bud. rather than just referencing her church connections, i think she may have been a shaman like marika. it would explain how she was able to meld the centipede and scorpion into her own flesh and body since shamans have that property inherently, not to mention being in tune or related to the divine. she may have originally persecuted the hornsent alongside marikas army too and regretted it, then found the bud and started her life of penance, bringing back her own form of life"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"1612 here, you can hear vaati finally snapped"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,ruins of rauh is genuinely one of the most beautiful areas in the entire game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,4741 i love his comment as an australian on the spiderscorpions.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,never forget the first time i arrived at the rauh ruins. truly a once in a lifetime game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,the fact that primes secret level didnt have an elden ring episode is something i will never get over
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,yeah its boutta be in ruins after nameless king isekais into the lands between
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"in the real world, as in elden ring, objects distort space around them to create gravity. there isn't a reason for this. it's just the nature of the universe. in elden ring spirals channel energy. the medium doesn't matter. a godslayer sword, a building like enir elim or farum azula, pure glintstone sorcery, or even the horns of the hornsent all of them channel more energy than they otherwise should, because they are spiral shaped. that's the underlying meaning of the spiral motif. and i think you're right that it is also meant to evoke the double helix structure of dna."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,i'm thrilled that tarnished archaeologist is getting some love here. he's one of the best content creators in this whole community.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"at 3948 i think one of the better proof that this church is also of hornsent origin is simply romina's design and attacks. she is the saint of that church after all, and when you actually look at how romina looks, as well as her attacks, you notice that the spiral pattern is everywhere on her. she herself is a humanoid body, but the base of her body is a spiral that then unfolds into the scorpion and centipede parts. in her purification attack, and in some other moves, she curls her scorpion and centipede half back into a spiral underneath her which, when she raises the bud, resembles the spiral pillars that has a bud at their top. finally, her butterfly attacks, as well as the incantation we get, is also full of spirals that makes her twist upwards as she casts it, and those spirals, color excluded, is basically the same kind of spirals as the ones we see in the spiral incantations. even romina's hair is made of small spiral petals! and the way the centipede and scorpion halves of her both curve to each side, as if they came out of the spiraling pattern at the base of her body."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"the ruins being made out of blackstone is a parallel to the great empire of the dawn from asoiaf, an empire that preceeded yiti and the valyrian freehold and its contemporaries. and the thing with the great empire of the dawn is that many civilizations that came and went after them inherited and appropriated their blackstone monuments, the high tower of oldtown is made of blackstone, the ironborn throne... but also the architecture of valyria and plenty of abandoned ruins in sothoryos the southern continent that belonged to some a more recent civilization. seeing as grrm was in charge of this stuff it wouldn't be surprising if he took inspiration from his own work. so the old gods leaving their architecture behind to the blackstone civlization and so on is a direct parallel, especially since the first emperor of the dawn was said to be god on earth."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,probably vaatis brain is exploding trying to find a lore implication for nameless king being in er
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"4102 i love that you show the clip and reference that that woman is romina. i love it because it shows the reanimatory powers of rot and fermentation. it seems to me that romina burned and died in that place. but perhaps, as her body lay there and rotted, the fungus or whatever rotting mechanism changed her body into something more grotesque, even melding with surrounding corpses, into one fungal amalgamation. perhaps this is what grafting is so pitifully trying to imitate."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,never tapped a video so fast in my life to watch more lore
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"maybe i'm completely wrong here, but it seems like in the actual area of rauh, all the flowing water is happening on 1 side of the aquaduct, and the stagnant water is on the other side. almost like they intentionally created a bridge between life and death, separate, but willingly fed from one to the other. the rot ruins are physically lower. the stagnant water can't go back up to the waterfalls. there's no way to get back up to the upper ruins except via the area with the deathblight lion dancer. thinking about it, maybe that's intentional too. the idea of death coming back to life leading to deathblight."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"this was a very pleasant, calm and chill video. i particularly liked your choice of background music for this one i did love the video for it's content, as per usual, but after crying all the tears of my body while watching the end of arcane, i think i needed exactly this kind of relaxing content. so thanks you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,time to cook bro  your christmas bonus came early
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,copper being a defense against the rot makes a lot of sense. it has extremely strong antibacterial qualities and is toxic to most living things in fairly small amounts. verdigris is also opposite to the pinkish color of the rot on the color wheel.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,describing outer gods as kami is quite pertinent. since kamis themselves dont seem immune to corruption themselves if you dont pray and make offering to them. since rot got seemingly subjugated by force it might have came back in a more virulent form especially since the order of life got thrown out of wack with the removal of death.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"i think the lore of elden ring is, in essence, about the rise and fall of civilizations and empires. we get so many examples of ancient civilizations the old gods, rauh, titans, giants, astrologers, the ancestral ruins, ancient dragons, farum azula, etc. all of them are without direct explanation or reason for why they are there, and what they were like. i think thats on purose, though. despite all we know of ancient civilizations here in the real world, its all still an approximation using our best available evidence. lost civilizations and ruined empires don't need a detailed explanation, they just are. we even see a civilization that had just recently in relative terms fallen, the hornsent, and the civilization that the game takes place in, the golden order, is in the middle of falling. empires rise, fall, and get rediscovered by another civilization down the line. like coral, they build on the corpses of previous attempts before falling and getting built upon themselves. its all a repeating cycle, just like fromsoft always shows in their games."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,this was such a great video. rauh is one of my favorite areas in the dlc. leaving the shadow keep and walking out into the beautiful land of rauh was like leaving the catcombs and going into irithyll of the boreal valley. i always thought it was interesting that the sun shines on rauh and the veil isnt over those landseven though belurat and enid ilim are right next to it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"i think this might be my new favourite vaati vid, even topping the millicent and the first frenzied flame ones. as a lover of ancient history, this was such a cool and fascinating watch, with all the different theories and connections from different creators, as well as the input from the comments. absolutely loved this one. also, the music at 230 was so beautiful"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"vaati, brother. the world has been dark and cold and void of lore without you. you and the tarnished archaeologist are ultimate."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"i finally have a connection!! in nature, the size of a creature depends on the size of the land it inhabits. island creatures are basically always smaller than mainland ones. the lands between is fairly small, and also we know that a lot of the creatures on it are from the starsother worlds. i believe that over time, the inhabitants of the lands between shrunk as generations adapted to the smaller space. it explains why the titansgiants got smaller, mankind too. maybe everything was adjusted to cosmic size like astel maybe?, but over time evolved into smaller and smaller iterations."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,antone else think that the way the fire giant holds his bowl thing atop his shoulders looks kind of like how the smithing golems hold theirs?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"1101 man, the thought of a smithscript golem fist weapon sounds so good to me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,oh boy if you thought it was in ruins 2 weeks ago
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"hey vaati, one thing that i think is extremely interesting is that not only the rauh civilization lived in harmony with the flowing water and the stagnant water of the rot, but the rot beings themselves seemed to live in harmony with the spiral, wich is something that inherently incites the image of movement and that is something that is in direct contradiction with the stagnation of the rot. so to sum up these old civilizations and costumes i think that the perfect word is balance, and that is something that as you said in the video, fromsoftware likes to portray in the universes that they create, the idea that the oldest civilizations or forms of life used to live in harmony or balance, until something happened to disrupt the status quo."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,seeing that bear get absolutely folded at 154 made me smile like a madman. you get what you fucking deserve
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"2907 just a litte detail to remember is that rauh is the only area in game, that has a normal night and day sky that isnt tainted by gold or any other presence of an outer god."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,another excellent video. happy to see you shout out nameless singer. i've watched ns's videos a bunch of times. they're so fascinating.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,"855 i knew this worked on golems, watchdogs and imps but had no clue about the golem smith being affected. you1 and ta2 are the two best er lore channels keep it up"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,a golem has holes where you insert the instructions. the only film i've come across which shows this accurately is oddity.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,dopamine drip engage
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,can't wait to see tarnished archaeologist's take on rauh ruins.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,worth noting that the butterflies and other elements of scarlet rot in rauh are all a completely different color bright magenta vs the slightly orangered. we know colors usually mean more than just being pretty to look at in elden ring they very frequently form associations that matter. this supports the idea that the rot in rauh is basically frozen at some point in time before the rot we know in the lands between became what we know  like divergent points in evolving species.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-25,"2346 i love how this shot looks like a hand holding the divine tower,, so cool"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"sees fire keeper, namles king and centipede demon in new elden ring ... something ... nope, i will just wait for vatii to explain what is going on."

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,"it is amazing how deep and rich this game is, and the patience you guys have to try to uncover all the secrets inside the game. for real, i am sooo thankfull for you your channel and your team. without you guys i would notice all this little details that are amzingly beautiful. i am more the playthrough for the epic bossfights type of player and dont realy have the motivation to do all this research. so once agains. from the bottom of my heart, ty sir. you and your team make me love the game more and more each time you upload a new video"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,good chance vaati is losing his mind over the nightreign trailer. cant wait to see what he theorizes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,everybody wake up! vaati just dropped his next jewel!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,new vaati and new kendrick in the same day??
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-29,what an intro! i was hooked from the first minute alone. i hope you keep doing this series on the nightreign expansion as well.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,title checks out with ds3 bosses in elden ring now
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,imagine this exact same video but every time he says rauh gordon ramsey's angry face flashes for exactly 1 frame.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,vaati they hit the lands between with another elden ring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,can't wait to see bro's reaction at the nameless king in elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"vaati, my hats off to you. you were really cooking in this video, and i'm loving it! loved the incorporation of ta's lore as well. thank you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,2818 i appreciate you putting the lore quotes on screen. please keep that up in the future. also with all this unanswered lore we better get elden ring 2 within the next five years
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"hits blunt the number eight is important because it sits between seven and nine, and 79 is the atomic number for gold, which in latin is aurum, and is most closely associated with light and perfection."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"to add on about the octagonal and 8sided iconography, it appears in a few different places, with some interesting implications. notably, the cape of the dragonkin soldier, and the floor where rennala lays. the astrologer rises also share octagonal architecture. my theory is that it does indeed represent different forms of starworship. one idea i had is that the fell god used to be the sun, and the fact it's now represented by jupiter, a gas giant, represents the sun, a star, losing it's ability to shine golden light, possible due to entropy. it could be the link between nox, rauh, and giant civilizations, wherein they all worshipped stars in one way or another, whether the sun or the primeval current. also makes me think the primeval current is the galaxy, and the primordial crucible is the sun, both stars."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,bro is property having an aneurysm trying to comprehend what the nameless king is doing lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,"now this is the best video of elden ring youve made so far. i love talking about the ancient ancient past, because so much of it can tell us things that can change everything we know about the lore as a whole. love ya vaati"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,"rauh is my favorite place to idle in the dlc. very beautiful, lots of nature, amazing sky"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,vaaaatttiii!!!!! make a video on why the nameless king appears in the new eldenring trailer and my life is yours!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"lore man, lore man.. nightreign is upon us"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,vaati and kendrick drop on the same day we are eating
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,"so glad ta is getting the recognition he deserves, always come out of his videos learning more about the real world."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"vaatiiiii. my mental health was going down again, but again, this quality video lifted my mood. thank youuuu!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,with this nightreign the lore of elden ring is in ruins literally 000
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"what if the titans built the giant's forge to commune with the fell god, and the massive cataclysm that wiped the titans out, was the fell god showing up into the forge."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,vaati about to start cooking
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,these videos are always such a joy to watch. they really enhance my saturday mornings.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"something that might be worth mentioning is that the names of the crucible knights are named after earth's prehistorical time periods ordovician, silurian and devonian, further strengthening the connection of the crucible to evolution and mutation and the spirals being an analogy to the dna"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,vaati. nameless king in new elden ring game. i need answers.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,vaaaaaaaati!!!! where are you?!??!! new trailer!!!!  we need you!!!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,black stone ruins remind me that in martin's asoiaf series the most ancient remains of civilizations are made of black stones. iirc they are a reference to lovecraftian stories.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,"was just thinking i haven't watched a lore video in awhile, best day ever!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,its fun to see how tarnished archeologist has impacted souls analysis.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"vaati where are you? nightreign trailer was released yesterday i'm counting on you, sir."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"i noticed that the blackstone pillars reach far into the earth, as seen for example in the jar jails. it's like they were built as a skeleton for the entire world to hold on to."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,"something you may find interesting, vaati... so when i first started playing er, i was also exploring and studying the history of judeochristian religion, including abandoned apocrypha, and religions that had relation to them overtime. as such, i believe that someone fromsoft may also have extensive familiarity with the same information. knowing some of that actually led me to some conclusions that i don't think were justified until the soe. i think you hit the nail on the head when you stated that the outer gods aren't so much gods at all, but rather manifestations of the natural order. to me, er lore takes the blueprint of judeochristian beliefs, and seems to beautifully expound on them allegorically. as for the spiral, i can't remember where i read it, but there was an old catholic belief that to be in the pressence of god was like being in the midst of an ascending spiral, wreathed in flame"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,hey vaatii! just wanted to let you know that i have to write an essay on zombies at university and i was thinking of going inot the concept of death in elden ring or other souls games. you make these stories so interesting and serve as an inspiration thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,wake up vati
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,the title of this video is literal now lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,vaati looks like the new one won't have such lore
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,"i do love this idea that all life in this world is physically shrinking as time goes by. it makes me wonder how big the lands between will seem in the farflung future, and how tiny they must've been to the titans. seriously, this place is like a college dorm to them."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"an interesting thing to note is some golems carry their forges on their heads, and the idle stance of the fire giant boss mimics that stance, with it's possibly verdigris shield acting as a 'crucible' of sorts."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,1553 you know what else is massive
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,alright vaati wheres the er night reign vid
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"kami are spirits that embody natural forces or features. if kami do exist in elden ring then that would explain how a river can also be a spirit. the siofra is a physical river, but it is also embodied by a spirit that taught martial arts to malenia's sword master. the ancestral spirits would be the spectral instantiation of the cycle of life and death in the areas inhabited by the ancestral followers, and so on. it actually explains a lot."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,maybe the real crucible was the ragequits we had along the way
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-01,thx for taking out the spooky voices that would jump scare me whilst trying to sleep watching some of your older videos

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,pretty sure every player died at watch your step.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"when you jump on and land, but you thought you wouldn't, so you jump again, so you try to turn back mid jump, and you think you'll miss it again so you jump again, but you didn't miss it so you try to turn back again and you fall and die."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,they shouldve made it soap rather than a skadoosh fragment for the ultimate betrayal

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,im always good on the jump onto the statue. then i mess up the jump back.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,i could only ever make that jump from the far side of the item. not sure if it was designed that way or not but one side was definitely easier to make
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"i think i know where it is, it just i dont remember the name. its in dlc area where you can get queglin greatsword i dont even remember the npc name"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,wipeout elden ring edition
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,dide is that a song from dk64 in the background lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,it's just fire grease

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i know exactly where this sht is.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,its so sad that i know exactly where this is
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,just mushrooms
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,sounds like op has insane beef and copium on a skill issue
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"this game was made to piss you off. beat it, delete it, play some mario 64 for therapy and move on."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,try jumping in dark souls 13 if this one was already awful for you
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,ds3 with a controller.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,the worst fragment in the dlc
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i hate that dlc area so much
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,?
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,i wand a refund of that game
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,jajajajajj
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,completely made up! there is no such problem!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,kkkkkkkk
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,i watch your channel with pleasure. your videos carry interesting and engaging ideas.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,fromsoft misunderstood the community when they saw all the fort night messages on the ground.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"all those try fort, night messages were a prophecy"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"for a game that's recycling enemies, that margit invasion bit makes me actually want the pursuer to show up cause this seems made for that type of invading boss"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,good for torrent for taking a vacation. he deserves to have some fun.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,1426 that miner was simply doing the golden order totality emote... deepest lore...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i can't believe they're not including the true boss, gravity. it's been in every other game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"we need a new totally unique boss, any ideas? ok so get this we take a four legged animal... and we give it a sword. fuck that's genius, let's never stop doing that ever."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"my biggest worry is what the rest of the game is. not the extra bosses and maps, but what happens after a run. is there any carry over to the next run? any upgrades? any story beats? more unlocks for the next run? i haven't seen anything that dicussions of that part of the gameloop. what's going to keep me invested from run to run?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i think the idea of nightreign as a training project allowing the team to play around with new ideas and giving new team members experience in handling a project on their own factors a lot more into this than people are giving it credit for. the triplea industry is cannibalizing itself because nobody can keep staff for long enough to build a studio capable of making a triplea game. fromsoft letting the team work on projects like nightreign lets them get smaller infusions of cash with more modest projects while training their people on stuff they don't have to close a studio down for if it flops. it's far smarter than most other companies are being these days, honestly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,305 i know waaay too many people who would go hang on i need to think about this and would probably spend half an hour figuring out and arguing over his own stats.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"if this event was at the vegas convention center, the connection issues were likely the convention center's fault. infrastructure there sucks ass and they never do anything to improve it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,i appreciate the brutal honesty here. even when youtubers aren't under strict contract it feels like a lot of the time theyd rather stay in the good graces of a company than be honest but its clear you value your journalism over the company. not saying it seemed like you disliked it but you were honest about your reservations and the problems with the event and i respect that.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,the disconnect thing is a problem even if it was just the wifi. a reconnect is a needed feature for things like this. edit if you have a first hand account of fromsoft working on or having a solution about the disconnect problem please share it. because it's a weird oversight and if online for everyone was 100 reliable always this wouldn't be a problem.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"bro, a passive ability that automatically casts fireballs just for slow walking is such a power move. imagine slow walking onto the scene and just owning everything without even attacking..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"the most compelling thing about this game is what you cited at the end. in elden ring, you mostly use like 5 of what you find during a playthrough, but in this game and you having to use what you find, it makes the gameplay much more diverse than the main game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"someone said this should've been an armored core game and i haven't slept right since , they're just correct"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"as someone who works computer industry events, relying on venue wifi for a game event that needs consistent connectivity is wild. glad you noted that the euro event didn't suffer from that problem."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,1600 the idea of fromsoft revisiting a boss they made more than a decade ago and giving them a new moveset is strangely cool and exciting
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"hookshot, three day limit? this is the majora's mask of dark souls."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,this is a really good review man. thank you for it. very detailed  knocked on all the points i was interested in
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"with the return of some bosses, itd be interesting to see the return of old npcs as playable characters. yeah im a maneater mildred main"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,"i'm really appreciative of how open and honest you gave this impression review. thank you, pineapple man"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"honestly, i'd like to see a set of variants of each character. like the duchess being pure dex, or arcane dex, or maybe even pure arcane leaning into her ability. that could change their stat distribution without having to force different suboptimal builds. would increase replayability as well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,nothing says stress like elden ring with a time limit.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"having spent some time helping people in boss fights in er i can already see how it would go with randoms you load in a session, get to the first boss, they try to spam it to death and inevitably end up dying themselves and then you're left running around trying to revive them. i can see them going off on their own, grabbing loot from the ground that they shouldn't, etc. this is potentially a nightmare to play with randoms and no comms."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,"youre one of my favorite game reviewers, your delivery is concise, clear, and engaging and you always keep as objective as you can while still injecting the subjective fun you personally had"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,this game sounds like a nightmare if played with strangers
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,the wrapup hit all the points i had floating around in my head. cool.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,"my main issue with elden ring's magic system was that it encourages you to stick to only a couple of spells during a fight without adding much mechanical complexity that could influence the spell choice to be fair, this is coming from a noita player. with this in mind, the recluse seems really cool and like it encourages this sort of complex decision making around spell choices that i was missing!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"it's not just the faster sprint that helps exploration. the hawks, too, are very cool addition and looks really fun to use"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,the recluse's magic cocktail ability is probably the coolest thing i've ever seen in terms of fromsoft combat. it's like some combination of the monster hunter kinsect glaive and invoker's spell combos from dota 2.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,im honestly really looking forward to this. i had a lot of fun in the test and im excited to see all the other characters and bosses in the final game and dlc.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"now im even more intrigued about solo play. while coop is the main selling point, i think solo runs are going to be important aswell."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i think this is one of the better reviews you've done. i think you were fair, well spoken, and you provided some really good feedback. nice work!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"inb4 modding wizards implement nightreign movement and mechanics like mantling, super sprint, wallclimbing, the spectral hawk glider, being able to use spirit jumps without torrent and class abilities hell, maybe even a race system since the guardian is like a dnd aarakocra into the main elden ring game. edit people really get this mad over a demo. absurd."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,"i honestly enjoy it a lot. it's elden ring gameplay but with a roguelike filter, i.e. randomized encounters with random upgrades. i've had a few days on the network test now and it's taken a little while to adapt to but it's super fun."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,thank you for actually explaining wtf this game actually is within those first 40 seconds. i've been struggling to get a coherent exploration about what the hell this game is for entirely too long
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"1903 the sky is beautiful also, appreciate the hard work putting this video together and going over so many topics in depth. especially the recluse's magic gathering ability!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i really really hope they change their mind and allow for 2 player parties. my cousin and i have been teaming up for these games since dark souls, and we dont wanna have to account for a third rando."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,"this game needs cross play, a game based on co op without cross play is insane to me, actually nuts"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"what i like about the guardian is that if you look at his left wing you can viably see that its smaller, crippled and bloody compared to the healthy looking right one. i like this a lot because it efficiently shows dont tells us about his lore and character without necessarily needing an item description saying why he cant fly around everywhere all the time. also his tower shield is positioned to guard his broken wing which i find very endearing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,610 pilebunker bros we are so back
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,t posing miner is the secret boss for the true ending
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,cant wait for modders to implement all these movement option into elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"it definitely looks like a fun side project, some ppl act like it's supposed to be the next big fromsoft game but it doesn't seem like it from what has been showed. it isn't even full price which helps push that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,im honestly less excited about the game itself and more excited for the assets that modders will have access to.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,i played 8 nightreign like games
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,"this was a great video bro, sorry for the generic comment but i actually enjoyed the way you edited it and laid it all out for us and weren't annoying at all. thank you."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"as someone who has coop all the souls games with my friends time and time again, i cant imagine how tiring a desync with no connect is gonna get espically if your 3040 mins into a run and its over. i can imagine everyone will be able to speedrun the first day cause of familiarity due to connectivity issues."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,even if it's not for me i still think it's cool that their experimenting and trying new things in what looks like a side project. it reminds me of all the cool mods to games we had back in the day that eventually became their own games like counter strike and dota.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i have to say, a lot of this just looks like the elden ring enemies we've been fighting over and over again. i would've loved for them to mix in also ds1ds3 enemies instead of just a few boss cameos. people are going to complain about asset reuse anyway, why not make the switch from elden ring to nightreign a bit more fresh? oh well."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"honestly this feels like theyre trying out new directions for games under the protection an established franchise. just from this video alone, nightreign seems like a straight up fanmod of elden ring  dark souls assets."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"no way to reconnect is a huge problem, there need to be a away to rejoin a dropped game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,no crossplay and no duo is just brutal. i want to play it but idk how now lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"the way i look at the reuse of assets from old games is sort of the way that i look at some of the older monster hunter titles. monster hunter generations basically ported most of the monsters from all of the previous games into that one, while adding new stuff and making things unique. it didn't feel like an asset flip, but more of a celebration of the success and trials associated with past games. i can only hope that nightreign does a similar thing, celebrating the history of fromsoft while also putting on a new coat of paint to keep things interesting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"very nice, detailed preview. i feel like i learned a lot about what to expect. thank you!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"haven't clicked on a video this fast in a while. thank you for the extensive preview, i can't wait to play on the network test."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"pretty impressive that you can gather so much information in one gaming session. in all honesty, the game didn't catch my attention too much when i first heard it but now i'm all in. good job as always"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"man, i should've clicked that youtube link in your twitter bio years ago when i followed you. quality review, perfectly showcasing every bit of those brolls. thanks for you honest input and your great diction ! a pleasure to watch !"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,imagine being with your buddie about to open a loot chest only for a mimic to reck your day lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i always appreciate the honesty without cynicism. i totally get the apprehension that comes to mind with elden ring, and roguelike in the same sentences, but i think provided the good elements can be expanded upon more in the full release, this will at the least be something fun to pick up with friends on occasion. though given the amount of reused assets, remixed or not, that 40 on launch feels like a bit much, let alone trying to sell a deluxe edition for an extra 15, even if no doubt the ability to get the dlc separately later will be a thing. cautiously optimistic feels like a good place to be for now. cheers, pine!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"this feels like it was made for me and my little group of friends, there's three of us and we love playing games cooperatively like this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i love souls games. but i always play solo. nightreign looks cool, but the idea of playing online with strangers...shudder. i know it can be played solo, but it doesn't seem like it's tuned for that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"imagine you're having a really good run, you have good weapons and buffs and you're fighting a really strong boss that you know will give you everything you need for the final boss. then, out of nowhere you hear put those foolish ambitions to rest and you get teamwiped"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,three days?! termina is upon us!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"nice to see the classes more. feeling a lot more like i won't permanently stick to one, now"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,this is going to be zullie's main. made me chuckle haha. game is looking interesting. i'm all for more elden ring!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-18,"honestly, this looks like a hoot to play with friends. im gonna be that pigeon man."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"when i asked the rep about how the map would change, or if there were other maps, they were pretty cagey bro that map is not changing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"while i do see this as a building block game, where other new mechanics might find their way to the next game, i'm definitely optimistic about this gameplay loop in general. thank you again for your thorough preview, it definitely helps give a foothold on will i like this? ."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"there is so much potential for expansion here more bosses  original and recycled from past games  more weapons, more weapon types, more locations, more random events, more characters. i hope from smooths out some of the jagged edges make two player coop an option, make things scale down if a player disconnects, allow a disconnected player to reconnect and have things scale back up. i can easily see dropping a few dozen hours on this solo, and god knows how many with some buddies."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,man that wall climbing ability would've been nice the og elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"i'm excited to play nightreign, but i'm also excited to see just how much of it gets backported into elden ring via mods. literal modders haven with all this stuff."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"im excited to play it, but i still cant wrap my head around this being an actual official from soft product. its such a bizarre departure from their usual stuff while also being exactly the same? like you said, it feels like an extremely higheffort mod project"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"this game's press release has been a roller coaster for me. from ultrahype from the early trailers before i realized the gameplay loop, to total disinterest, to cautious optimism be cause we know fromsoft are all about iterating on their previous work, meaning all the fun fastpaced stuff from this one is likely to appear in their next flagship game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"nightreign actually feels pretty unique from what i played of the beta, with the different classes with their own special abilities it stands out more than elden ring itself that at most times just felt like big dark souls"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"you and vaati posting the same video at exactly the same time has me convinced that you're secretly the same person. it's like fight club, but you're tyler durden."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"this seems fun ngl, and the way it's set up can allow for more characters to be added."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,i appreciate your opinions so much. very reasonable and well spoken.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,iron pineapple always coming in clutch with the nuanced examination. your perspective and analysis is always greatly appreciated!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"speaking as someone who loves risk of rain 2, this game gives me a lot of those vibes and i'm very here for that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i love everything i'm seeing here. even if nightreign itself might just be a 710, i love the experimentation on display. the sorcerer looks really fun and exactly like what i've always wanted them to do with the magic system. bosses designed for coop are a dream come true, i spent so many hours with jolly cooperation in the other games. also the character designs are all really cool, the wings on the tank are so sleek! very exciting direction to take the base combat loop we all love, it's exactly the mixup the formula needs imho."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"the idea of iron pineapple, oroboro, and lobosjr in coop feels like a fever dream, i've been watching all of you guys since ds1 and more than once i've imagined this exact scenario."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,id love to see soc as one of the night lords
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"from the beginning i suspected that the basic structure of this game would necessarily remove many of the core aspects of what i enjoy about the soulsborne series. the more i see and hear about it, the more confident i am that's the case. doesn't look bad or like a cheap cash grab, but probably not something i'll enjoy especially not at a 40 price point, even as a huge fan of elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,i just think solo or trio with no option for duo is dumb af
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"the amount of time stamps is insane, love it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"i'm new here and appreciate your feedback. i played the beta and got to be honest, i enjoyed it. it seemed like an addon to the original game and that's not a bad thing. gameplay and randoms were actually friendly and we were all kind of learning how things work. personally believe this will be a nice addition to anyone's gaming collection."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"this is imaginative, ambitious, it's interesting. i don't think it's necessarily good yet, but i think the experimentation could lead to something amazing...i'd love a fromsoft mmo...also the beautiful artstyle of the fromsoft games in a more fast paced gaming environment looks really beautiful. i'd like to see what they do after this game! sidenote being able to play as the bad souls bitches is a huge plus"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"a thing i loved about bloodborne and sekiro was clearing a level from enemies and then slow walk through it, just ingesting the atmosphere and details. i guess that game wont be able to do that by its nature. on the other hand, i am stoked for fromsoft trying to change things up once in a while and as a developer myself, its a huge sign of respect to let teammembers do their own thing once in a while. i feel like miyazaki is a good leader and thus my trust in the company is maintained, even if it doesnt serve my ego wishes."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"for anyone not familiar with this style of games, i recommend playing things like blazblue entropy effect, astral ascent or any action focused roguelites that should give you an idea of what the gameplay loop is like. the deluxe edition says there will be new characters and bosses, so we will see new content. i hope that's the case, since i want new enemies and mini bosses that would help with the enemy reuse we're seeing."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,my opinion on why fromsoft is doing this is to see how a full coop experience would work in a dark souls like setting. its very possible the next souls like game from them will be full coop which i would absolutely love.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i really like the idea of taking the mechanics and assets of a game and making some weird, entirely different experience with it. this sort of experimentation is so rare with how risk averse publishers are. pretty interested"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"i love it, the way they change the combat and movement mechanics totally means the fights you have with friends will always be an epic battle"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,the door reminds me of the throne of want tbh.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,bringing back the ds2 mechanic to be able to hit bosses during grab attacks is quite nice as i no longer have to sit and watch my buddy lose half his health bar because he cant dodge the most choreographed attack in the game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"i'm scared of the technical issues you mentioned. i really, really hope they fix it for launch because it is make or break in terms of critical and audience reception. this sounds like such a cool concept too"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,this feels like its probably gonna fun for 2 days and then when you ask your friends to play again they will go eh
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,i'm happy people are criticizing the netcode since their whole infrastructure needs an update. it is super obvious in armored core with the phantom hits out of nowhere.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,"its different but i dig it, with a busy schedule i appreciate these shorter sessions. i don't have time to explore elden like i used to sadly."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,what boss honestly in any game gave you the most trouble??? i'm curious lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-23,only a genius like miyazaki could think of such a creative mechanic as a final boss attacking your framerate directly.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,im still the elden lord things i said before dying 12 times in a row to the first enemy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,"the funny thing is that since elden ring was my first game and i didnt use the wiki, i went into multiple areas under levels during my first play through, so the dlc isnt actually that different then what i was experiencing during elden ring lol. and i love it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-12,"the fragments are a cool system on your first playthrough because they make you explore, but on any subsequent playthroughs its like doing chores before getting to actually play the game."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,the rotoscoping was so funny
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"the scadutree fragments arent even there just to make the dlc easier. its the dlcs level up system. not using them and then complaining about how hard it is, is like playing the base game at sl1 your first time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,bros spine is a glow stick 023
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,030 yo that was smooth as heck
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,you know for as much as i enjoy the shorter skit videos my favorites will always be these longer breakdown type videos!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"nothing will ever take away from my experience of reaching radahn's second phase just to see him and his miquellester brother tpose in my face and levitate to then nuke me with a light spell equivalent to a carpetbombing of flash granades. if that wasn't peak fiction, nothing is"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,i'm still miffed that the dlc has no intro cutscene. like you're just in the land of shadow.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-02,"oh my sweet promised consort radahn, how i miss thee... with my sword because you negated my build entirely. oh how i miss thee."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,the one item that fractured elden ring's fanbase was deodorant.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"if they're spamming a move that always kills you, you're spamming a mistake. excellent line"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,that handshake was immaculate
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-01,this is my first video ive ever seen by this guy and i immediately subscribed. fantastic animation and comedy mixed with genuinely good information and just the right amount of self flagellation. we need more youtubers like this.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"the miyazaki quote at 1015 changed the way i played elden ring. i was less stubborn about what i allowed myself to use and had a much better time. this is my 9th character, but it was the first i got through godfrey on."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"i think the main reason people complained is that they were expecting the dlc to be an extension of the main game, but instead they got basically a new game. granted, running across the map for seeds and tears is the most tedious part of starting a new character, but that's just part of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,030 this whole bit. this bit right here with the hands. hats off to you right here! like you didn't even cheat with the 4 fingies. you just animated the whole thing and it looked natural.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,bold of you to assume i have a fraction of tortellinis gaming prowess.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,still kinda crazy that pointcrow's fish beat malenia
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,"148 honestly i sympathize with the guy who doesn't even have a hot take, he's just confused lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"fun bit about skadoosh fragments, they have a soft cap too! blessings after 12 are only about 20 as effective, so while it can feel bad not to have gotten everything, you need less than half the total fragments to hit 12 and be okay."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"712 i really like that elden beast, so cute. just doing his little happy dance without a care in the world. thanks for the video."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"while the dark souls 2 death door seems like a troll moment, it's actually a shortcut. you can roll into it from above, which skips the guards on the upper floor if you need to go back there. a precise little action that will probably kill you a couple times before you get it right, so maybe don't bother. but there's purpose to it, y'know."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,"loved that the dlc always had several paths open for me to take till nearly the end. it really supports that exploration feeling and was ok for my level being overleveled still is beneficial as everything is altered on percents, so its not like all those hours leveling are lost."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"it happened with spirit ashes, it happened with nerfs, it happened with scadu fragments and it'll keep happening, but not one of us will ever stop playing"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,it took me 6 hours to find the level up lady. i had cleared the weeping peninsula and hadnt found a weapon or armor or clothes yet. i did have 7 cookbooks on me. i still do not know how to cook.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-09,this might be the single most entertaining video ive seen all year on yt. circletoonss style never ceases to entrance my adhd brain
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-23,"as was briefly mentioned, i think the biggest issue with the scadutree fragment system is that you have to collect every fragment if you want to get to max level. this differs from the golden seed system which has a surplus. this means you dont have to scour the entire map or go through a guide to get all your flasks unlike the scadutree system."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,030 thats a clean rotoscope right there.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"804 i saw her beat the same bosses simultaneously, one with the dance pad and the other with a controller which is insane"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-04,goated sam cameo  750
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"imo more scadutree fragmentsspirit ashes should have been tied to beating fieldmain bosses, and rewards at the end of dungeons, rather than random pot enemies or corners of the land of shadow. it would have given a better incentive on repeat playthroughs to engage with more of the interesting content in the dlc if you wanted to become stronger, rather than just finding the path that makes you the most optimally powerful while doing nothing but horse riding around the map doing fragmentash collecting."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"the scadutree fragments were the loudest part of the discussion, but usually the loudest part of the discussion is only that way because its easy to point to and requires little thinking about the topic. in other words, its usually the wrong focus. there are genuine criticisms to be made about sote, namely enemy design. i think the one most people immediately think of is radahn, but i want to focus on something smaller divine beast warriors the lion guys in the final area, and curseblades the spinning dual blade guys with a thousand combos, you get ambushed by one upon almost immediately entering gravesite plain. these two enemies in particular are hard for the sake of being hard. there is a lot of spectacle to them like most things in elden ring, which is fine, but if you can tell me you find fighting them fun with a straight face i wouldnt believe you. theyre cool enemies, thats about where the praise ends for most people. for one, the poise on both enemies is through the roof meaning stance breaking them is going to be difficult. on top of that getting them to flinch is extremely difficult depending on what move theyre using i dont even think the divine warriors can flinch. to make matters worse both enemies are extremely mobile with long combos and very short dodge windows. sound familiar? all the same problems as radahn. for reference, i played through the dlc as a strength character and switched between greatsword and ancient meteoric ore greatsword, scadutree level of 19. on my first playthrough of the dlc i tried to fight them as i came across them. eventually i just started running past them because its easier and not a drain on resources, especially since they are common enemies. i learned that a lot of people had similar experiences. so do i think that all the dlc enemies are this way? no, in fact i think messmers forces are some of the better designed ones. this is more or less a problem with hornsent enemies and the endgame area specifically, but i think its indicative of an underlying problem in the dlc that some enemies are just hard for the sake of being hard and thats a problem. when you created an enemy that the player would rather run past than fight straight up thats an issue and your enemy design effectively failed. and i think to some degree the devs knew the player would want to run past these enemies which is why they are highly mobile so they can cut you off, and have devastating ranged attacks if you try to speedily exit their sphere of influence."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"i have to hard disagree. i didn't avoid scadutree fragments, i didn't beeline towards bosses. i played like you suggested, exploring around. and what i found was wall after wall after wall. oh ok, this guy can take 200 hits, and also one shots me, so i should go the other direction until i'm stronger... oh, this direction has a different guy who is the same strength and is even faster... ok maybe i sneak by them and oh, no no this is a major dungeon, this is beyond my level right now. maybe some minor dungeons to get stronger first would be good? oh nope, this random hole in the ground has a knight with a crossbow that is also hundreds of times stronger than me. like ok where the hell am i supposed to go to get stronger? every direction is a wall. and before you say that souls players are meant to like a challenge, i am a decade long souls player wiht 100 completion in every game, i know the deal. i know you're supposed to learn a boss's moveset and get good at fighting them. but, when that damn lion one shots me, i never live long enough to learn the moveset. and when i leave to hunt down scadutree fragments for hours and come back with an extra 2, and it still one shots me, because the difference between 0 and 3 high as you can get in the area is only 0.092 damage reduction. that's just not balanced right! i can't learn shit by dying to the first hit all the time! people always jump to the just get tree fragments bro argument, the difference is just extremely minimal to the point of being unoticeable. even collecting fifty fragments every fragment in the game only gets you a 0.487x defence buff. it's not about it being hard, it's about it being unfair. a hard boss i can handle, i can figure it out, i can beat it. a twinblade knight who demands perfect dodging for followup attacks 150 times in a row that will end the fight on the first mistake by one shotting you just isn't fair. no souls game before has been like this. people praised ds1 for herding the player in the right direction without a quest marker by making two of the three routes available to you new londo and the catacombs freakishly hard, which naturally guided you towards the undead burg. the thing is, the dlc doesn't naturally guide you anywhere. it's all just as hard as the rest of it. that's bad."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"people really dont know the difference between difficult but fair and difficult but unfair. the latter is what i thought of a lot of shadows and even a lot of the late game of the base game. i think fromsoft has been slacking on actual balancing in favor of escalating the ever growing difficulty curve soul veterans expect as they get better and better at souls games, to the point where the game will just become blatantly unfair, best example from the base game i can think of is waterfowl dance. and prenerf consort radahn was an absolute mess in shadows, even for a final boss, the anime light show is just ridiculous."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-21,"between this, helldivers, and space marine 2, i feel like everyone has turned into a games journalist"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,ouch! my elden spleen!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-24,the reason i dont use everything at my disposal is half of the buffs and consumables negate the other half. and it isnt explained well in the game which negate what.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,bro im so happy you do exactly the same thing i do when it comes to my first time playing a game or just doing something in general.i dont watch its commercials or yt videos about it i just play it without all that stuff so i can experience it first hand
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,611 i hate overcomplicated visual gags that cause you to have to pause the video to be able to see it and then you realize it's not even worth it to pause in the first place lol got me there
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,the handshake was the best part of this video fr.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,it feels strange to be critical of a fanbase claiming the game is too hard while showing evidence that not playing the game a specific way would... well.. make it hard. i think that's my grip with elden ring as a whole. i've seen plenty of people struggle with the game but the ones that haven't happily chime in to say it's too easy while spamming dual wielding jumps and buffing themselves to hell and back. my experience was the same  i struggled with some of the bosses but once i coopted some of the bs i saw online the game became almost laughably easy. you're right in that games like sekiro doesn't offer builds but the positive element that provides is that everyone experiences the same struggle. issues like this will always be a problem with games like elden ring  especially when so many of the weaponbuild options in the game are presented as decent but turn out to be hot garbage.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,805 dont underestimate tortellini you could never scale up to him.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-27,"my issue is not difficulty, it's that all fromsoft can think to do to add difficulty is increase stats and extend boss combos and tracking but maintain the same core mechanics. all the options you have are to either spend more time dodgingblocking, sometimes parry, and waiting or essentially nerf the difficulty with magic or spirits. none of it is truly increasing your moment to moment choices and actions. wukong reminded me that i'm not sick of the souls formula i'm just sick of elden ring. you can have bosses that have crazy acrobatics and combos if you give the player a bunch of abilities to combine and use as they like to combat it like in wukong as well as having exploration that actually leads to cool encounters or useful items and not reskins or useless crafting items. but just being able to dodge, block, distract agro, or essentially nuke a boss isn't cutting it anymore for me. even stranger as fromsoft made sekiro, which was a fantastic evolution of the design when in the moment combat was the focus so they clearly can do it differently."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,i didnt have much problems at all prior to the final bosspre nerfs. i legitimately think phase 2 was a huge issue not only because it was hard but the flashes gave me huge eye strain and threatened my epilepsy. the skibiditrees are honestly a cool idea and i can totally imagine people not reading the prompts and then complaining online they got filtered.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,214 a thing i loved about sekiro is that youre playing as the literal definition of a coked out glass canon fighting against coked out regular canons i loved it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,this is the best animated video game video essay that was posted on september 21st 2024
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,my main issue with it was all the npcs just dissapearing cause i progressed the main story...like wtff half the content just gone...
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"my only real critic no the dlc is the frienzied forest that has only one boss and no varient of other bosses that we see pretty much everywhere. like the place is near dragon peak and we have no frienzied dragon! and like, i'm fine with walking a whole 8th of the map on foot, but give me some bosses at least. i wanted to see how scary the frienziness is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-24,713 that final bastard is adorable
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-26,that handshake at the beginning was incredible. dap me up miquella.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"the problem with scadutree fragments is that unlike any other fromsoft dlc released before, which relied solely on new enemies and bosses with new and more difficult movesetsgimmicks, this one relied on find 40 golden seeds 2.0 to not get 1shot by everything in this dlc while dealing as much damage as a wet noodle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,people didint have a problem with the difficulty they had a problem with why it was difficult
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-24,336 please sponge bob not my search history noooo
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"i personally feel like the scadu tree frags are too much of a departure from normal elden ring gameplay and level progression since unlike the base game where the effect of leveling was more of a linear and subtle climb whereas the treef rags are more like exponential rock walls and act more like a hard cap to your progression. yes you can obviously brute force your way through the, but with the much more aggressive boss design of the dlc, the excessive particle effects for some, and tge drastic weakening of your character the act of learning is much more mitigated and forces you to not engage with arguably the core part of the game, the bosses, until you've gone out of your way to grind the tree frags for a bit. while i don't think a game like this shouldn't be without grinding, the much more limited and niche nature of the tree frags, compared to the souls of the base game, make it hard to find the game enjoyable since it's such a departure. it's like playing a game where after every boss you have to find and replace all your gear and weapons with objectively better versions of the same gear, with no mechanical alterations or differences or additions, to progress instead of slowly increasing the power of the already existing components."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"there needed to be redundant fragments, the main issue is for me is unlike seeds or tears that allow you to miss a couple, you missing one fragment you cant get max level. the random glowy pot shadow dude having a shard was a proper wtf moment for me. i just used a guide after that cos i was not going to go back through the whole dlc, going to every shadow pot guy group in the hopes one might have a little sparkle effect."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-24,"skipping out on that last boss talk huh? well, i agree, but there are places in the game that do feel unfair. the many things that elden ring has been parodied for, and criticised for is made worse in the dlc. for example, bosses delay their animations even more, making their moves less natural and nonsensical. there are multitudes of moves that are just there for the visual flair, while the same exact visual flair on another boss actually damages you. joseph anderson probably has the best longwinded review of the dlc, and in short he explains the dlc as gym goer who has trained incredibly well looking very good, but look down and you see he totally skipped leg day."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"the true tragedy of the dlc is that many players will do everything from soft wanted, still struggle with the game and then when they go look for help get compared to a goldfish. also prenerf bosses were bullshit. you can't tell me the final boss' halfframerate reducer and halfflashbang attack that made it impossible to see what the fuck was going on even on new topspec hardware was even remotely fair"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"i think the idea of just throw everything at you can all at once at the boss after learning most if not all of the attacks and the weaknesses and times to attack and to runhide is the best, since it means you already know what might happen but you are much stronger, and even if you don't win 1st try, it just means the time you kill it is more satisfying. also your friend being able to kill the final boss without moving is wild lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,1052 thats a quote from arrowhead games commonly known for making helldivers
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"i simply feel like the quality of bosses went down, the dlc has the best  worst i've seen in all of fromsoft's games. best environments, best music, great exploration  unit diversity. boss mobility however.... elden beast before torrent, putrescent knight, golden hippo, bayle, .... bosses aren't fun if i spend half the fight chasing after the boss. on the other hand we got recycled content way to much , cheap aoe spam or long winded combos that make boss fights a marathon. if i could pick i'd go back to the dark souls formula of a linear game with some open routes but less quantity , more quality. elden ring is great  the dlc even more but never have i felt more conflicted with enjoyment than elden ring."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,"imo, this is the first fs that says you have to. every other game, back to demon's souls, i've felt that i could find my own work arounds. and this feels like the equivalent of if you want to play this you have to wear the dunce outfit."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,805 ah yes good old tortoleni the godslayer
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"great video, i agreed with almost everything you had to say, but i do have one other problem with the scadutree fragments that i don't think a lot of people have talked about. the scadutree fragments appear upon first glance to be an arbitrary number, and you don't really feel their impact as much compared to something like upgrading your weapon in the base game. combine both of those with some of the hardest bosses in the game, and it makes the player wonder if they're suffering from a genuine skill issue or if they just haven't levelled up their tree number to a high enough number yet. this can make some bosses incredibly hard or shockingly easy for different players, which i think is a good thing on paper, but they do so in a way that sows doubt in the player's mind, which i'm not a huge fan of personally. great video though, as usual"

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,bro at exactly 038 when i was watching the like count and the view count went up suddenly it was crazy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,i'm playing an unoptimized build is using a lions claw great sword build every time
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,if half of people call it too easy and another half calls it too hard its called....unbalanced
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,tying the dlcs level up system to a collectible you get from the most inconsistent locations was a weird choice
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,"ive done the whole mute everything spoiler free route with monster hunter wilds, cant wait to see all the monsters, armor, locales and characters for the first time as i play it. no trailers aside from the first 2"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"i think you are playing the game wrong is a bad take to have. the job of a developer is to make game even open world one in such a way that the natural tendencies of a player take them from place where they need to be for their current state to another place where they need to be for their current state. a shiny item here, a light there, a vibrant color somewhere else. breadcrumbs and paths they can follow. people are also sensitive to the way you present information to them. there is a world of difference between nerf the player and let them recover with an item and buff the dlc and let the player grow more powerful to face it with an item even if mathematically both approaches are equivalent one is perceived as punishment the other as a reward. now i do not play fromsoft games so what i wrote is based on the information provided in the video."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"810 hey, don't disrespect tortellini like that!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-24,"857 to be honest, i did not struggle with the dlc at all until the final boss. my problem with the final boss is that it has changed the souls community into people going into fextra life and being as optimized as possible instead of having fun"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-04,are you saying you're less skilled than a goldfish?! well. i rage quit at the fire giant and never came back soooo...
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"what circletoonshd, 2024"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,i can imagine miyazaki playing elden ring and losing to first boss and being like who the fuck made this game so hard?... oh shit i did
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"this is such a shallow take on this matter, the issue was not the item itself, the issue was unbalanced enemy damage, overtuned endless combos, and scummy delayed attacks, it didn't make the dlc difficult it made it tedious and unfun difficulty in souls game was majorly just a byproduct of good game design, but it became the sole premise of sote, didn't matter how enemies killed you, all it mattered to the devs is that you're dead"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,152 i will now quote circletoonshd every time i am confused with a slight hint of disagreement
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,219 is that you haku??!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-23,"the only thing i dislike about the scadu fragments is that the game doesn't tell you how many there are in an area or how many you already got, so backtracking to try and find more if you're stuck in a boss is impossible unless you wanna risk spoilers watching an youtube video."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-26,the get back in your goal cell comment had me lollllll
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"gonna say, i had almost no issue with the dlc until the final boss. that was some bullshit, and i just gave up after a while, just said fuck it and let someone else cheese it for me."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"the only thing that upset me about the dlc was the same thing that annoyed me about the basegame the game has some of the best content ive ever played, but seems borderline keen on locking me out of it. seriously, i had to roll back to a save where i had not beaten messmer yet, because i found out that entering his room not beating him, just entering his room locks you out of a whole bunch of npcquests and their rewards along with it. i didnt mind the difficulty, but i wish the game would warn me about stuff like that."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"im still not a fan of the scadutree system. i dont know how id do it differently, but idk, its very awkwardly implemented. that being said, i levelcapped myself at lvl 150 for my main playthrough of the dlc and just did whatever the hell i could find, restricting myself exclusively to the smithscript weapons for the majority of the run, and had a good time. it was a great experience, i just really didnt like the pinecones or that npc enemies still get infinite stamina and fp all these years later, fukken cheaters. i swapped off the smithscript weapons in favor of the dueling shield for radahn specifically, and slapped on the deflecting tear to try it out and.beat him in six attempts this was prenerf too. i enjoyed the smithscript weapons a ton, but the dueling shield has stolen my heart more fiercely than miquella ever could."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-21,32 whoa! didn't know you were chill like that dog
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-23,"its not that i didnt know about the fragments, its that collecting them was just not any fun for me. sote is only the second time i gave up on from content first one was ac6, so its not a huge deal. but i think its unfair how a lot of complaints are dismissed as people being dumb. im personally just kinda burned out on ers style of challenge, and the dlc is all of the things i thought were kinda mid times 12."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"as a nonfromsoft player, allow to me give you some outside perspective you're doing the fromsoft fan thing. what do i mean? when you started talking about elden ring being the easiest of fromsoft's games, your literal first example was 'almost all builds are viable'  that's not 'making the game easier', that's 'not screwing up the balance so incredibly badly that it has spawned multiple memes across multiple years in all our souls game communities.' that's not doing anything to make the game easier, that's just fromsoft actually engaging in good game design and fixing long held mistakes. it was never 'good' that you had nonviable weapons, or 'noob traps', but fromsoft fans accept that from fromsoft in a way that other communities would not, because of the 'git gud' culture that has sprung up about these games. not everything that made the prior games harder was 'challenge', a lot of the time it was 'bad game design'. i'm not saying elden ring isn't easier, but a lot of the things people assign to 'it being easier' are actually things that were just really bad about the prior games that they simply learned to accept. after all, if they ever complained about it, they just got told to 'git gud' and insulted, so they learned that it was a problem with them, not a problem with the games, even when confronted with things like a door that opened directly into a death pit that objectively added nothing of value to the gaming experience and could not reasonably be foreseen or expected before encountering it, for example. as for the fragments themselves... there's a few critical things you've just... ignored, and i'm not sure why. the first, quite simply, is that they didn't need to be there, at all. you stated that 'nobody would buy a fromsoft dlc that their late game build can destroy'  yes they would. you know they would, because that's exactly what has happened time and time again. and the thing is? that's good game design. in games like this, based on power progression, it is intentional that, if you go back to an earlier game area, you feel overpowered. it's how you, the player, can feel strong, can feel that you're actually progressing and improving, despite all the fresh bosses still clapping your cheeks in an instant when you first run into them. so taking a character that has completed the game, back to literally any part of the game... should result in you feeling at least a little overpowered, because that's how these kinds of games work. would people complain? yes, they've done it with every souls dlc, and the response they always get is 'try doing it from a fresh character or in ng, rather than taking in an overleveled character'. it's been what happens for years, and it... isn't an issue? like, there's nothing at all wrong with that sequence of events and it certainly hasn't seemed to cause any issues with selling their dlcs. so the entire 'take away the player's strength to avoid them being overpowered' thing... that was an experiment from fromsoft, to try something new... and i dare say it failed, but not solely because of this. leading me to the next issue you talked about the land of shadow stealing your power and giving it back via fragments... except they didn't. you don't regain all of your previous strength even at max scadu level, you're still going from 'i can take x hits from bosses' to 'i can take barely any hits from bosses', no matter what you do. sure, the damage comes back, but the ability to take hits while trying to learn the boss? that doesn't outside of very specific buids, and it's noticeable, especially given that that exact mechanic, taking hits and learning the bosses, is core to the entire genre that fromsoft has created. if the players got back all their power, that would certainly help, but they really don't, by comparison. and sure, you can say 'oh well it's the dlc boss's damage, not the scadu system, you actually have all your power back, they just hit really hard'. except in practice, nobody just playing the game, not searching the game's code or using a questionably accurate wiki, actually knows how much was taken away by the land of shadow or how much they're really getting back with the scadu system, so that doesn't actually help the feeling of permanently lost power that, as fromsoft players, they definitely worked very hard to earn. that's not a good feeling, and it was never going to be. another thing part of the scadu issue comes from the game they're attached to. it's no secret that the 'best' way to start a fresh playthrough of er is to run around for an hour and a half gathering seeds and tears and smithing stones, because the open world nature of the game allows you to get a ton of stuff before fighting any enemy. more, it encourages you to do so, not only because you'd get more powerful, but because a lot of these things are hidden in weird random places that you won't be visiting for any other reason than to get these items. sure, on your first playthrough you'd be there to check it out and explore  but the replayability of games like this is a major part of their value and popularity, and on your replays, this whole fetch quest nonsense at the start of the game feels bad. bad enough that people who challenge run the game for fun, or join competitions and stream the game nonstop, people who truly love this game  all hate it. and they've expressed that, very thoroughly, to the developers. so in a community that already dislikes having to pull up a wiki page and spend time hunting down a ton of tiny collectables without doing any of the fighting that makes the game fun.... they stepped foot into a new dlc that had them do the exact same thing, proving that not only did fromsoft not listen to their complaints, they didn't even learn from their mistakes and make you fight tough enemies for most of them, just keep picking them up off the ground in random places you wouldn't otherwise be. i'm not going to say the scadu fragments were some horrible awful betrayal of the community, or that whoever made the system should be fired, or any other such nonsense i've heard around the internet. and i do understand what fromsoft wanted to accomplish with them, even if i heavily disagree with the method they chose to use. but, i also can't say that, even as someone who doesn't play soulslikes, own elden ring, or even want to do either of those things.... that i don't entirely understand why people would be pissed about getting nerfed, getting told to do another long and irritating fetch quest to get unnerfed, and then finding that they still don't seem to be unnerfed. that's just not something players were ever likely to be terribly happy about, even without the context surrounding it, but there are a lot of people defending it zealously because they've bought into the git gud community and mystique surrounding fromsoftware's games. sure, it's not as bad as some of the detractors are saying it is... but the blind fanboys saying there is nothing wrong with the system are not correct either, it was a bad idea to do this in this way, in this context, and it was entirely foreseeable that it would get this reaction from the playerbase. tldr it makes sense that people aren't happy about the scadu fragments, to the point that fromsoft 100 should have seen it coming in advance. those defending it as being without flaw have fallen into the fromsoft community mystique that leads them to ignore the notable flaws in fromsoft's prior and current games as thoroughly as fromsoft's enemies have ignored walls since the demon souls days. seriously, i've no idea why after all these years fromsoft still can't make walls actually solid, it's just crazy at this point."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,"059 bro didn't want to get spoiled at all, bro wanted to experience the dlc more then i wanted to play zelda totk when i got it on my birthday, bro stayed away from all content surrounding the eldenring more than i did avoiding the playthroughs of zelda totk."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-25,"damn, i havent watched circle in a minute, what an improvement in quality, comedy, and some other words i cant fully articulate because im sleepy."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,i think there is just a part of the playerbase that doesn't play it for the exploration and just care about boss fights. so now they mad that leveling up is tied up with exploration
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,"yes, pointcrow's literal pet goldfish literally played elden ring"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,god damn the work on that handshake was smoooooth!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,genuinely the funniest guy on the internet. subbed after a single video.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,"first things first, for me this game isn't hard, i played every single fromsoft game, yes including king's field, this dlc is just a normal souls experience. but, there is a lot of problems that gets overshadowed by the difficulty complains. like the map are too big for it's content, sometimes peoplelike me do feel it's a bit empty, or the rewards are being lackluster, for example, when i exploring a beautiful scenery, i'm loving it, but after awhile i only get a handful of mushrooms and a few smithing stone 1. i mean i had to defeat mohg to get to the dlc, and this is what you offered me as reward? come on fromsoft, you can do better than that! and last, i think er community are being too defensive about criticism, nothing is perfect, this game too. we as players have to point out the shortcomings for developers to improve on, other wise is just bunch of nonsense, that doesn't help anyone at all. remember, if there's a thing that you can't criticise but only praise, that's a cult."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-23,"the final boss still required me to change my playstyle, even with all the benefits i could layer on. not all builds work for him, full stop."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,the real answer is whatever your favourite weapon scales with.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"both have solid arguments, id say its just preference of playstyle."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-06,its time to settle the debate. doesn't settle the debate.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-31,but how tf can i choose just one weapon theyre all so cool
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-09,the fact that the strength vs agility debate has literally been happening since the roman colloseum is hilarious to me.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-31,"i would definitely argue that strength is the easier for pve, the amount of staggers you get when using the giantcrusher is insane"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"i like how every build has an elemental damage they are tied with. lightning for dex, fire for str, ice for int, and holy for fth build."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,i actually perfer to do a split with a little more on strength using curved greats wordsgreat swords because you get some serious damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,"it really comes down to how fast you want to finish a fight, in multiple hits or few hits"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"strength is better mainly cuz of the increase when tow handing, but dex is way cooler imo"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,then theres that random guy who has points scaled into almost everything so you can do anything. but im mainly an intstrength build
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,bro said were gonna solve this and then proceeded to not solve it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,"quality, i can use everything and combine them together"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,quality is the best
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,you get more stance damage and hyperarmor with strength weapons though.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,"refined, my beloved, quality or death."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"as a strength user, i am certainly not biased when saying strength is better, if only for having the dragonslayer from berserk in our wheelhouse."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,that hat in the beginning. you know what olllldddd jack burton says
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"me, an int enjoyer sipping my coffee watching str vs dex hassle muggles."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"the better playstyle is the one you have the most fun with. don't let stats tell you how to play, gamers"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-26,"raising strength also raises your physical defense by a higher threshold, making you more durable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,"there are those that 2 hand a dex weapon, therefore, if you're always going to 2 hand a dex weapon, just make it strength and go strength, you do more damage, you should make sure that your ash of war is a strength type so you get more damage out of it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,if you play the game long enough... both.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,when i finally played a dex build everything felt right for my playstyle. never looked back.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-08,uchiganata my beloved
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"i was late to the elden ring party. not on purpose.... i was just waiting for it to go on sale at some point, which finally happened on new year's eve. i've been playing nonstop since. at first, i focused primarily on vigor, and strength in my build, but i then began to notice that dexterity was strengthening my onehanded weaponry considerably more than strength, so i've been focusing more on updating that in recent weeks. i also need to boost my endurance in order to wear the armor i want, while also being able to weld any weapon i want. right now, i just dramatically upgraded ghiza's wheel, but in order for me to use it, i would have to traverse the game buttnaked. see what i'm saying. i often use both the silver and gold scarab talismans, but if i have the opportunity, i also attempt to increase arcane statistics, with the hopes of getting hard to collect weapon and armor drops. even if i have no plans to use most of them, i try to collect as much as i can just for the simple sake of owning it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,"in ng47, str and dex do around similar dmg for some reason, and str is much slower and stamina consuming, which is almost a death sentence. irs always safer going dex in higher games, but both are decent in ng. nothing beats spells and incants though."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,when you accidentally put one point into dex moonlight by kali uchis starts playing
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-01,time to settle the... settles nothing and vaguely describes
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-21,i just got into elden ring and i love zweihanders. when i found out i could get one i had im left and im right playing in my head
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,while me with 60 int and glintstone socries yawning away while i cast spells
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,"shall i turn your runes into strength? well i'm not here to turn 'em into dex, that's for fuckin sure"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-01,"dex also tends to have weapons that are faster, and to make up for a lack of two handed bonus it tends to have better scaling. damage wise, dex builds usually have better burst damage but its balanced by the lack of poise damage and hyperarmor."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-17,i've been trying str arc build recently and i'm in love. great sword with bleed affinity is op af
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,not that there is a correct answer but i love that you didnt even try to answer your own question...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,"no buffs and no physick is how i played the game always, only until mohg just for the nihil attack and i currently still play like that"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-29,does dex buff critical hits like in bloodborne? just remembered its skill in bb
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"it seems like whenever i start a ng wanting to be strength i always find cool dex weapons, so i can never make up my mind"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,just 99 both of them.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-19,"its funny to look back at my experiences with dark souls into elden ring and how id find a weaponplaystyle and just stick with it for the whole game and just leave it at that for ds13. now, im playing elden ring for the first time and its so long that ive actually gone through a few weapons, armors and playstyles with plenty of game left."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-05,strength has the big fat balls
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-22,"the best one is whichever weapon type you want to use most. i like katanas and colossal and normal greatswords so i generally need both stats plus arcane for that bleed boost. however i love the blackflame incantations so i tend to add faith to my build, and i grab that blackflame seal as soon as possible."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,incorrect. it's int. glintstone stars go ding pew pew pew.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,"you can also scale spells with strength and faith together. while it won't reach the same sheer numbers as a pure faith or pure strength build, it will give you many powerful options. all the best buffs, pocket sand, the rock, all manners of fire and lightning, and a big old clobbering device."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,funny thing is that some bosses its easier to deal with dex katanas and some with strength for example two halberds.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,dex also is often used side by side with status effects since its faster movesets allow better buildup.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-10,dex based weapons are always the coolest with best move sets
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,"another factor would be poise damage and causing enemies to flinch which can interrupt an attack or prevent them from attacking outright, and stat effects. hitting multiple times and building up status effects happens faster with dex weapons but preventing your enemy from attacking is massive"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,well thanks for clearing that up
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"don't forget that for fire infusions, the fire damage also scales with strength, just like how lightning things scale with dexterity. though, there's also flame art, which scales with faith, but like for anything that's associated with the redmanes flaming strike, flame of the redmanes, etc., the fire damage scales exclusively with strength."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,this realy helped me
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,"oh, all of the invisible variables that most of us are searching for this answer upon not here lol"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,i recently did a rellana playthrough balancing str dex fai and int and wow it was so damn fun
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,huh. i actually didnt know that fire or lightning damage thing. dope
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,"also, if you're powerstancing or onehanding sword and board an such, the twohand bonus doesn't rly matter."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,"im doing my str run now, and something really good about strenght weapons is that they deal a lot of poise damage and stuns quite nicely compared with dex weapons, so definetely the way to go for pve"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,im on my first playthrough mostly just using faith and a sacred uchigatana and having a blast lol.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,"strength weapons also usually deal a lot more stance damage and against bosses, that's usually king"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-09,my first playthrough was almost all dexterity with enough faith for some weapons. the strength run was much easier but could've been because i already knew what was going on. definitely felt easier
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,"my first play through was a hybrid of faith, dex and strength."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-17,"also blood buildup, one of the strongest dmg you can apply works best with dex"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"i think you should get an extra 50 dex if you hold a weapon in one hand with nothing in your other hand. same limitation as twohanding in that you don't have a space to use another weapon or shield, but makes more sense than giving you extra dex for twohanding."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,"i usually go strength but decided to try a dexparry build and it's been fun but a lot more challenging. it did finally solo rellana with a buckler and lightning misericorde, though after five hours of attempts and it'll probably take another five hours to do again because holy shit her second phase."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,elden ring players when you want to slice instead of bonk
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-15,coming back to eldenring after playing ds1again makes me appreciate strength weapon changes.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-02,i love both playstyles
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-16,"which one is better? the answer is this, which ever you are using for your build."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-05,i have so many stats at 30 because i needed faith for lightning arcane for bleed i didn't know fire scales with strength intelligence and mind i'm glad i found this out i respeced my charactor and hated it immediatly
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,"strictly saying, strength has the most practical quirks like physical damage absorption and twohanding buff. plus you can infuse any weapon with strength yes you can even bruteforce a strength katana with little to no downsides. so the real question is if you really want somber dex weapons or lightning damage or if you just like having fun, which is always reasonable"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,i use whatever my favorite weapon asks of me in my case it's the giant crusher
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-09,strength also raises your defense faster. something i wish i knew a lot sooner.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-31,"but a good part is that most dexterity weapons give a lot of dps, and this helps to cause bleeding"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-22,"call me a madman, call me crazy, but why not both? quality builds work really great, too great actually"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,"this all of course only matters until rl175 or so, where then youre better off having both on a quality buildor of course one of the two, plus faitharcaneint"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-14,as a quality banished knight great sword user my answer was both lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,"i have three characters for pvp rl125 pure str, rl150 pure dex, rl 200 strint. i shuffle through them during a pvp sitting. oh i also have a level 60 10 pure str build for low level invasion, speaking of which, the 50 buff while 2h has been sweet in lower level."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-05,i have a crazy hybrid character on the strength and intellect side with good dexterity right now using moon veil and ore sword both upgraded that both have scaling with magic with that charm that increases magic damage...plan in making pvp vids on my build
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,chad quality build has entered the room
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-17,"stance damage is a factor i didn't see mentioned here. the weapons that do higher stance damage tend to be str scaling weapons. continuously breaking a boss' stance is huge, and str builds tend to make it look easy. a higher str stat also allows for the usage of certain greatshields that can help trivialize various bosses. if you haven't used a greatshield, try it out with a str scaling greatspear or heavy thrusting sword and see what i mean. some may mention that status builds are the best, so dex weapons should also be seen as the best for being able to quickly apply status, but there's two issues with that 1. bleedpoison builds care more about arc than any other stat, and you're often fine with just hitting the str and dex stat requirements on the weapons you're using. 2. the bloodfiend's arm and spinning gravity thrust on a bleed infused colossal are also insane bleed options, and these are str weapons."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-05,its simple if you 2 hand pick strength fire affinity if you power stance or 1 hand for some other reason lighting will out perform fire affinity so go lightning affinity
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,the one that lets ya carry the biggest shields
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-28,as dex and str fifht each other the moon in the background gets close and closer. and kaboom!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-05,"having done it, if you want a pure physical dmg build, once you have the levels for it, do a quality build. i'm level like 280 and have 80s in both strength and dex, 60 vigor, and the rest into fp, stamina and a some into faith for bestial vitality. for pure physical, it absolutely wrecks house. for best results use weapons with at least double b scaling after putting on the quality effect or its not really worth it"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,me play elden ring me hit everything with bonk theres something just so hilarious wielding a weapon thats longer than the tarnishes torso lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-15,i'm having so much fun using a dex arcane elenas poleblade build.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-09,"deciding which is better for pvp also comes down to weapon variety and no, infusing the weapon with dex instead of str or viceversa loses out on a lot of damage so that's not worth it, builds at high levels of play are usually a mix and match of different weapons that you change on the fly and spells don't really have that big of an impact except for very specific cases. overall they're both good for pvp but strength probably takes the cake simply because of how many pvpviable weapons that category has. i'm not too familiar with dlc weapons so this might've changed though, i know some new weapons are obscenely broken like the claws of night and those scale better in dex."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,"both, i build both and go quality weapon, always have, don't care if it's good or bad, i like the build and have been using similar builds since demons souls."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-24,as for myself i use a dextint build with a little of faith and eso for draconic incant
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-21,"dancing sword of ranah, i have come to love that weapon, unending dance aow more like the dance of death is what i call it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,"that obligatory hurr durr, gotta appease both the masses bit at the end"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-30,strbleed with pickaxe in each hand is my go to easy mode.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,me with 60 dex and 60 strenght i might be the chosen one
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-11,i always choose dex because of the variety. plus i love my dexfaith and dexint builds
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-17,"i have a mostly str build and i switch between 3 weapons depending on the ennemy bloodhound fang, greatsword and giant crusher"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"strength in pvp can use a great variety of weapons very efficiently because of the two handed buff, for rl125 it's very good"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,"dex was the most fun in my opinion, you had access to the weapons with some of the coolest weapon arts in the game, especially when the dlc came out. i am sad we never got a holy katana though"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,"big strength weapons need a high investment in endurance, too. dex rarely has that need."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,"strength builds are almost always just jump attacks. with dex, you can play with it a little bit and utilize dodging and different ashes of war, my favorite being quickstep on the hook claws. strength builds are the only build i recomend new players since it usually requires less thinking. when it comes to your armor, wear heavy and just poise through every enemy attack. for dex builds, i always have a lower poise and armor rating since i don't wear the arsenal charm or level up endurance to tolerate the higher weighted armor pieces of the knights."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,wish i knew this before being reborn
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-06,"so, i've been two handing my uchikatana for no reason this whole time!? good thing i started duel welding"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,the whole ansbach set provides about a 16 damage increase

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-07,pretty sure the white mask would work better there. it gives 10 boost itself
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-10,i love you. i'm doing the 3rd run to platinum this sheet and i already have a bleed build. this max it just noice
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-22,"instead of rakshasa greaves, run the unaltered version of banished knight chestpiece and ansbach's helm, gauntlets and boots. that gives you 51 poise without bullgoat tali  it looks nice."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,i am loving mohgs weapon and talisman right now. i can't believe what it does.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,"nice build! i would personally swap out bull goat for m's prosthesis and add heavier armor, i think that will do more damage with the add'l repeated strikes buff and also more defense from the armor. could be wrong but that's what i'd go with"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,also theres the white mask that gives a 10 boost and stacks with lords of bloods exultation
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,blood tax in a great katana is very good with this build too

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,"official build review damage a defense d accessibility d versatility c fashion b summary although this build has good damage, there are alternatives that are objectively stronger because they have better physical damage, same or better range, and comparable aow while only requiring small stat reallocations e.g., nagakiba, gkat. fashion is practical for damage albeit unoriginal and defenses are terrible. built is not versatile  it is an aow mash machine. importantly, most of the weapons and armor are not early game accessible unless duped, making gkat and nagakiba much better weapons to build around. final evaluation build is mid"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,can you please do a base game only insane bleed build
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,i did this but with the occult great katana and worked good with wild strikes
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-15,"waste of a talisman on bull goat in my opinion, i like nagakiba with occult infusion with high arcane"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,gerhman has the best ost
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"this build is good but we can make it better. 10 rob, ritual sword or red feathered if you want to nohit and max out damage, lob exultation, rws insignia, shard of alexander. for buffs the physic setup in here is nice, although for incantsbuffs i would change golden vow for commander standard ash of war and stack it using howl of shibriri. this combo gives a 40 damage increase with damage negation at 0 so the only disadvantage you get is the duration. one thing you could do if you enter dlc early is get the physic tear that increases your damage by 20 but also takes 1 hp a second so to counter this use the healing incant i forgot the name, i think blessing of the erdtree? and if using this you can swap out ritual sword for two handed sword talisman. if you want to increase damage even further via buff stacking swap the helm for black dumpling and madness talisman for 3540 extra damage increase i dont remember the damage increase kor exultation  mushroom crown for another 3540 and finally varres white mask and congratulations youre 2 shotting 90 of the bosses in the game. 5 is 1 shot the other 5 is probably 34 shot. now, if you want a short build that takes maybe an hour at most to get use 1 reduvia dagger 10 dont dual weild, only using 1 is genuinely better, blue dancer charm, ritual sword, lob exultation, rotten wing sword insignia, i forgot what i put for the 4th, varres white mask, golden vow incantcommander standard ash, howl of shibririflame grant me, with dexknot crystal tear, thorny cracked tear as the physic. now youre 4 shotting bosses with an ash of war at most keep in mind to get the most damage with this weapon you need to hit the boss with the blade and the ash to get the most damage. it should total out to about 4k damage per ash and a guaranteed bleed proc with 2 casts if done correctly. with this build it looked like all of the phantom bosses were getting bleed damage even though they werent. you can beat every boss in the game going slowly in about 9 hours maximum excluding dlc havent tested yet but can make it stronger swapping ritual sword with 2 handed tali. for the 4th if you cant think of something better you can just put 2 handed sword on it with dlc access. if not the prior setup works."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-13,"you can make this build so much better with just one weapon , the sword lance commander gaius gives you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-13,"i'm using the dancers set, nagakiba with sword dance with all the talismans except millicents prosthesis instead of the bullgoats talisman"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,i like starting as confesor with broadsword and head down the coast and buy the other broadsword in the game. one frost one bleed and they do massive damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,this is suboptimal is so many ways
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,"better off running eleonora poleblade with this, or if you want to run the str version either dual beast cleaver, or charged attacks with blood arm"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-31,or replace bull goat with the millicent prosthesis if you're good at evading
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,this can get even better if you power stance with the nagakiva in the other hand and use seppuku
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-03,"you wouldn't have to use the goat talisman if you just increased your endurance, so get rid of that and just use the prosthesis talisman instead it will provide you with better damage"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-25,rivers of blood is a weapon in elden ring
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,white mask white rakshasa set would be a better bleed armour set
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,i'd replace the helmet with white mask purely cause the damage boost
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-21,get rid of all the trash and use rob with cold uchi. the fire damage on rob resets frost proc and by removing your limit to weapon arts youll do better in fights overall because you can have higher damage uptime instead of waiting for a 10 second opening to use entire aow and actually make use of your short term buffs
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-06,loretas poleblade is the better choise because is has more bleed build up and more poise damage and a stronger ash of war
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,or just use the whole rakshasa set for poise and use milicents prosthesis instead of bullgoat talisman.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-12,me with 136 poise and still light rolling bc i use the night claws. i brought my endurance up to 75 at one point so i could carry the big hammer and still medium roll
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,id say replace bullgoat tali with flame scorpion charm
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-10,fourcoregamer is stealin your vids man
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,ansbach my beloved
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-05,nearly finish the game to be op af
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,"by the point you have all that, you already finished th game 4 times"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"instead of bullgoat's, use fire scorpion, thank me later."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-25,enemies that dont bleed
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"no disrespect guy, but youre mildly incorrect... due to rob dealing fire damage, fgms actually gives a 30 buff due to buffing both aspects of the damage. for those who don't know, rob has a 6040 damage ratio spread between physical and fire, and fgms gives 15 to physical and 15 to fire damage. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. keep up the good content, and everyone subscribe!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"with 60 arcane, with onre more inteligence maybe moonveil could be used in the build!!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"good ng build, maby swap rob with eleonora or something that was not nerfed to the ground"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,wouldn't you want the white mask
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-29,"el set de ansbach aumenta el dao solo de las aow, eso solo para aclarar, ademas el talisman de tauro cabra no sirve de nada en una build como est, no solo porque con ese set de armadura sigue siendo muy poco aplomo, tambien porque la mayora de jefes siempre te van a hacer stagger al menos que lleves armaduras mas pesadas, y la lgrima de romper postura solo hace dao extra a la propia postura, no al dao en general y con un arma como rob no es eficiente, por todo lo demas, esta build esta bastante bien optimizada"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-09,another build you forgot that is really good in elden ring the entire map
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-29,i dont know builds i just know bonk
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,i cant be the only one saying that white mask is missing right?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-23,psssst. it's an open secret that early games weapons are always among the strongest in fromsoft games.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-11,could be better replacing maybe i dont really know tho ansbachs mask with varre's mask and bullgoat talisman for the millicents prosthesis tho you'd need to do her quest 2 times also idk if it stacks up but you can also go for howl of shabriri and the bloodboil aromatic
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-01,"the moment i heard rivers of blood, i was turned off"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,bloodfiend arm outdamages this whole set solo
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-20,unless the boss can't bleed
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-27,reavers of blood in big 24
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-05,omg 51 poise wataheeeeeeeeeeeeell damn son 51 poise omg what a number niiiiiiiiiii
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-25,why not the white mask?
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"youre telling me to put 17 lvls into faith just for these two buffs when golden vow is an item found in the dlc? thats wild i think ill keep those 17 lvls in something else and just use my golden vow items also ganna swap that bull goats for melenias prosthesis, swap for white mask and ansbach legs"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-08,i personally would use ritual sword instead of bullgoat. why have extra poise if youre not gonna get hit
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-30,defenses shit damage brrrrrrr
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-21,"wouldn't the boost be higher if you used howl of shabriri instead of flame grant me strength?obviously you add the senescent talisman,the crazy hand and the helmet that boosts you when madness activates, sorry i don't remember the english name"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,60 dex 60 arcane imma do this after i beat the game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-20,aight so pretty sure this doesnt really add up to 240 extra damage seeing as some of the buffs are only applied to specific damage types rather than in general. plus rob got nerfed clean into the ground so i doubt this is all that good
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,can you use the fire scorpion charm instead if the bull goat talisman? i know that the rivers of blood deals at least a little bit of fire damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,in theory this would be a good build. in reality its not gonna give you a 240 damage increase. the damage in the game is multiplicative not additive. so instead of adding 15 damage to a 20 damage to get 35. youre only adding the 15 to the remaining 80 of damage you didnt do with the  15
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,"bro said top tier bleed damage right after max out rivers of blood. sir, the nerfs weren't your fault, you need to let its memory die."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,"unless if my game is broken and yours isnt, i remember testing and seeing that rotten winged sword insignia doesnt stack with thorny cracked tear. but i could be wrong, are you sure you tested it?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-27,too bad rivers of cheese doesn't have highest bleed rating.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-02,what about white mask??
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,"so you say, just get overlevled as hell and game is ez? no sht d"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,rivers of what?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-06,why not 3 piece ansbach and white mask? why don't people do that?
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,tried it at max level everything and my playstation five lost power
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,"i dont have he dlc and killed varre, what are some substitutions to the armor?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-31,if your good at the game put on milicents prostecis and put on the full ansbac set
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-23,"rivers of blood is nerfed, instead add a dual slash ash of war with bleed affinity to the scavengers curved sword for a 104 bleed prog. dual wield scavengers curved sword and use varres mask and the claw talisman, you can get up to 6x hits pr jump attack"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-08,golden cow is like 12.5 upgrade u should use commanders standard for 20
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-09,naw i never use boosted spell and stuff i just use 2 reduvias to absolutely destroy messmer. my name is let me solo him. i am in school rn but ill be back on with my gold summon sign down ready to help people kill messmer at 445 nst
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-03,you know this requires going through the entire dlc main quest line right?
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-16,guys i accidentally killed millicent while doing her quest what should i do i want the talismans
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-28,"no works in ng8 i have 99 vigor, 99 arcane, 99 dex , 40 strgh, 40 mind, 60 in others. learn parry and rest."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,i refuse to utilize rob
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,"power stance rotten axe is more deadly to use 80 str 80 arcane 4060 vigor 4050odd stamina points, some mana points and as many int and faith points as needed, we wear the mushrom cown as a headdress and the rest of the set we wear the rakasha set, we wear the lord blood and poison talisman as talisman, we wear the claw talisman and the optional incantion in the last talimasnda as golden wow and optional incantion and spells, you can use golden wow and optional incantion and spells, we choose craigblade ash oof waru and bleedin infission to one of the rotten axes, and we choose poison mist to the other and the infission will be bleed again, and every boss can be passed very easily when used with mimicry."
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-21,dont use rivers just use nagakiba with double slash it gets better damage and bleed
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-01,"ansbach x3  11 aow dmg rakshasa x1  2 overall dmg shard of alexander  15 aow damage rotten sword  13 overall dmg lob exultation  20 overall dmg thorny cracked  20 charged r2 attack dmg flame shrouding  10 fire dmg vow  grant  35 overall dmg  20 fire dmg alright. so a lot doesn't line up. thorny cracked is useless. rivers of blood has 186 physical and 186 fire damage.  overall damage as in physical weapon damage. the current overall damage with this setup is 70 or 316 physical.  fire damage amounts to 30 or 241 total fire damage. you have 26 extra aow damage. 398 physical  313 fire on mv 100. corpse piler has 6 slashes. 3 being mv 75, 3 being mv 100 for a total of 2090 physical, 1643 fire. at 99 arcane, rivers of blood has 79 hemorrhage buildup. ousa tells us to go with 60 arcane, so i'll be generous and say that it also has 60 hemorrhage at that point. the status mv of the 6 slashes in rising order are 40, 40, 40, 50, 60, 100, totaling 198 hemorrhage buildup not even enough to bleed most bosses unless you use 35 full combos granted some bosses, like margit, start with their bleed gauge half full once you enter their arena. assuming the boss has 0 resistance in slash and fire damage, you are doing approximately 3733 damage, sometimes more depending on if there are any decimals, and inflicting 198 bleed buildup with one whole 6hit combo. to pull this off in the first place, you will already be in lateend game on new game bosses have high resistances and huge health pools. let's take godskin duo as an example the next fight after fire giant. apostle has 6668hp, 10 resistance to slash, and 40 resistance to fire. one full aow deals 2298 physical and 986 fire for a total of 3284 damage. you need to apply 251 hemorrhage to proc one blood loss, meaning that somewhere in the second aow combo you will kill apostle. noble has the same stats, other than his 8000 hp. you will also kill noble within 2 aow combos, and if not, one or two r1s will do it. there are many ways to increase the damage of this, this is very unoptimised, but it goes to show just how good this weapon still is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,is this build good for dlc radahn?
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-19,why not the bloodsucking cracked tear?
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,using strictly bleed and status effect weapons legit spoils you and makes you suck ass without that surprise surprise 2000 damage every now and again. when the fight keeps on going for too long you end up dying because you arent used to it anymore lol not that it matters just drop it for awhile and get good again and youll be fine
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-12,what about if im lvl 286 because i am

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"feel like they're giving us a glance at what's they are experimenting with movement and combat option, before implement them into their next title with nightreign."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,that sekirodeflection showcase has already sold me on the game.

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-14,"people are kind of split on this and i get both sides, but honestly im excited to see how this plays out. if treated right this could be something really special. although we gotta be very careful this doesnt become a beginning of the end for this franchise. i dont think itll go that far, but we have seen companies destroy themselves."

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"knight artorias, i hope to see you soon."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-23,"from what i've noticed, elden ring is basically a test of new ideas and approaches to older ones. like how the first one is open world and leans more into summons. while this may be the most drastic change, we have to keep in mind that sekiro was in the same boat. might even be why they made elden ring to begin with. to branch out more."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,only 5 seconds of new footage?  dlc confirmed?  4 months till launch?  my body? ready!

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,miyazaki saw all the mods and told his devs tony stark was able to build that in a cave! with a box full of scraps. dude foreal brings anime fights to game along with eldritch horrors

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,037 sekiro reference
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"lets go!!! im super hyped for this! but i hope, there is some new sleep stuff..."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-13,"so, you can play alone or with two more, but not in pairs? in 2025? that's wild"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,omg so fast
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,its more of a mode than a game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,the suffering has a countdown
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,we've already seen this gameplay...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,love the trumpets in the music 3

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"pre ordered, see you soon!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,you can tell this isn't directed by miyazaki because there's no feet in the trailer
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,this is gonna be so hype
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"mod makers, make a mod so it's possible to do 2 players coop and my life is yours!"

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"tarnished one aspiring to play nightreign. if you've known sin, if you grieve for this world. then, yield the path towards nightreign."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,oh i cannot wait
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,"it looks good but i wouldn't get my hope highs people but if you're that much of a blind fanboy then i guess you'll like it, er wasn't that great i'd say but it's still better than whatever this is."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,so excited for this!

RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,days off will be requested come may
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-21,"man, even the trailer feels soullessly slapped together"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,so ready for the beta
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,seems like a cash grab d
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,this is dope! i love how they changed the game dynamics!!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-12,this is just a reused trailer with the scenes moved around and a different track.. this was just lazy in terms of a new trailer.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-22,"i accidentally killed him like this on my first play through, i was so confused and a little terrified because i thought a bigger boss had killed him and was coming for me"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,flying enemies dying from fall damage is always funny
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-18,"perfect for jumpstarting a new playthrough. pop the golden fowl foot when greylls in the tpose and if youve already set it to night, you have enough time to ride to  cheese night cav and get the gold boost from the same golden fowl foot"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-06,"dying by memes, the worst fate in this game"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,"it took me a few times, but when i did do this, he glitched for me and fell off cliff."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-08,do it on the left upper part of the tree or else youll die from his fire it is also easier to go out when he does the flying breath attack
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-06,"i havent crossed that bridge in forever, so i forgot that he even existed. im on ng17"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,imagine being the dragon. tiny tarnished somehow jedi mind tricks you and the universe into dying by falling
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-30,funny i never heard what the word agro till i started playing and watching videos about this game.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,mine just fell off the bridge while flying animation and died haha
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,heh this accidentally happened to my brother on his first playthrough. we just started laughing so hard when he fell and died instantly
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,ancestral follower spirit ashes will pump arrows into it outside of it's aggro range until it dies. easy cheese.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,he just kept using his fire breath and never did the flying sttack
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,january 2025  still works
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,"march 2025  still works, if he keeps on shooting fire, try again and try to get him a bit closer to the tree this time"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,this weird dragon dies when i tried crossing the vridge from the other side first. . .
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-11,you can do it on any of the high places around the bridge.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-05,"whenever i start up a new file i just run over to a bleed weapon, wild strikes, and go cheese the 2 giant dragons and the nightrider, so ill definitely be using this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-27,why is it always the bridge enemies
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,i wish i knew this.i was on twitch dying my ass off trying to kill him until i finally did lmfao. this is so funny imma try it on a new play through lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,this dragon was a piece of came compared to that deathbird just up the trail outside guranks bachelor pad
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,i fought him at lvl 1 not knowing what i was doing d
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-07,"it happened to me as well i was ok, it was almost dead anyway"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,i just ran for my life. like i normally did on elden ring.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,welcome back ceaseless discharge
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-02,"he disappeared when i was fighting him. i was kicking his butt then bam, gone. he hasnt come back yet"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-08,hell i killed him normally but i used the tree for a different tactic  the oh shit here comes fire get behind this damn tree tactic.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-22,smart work
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,"i am playing a new run, i need to try this"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-22,"only normal dragons who give a decent challenge imo are ekzykes or borealis. all the others arent too strong, and even those two just take a little patience to avoid their breath or stomp attacks."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-07,"just got 80,000 runes this way"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,this is more of a hassle than to just fight him straight on.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,whats funny is i just spent like two hours trying to beat him at low lvl
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-23,occured to me first run
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-31,mine dove off the side several times
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-26,"first time i ran past him and he got stuck on the air and then died i was like dude, your wings... use them. also thanks for the runes i wasn't planning on killing you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,thank you
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-18,i tried luring him from the other bridge and couldn't beat him for the longest time. but this tpose came by accident.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-16,i accidentally did this i was so confused
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,i think i did it wrong because instead of him going over the spot he just basically hovered right above the tree and i was like what the f and then he used a fire blast and then he killed me so making second attempts hopefully better than the first lmao
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-07,still works as of 3625
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-30,idk how i killed by jumping the same moment he landed on me after flying up
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-13,i accidentally did this on the tree on the other side
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,easiest dragon in the game after the one who just lays there from fatness
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-24,i fought him for a long time and after learning his moves i managed to deal at least 70 of his hp and then he falls and die.. i was kinda disappointed.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,thank u bro 80k runes tysm bro
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-26,why would you do that to george the friendly dragon
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,that seems like a lot more effort than just r1'ing his feet like usual  dragons are some of the easiest big enemies in the game
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-08,this got patched. he now drops down to the cliff under the tree and will fly back in the air and then land on the cliff over the sit of grace by the bridge
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-13,nice tip...but some of these glitches are harder to trigger than they may seem in the expert video
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,when i tried to fight him legit i hit him once he hit me almost kills me and i run to the tree to heal and he did the flying thing so i ran back to the bridge and he just got stuck i was so confused when he just died
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-02,march 2nd 2025  still works
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-28,fucking dragon sits there and has aim not shooting fire at me while i try the cheese then when he jumps he lands on the bridge
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-05,chads who beat this dragon no exploits
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-20,"anytime i try these, they never work"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,"or.... hear me out.... you just beat the boss the normal way, it's not even a tough fight"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-14,this region in caelid is insane because of 100k runes that we can get within the first hour of the game lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,no way in subscribeing it worked
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-19,classic from jank
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-20,"that's just a falling animation, a tpose is a base pose used for rigging humanoid models, not something a plebeian would know."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-27,"this happened to me by accident when i was new and low level, i'll admit i was stoked for the runes, came back new game plus and fought him properly"
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-12,emotional damage
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-04,i got annihilated
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-01,i beat it by making it fall off the bridge.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-17,die from memes
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-26,he keeps using his fire breath and never jumps im going to lose my shits
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,i mean he is flyind dragon greyll but not the landing deagon greyll
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-03,he just keeps shooting fire nothing else
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-06,help me he started spamming flame
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-11,"that's actually not beating the dragon, that's called cheesing the dragon. you don't get credit where credit isn't due."
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-28,i just cheesed him with arrows
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-09,i cant get it to work
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-04-11,omfg thank you for this. trying to kill this thing at level 1 for a dragon heart was seriously annoying. this made it so much easier.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-16,menah that lame me in 20minsdamn bro thanks
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-23,"its a glitch? i just killed him whith poison arrows. its pretty easy, shoot, run, repeat until its dead."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-02-16,or just fight him. he's pretty easy
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-05,real gigachads beat him with skill and honor
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-12,"jan 12, 2025. does not work for me. bastard keeps breathing fire, and even when i am behind cover, he always hits me with a ricochet."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-27,y not just beat him the old fashion way...by enjoying the losses .. makes you a better player
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-17,why did i think i was i watching skyrim for a second

RPG,Elden Ring,2023-10-07,i just put on my starfist and punch him in the face a few times probably less effective but definitely took less time
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-25,doesnt work
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-17,why though. youre not learning to be skilful with your weapon
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-09,why wouldn't you want to just fight the scary dragon? what's wrong with you man somebody's not making it to valhalla.
RPG,Elden Ring,2023-09-10,so exploiting a bug

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,i was waiting for your video!! love your series!!!
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-10,the reason they were coming to you i believe has something to do with summon distance to player. like a tethering distance. or thrall distance like conan exiles. there maybe a threshold for how far they can be to act autonomously.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-07-30,here to prove i was watching before 50k subs
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,everyone clap for sellen and the others for finding out the soft caps by coincidence.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"i love that you find it on a body at the bottom of a platforming fall. a subtle hint that the thing is nearly completely useless. good going, from."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"did you know that in cut content, the cat talisman talks about how radahn had a cat?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,caramel apprentice... ...blushes...
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"feels like a relic from a point in the development where fall damage was less forgiving. i feel like they doubled the grace period for fall damage from dark souls, but after testing it probably had too much chip damage for an open world game where you could take fall damage over time and would discourage exploration."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"best new thing i've learned recently, has been? if you wear even just one piece of the briar set, you will not break pots, barrels, tables, boxes et cetera by jumping or backstepping into them. this helps platforming tremendously!!"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,we need more sellen
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"so, there's two other ways to ensure that you don't die to fall damage. the first and simplest way is to toss a prism stone off the ledge first. it makes a different sound if the fall is lethal. the second is to use any ash of war that moves you forward for example, waterfowl dance. if you use the ash and the drop is lethal, you won't go past the edge. if you do go over the side and fall, the landing is almost certainly survivable."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"there is one spot in volcano manor if you are entering from the raya lucaria path you can jump on a corner that almost kills you, using the talisman lets you save a flask that you are gonna need because of the lava walk untill anywhere"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i'm gonna wear my kitty ring if i damn well please
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"sellen completely took over roderika's job. in a few episodes, she'll be calling us titanite slabs"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"as others have said, elden ring provides a helpful trick to judge if a fall is lethal or not. take a rainbow stone easily craftable with a ruin fragment then toss it off the edge. if the fall is lethal the stone will shatter. if the stone lands intact, then you may live to tell the tale if you jump down. be careful though... there are a few places where a rainbow stone does not shatter but the fall is still lethal. for example, deep water that your character can't swim will not trigger the shattering sound."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,thank you sellen! i actually didnt know this was in the game and the reassurance i get from being called an apprentice instead of a slur every day is the only reason i learn anything in elden ring!
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,we absolutely need it so we could get to know radahns lore
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,miyazaki just wanted to try and give the player something nice
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,there's a cat talisman in elden ring? never knew that
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,as a player whos just now experiencing elden ring  on my second playthrough though  i appreciate the fact youre still posting new content. that dex fact is crazy !
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"the ds3 version was useful in places like the cathedral of the deep during invasions, you could bait people into jumping after you as it seemed like you took no damage from the fall, they'd take significant damage and you could turn and finish them off."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"i do like the talisman, mostly because it's easy to get right before taking the volcanic manor warp with the abductor in caria manor. it makes the jump down to the main area and the lava a lot safer. but that's genuinely the only use i have for it. but since the cat talisman is right at the abductor, it feels like a perfect use for the talisman."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,the reason it was so useful in some other games is because of additional mechanics that lead to it not being survivable without the talisman. ds3 used your max embered health to determine damage meaning some lethal drops would no longer be so with the talisman. ds2 had weight and vigor being mechanics toward fall damage taken so it made sense there as well
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"i use the cat talisman in the leyendel sewers when dropping down on the pipes to get into the lobster pit. the only other location i can think of is in the caelid divine tower, if you are doing the skip, but it doesnt even matter there because you end up at a grace anyways."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,yes! the difference between starting fall damage and instdeath being 15th of the lethal length makes the damage window so small you don't really get a grasp on which falls will start to hurt or straightup kill you. as demonstrated in the video the difference can be one ledge and isn't that perceivable from up high.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"if you can keep a pretty strong mental note of where the locations in the game are where a fall would result in nonlethal damage, i would say this talisman has use in the fact that it can be immediately swapped on as opposed to the soft cotton or the spell, both requiring a moment of slowdown in order to be applied. if you're say in an invasion setting and require a quick getaway that can actually punish the host or any of their teammates that dare pursue you further and you know a location like this is nearby, hot swapping the cat talisman on and taking the plunge could provide you that edge needed to either get away as they refuse to jump themselves, or gjve you a followup combat advantage by them taking the damage themselves if they are not prepared for such a situation as you are. is it a niche and rarely applied set of circumstances to even give this thing credit for? sure, but i wouldn't go as far as to say it's useless. i will admit though, it would be weirdly cool if fall damage could fall no pun intended somewhere between what it is in this game and, say, dark souls 1. that to me would be a nice decent balance to make strategies like this feel just a bit more viable again like they used to be."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"i like the idea of sorceress sellen being the voiced counterpart to zullie, the witch."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"you can get this talisman in the virgin telporter to volcano manor. to get to volcano manor you have to drop down the ledge, which takes a lot of fall damage. this talisman is for that, so you can stay in the lava for a little bit longer if you don't have enough vigor"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,its good for the start of a run if your going to gelmir through the abductor at the bottom of ria lucaria were youll find the talisman itll save you from taking to much damage cause youll need the health to survive the lava after dropping to get to the lower part of volcano manor
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"i still remember my happines the first time i found that talisman, because the equivalent of that item in ds3 was pretty good. just to feel disappointed later on because i wasn't even able to tell the difference it made to have it equipped."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,when i first saw this item i read the description wrong so i was like negates fall damage? wow thats op and jumped off a cliff
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"there is one place i always use, it would be in the lyndell sewers. where the pipes dont go more down and its a long drop to the two oversized lobsters to get through the crack in the catacombs and collect mohgs seal. i would use it to take less damage when jumping off the pipe just to be ready to face or even run away from the oversized dinners."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,all i've found for it is a jump skip you can do early on to skip the twin virgins in volcano manor.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,i need to find this artist's gallery because i love how they present the characters.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,extremely useful for volcano manor if you use it to get down the lava falls you can make it to godskin noble
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"that dex feature existed in ds3 for sure, but i forget if it goes further back."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,they shouldve implemented fall damage into the level design like with the big drop in irithyll in dark souls 3. the cat ring was super useful in that area.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"that ring was so useful in ds3 invasions, people thought it was safe to chase and got their ankles broken"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"you use it next to where you find it, you teleport to volcano manor and go the silly route by jumping into lava."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"you can also check by dropping a rainbow stone off a ledge. breaks  death, doesnt  youll live"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,"there is an item in the town outside volcano manor that you need this talisman to get, soft cotton will not mitigate the fall danage enough though beyond that it is fairly useless. this pointlessness is nodded to in how its found, on a dead body who presumable died after a very long fall."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"i honestly forgot this thing existed. i used it once in the early days cause i thought no more fall damge. i was wrong, and i never thought about it again."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,i thought playing souls games for 5 straight years made me feel no emotions but hearing you say my little caramel apprentice made me blush
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,something is telling me that there was a point in development where the damage distance was more scaled out over the current system where it basically doesn't hurt at all until it outright kills you.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"the one place its actually useful is right as you acquire it. after taking the abductor virgin shortcut to volcano manor, the skip by falling into the lava is just short of lethal without the talisman, so it saves you a few swigs as you explore the way back. but without bridge skip being easy or the trivial ai glitch for fatso, the only real way to get a somber 7 that path is to kill godskin noble a 'fair' way like rot and oh boy is that a big ask at low levels"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,hey caramel is my fav sweet flavor ! also nice to see more sellen shorts
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i used this talisman to get down to the bottom of stormviel castle by the prince of deaths face. it was my first time and i couldn't find the way down yet lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"i use it a lot. it's very useful for me as a host in level 16  30 invasions. i throw myself from a ledge that i've already planned and tested, and the invader always ends up throwing himself behind me in the chase. at these levels the damage makes a lot more difference for the duel"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,i used it once for the backdoor drop in the dlc on the cliffs area
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,my sorceress teacher can't be this cute.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"well it doesn't require the use of a consumable beforehand, nor a dedicated spell slot, fp, or casting animation, making it accessible to all builds. so there is a point to this if you are, say, running through an area where you know or suspect you'll be taking fall damage on the regular because of a particular route you have in mind, as you just pop the talisman on and forget about it until it's time to swap it out for something more practical. now you don't have to go farming for cotton or change your pure martial build around to accommodate a spell you will almost never use. plus it might be a holdover from early development where fall damage was less forgiving and things like the cat talisman might have been more obviously beneficial as your knees shattered after skipping a step on a staircase. in hindsight, such things might have been a justification for dexterity mitigating fall damage an incentive to roll lightly armored dex characters that could abuse the geography more for pvp and pve compared to say the dude bro walking around with literal boulders for armor and weapons so heavy they shift the movement of the stars. and then you just have this thing giving those same builds a chance to do some hardcore parkour without dusting their own skeletons."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,a fall from  15.99001 meters doing damage is such a weird number for the developers to pick.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,"and you can check the fall distance with a rainbow stone. drop it off a ledge, if it breaks then your character won't survive the fall."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,i got chills up my spine. how did she know my skin was caramel
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,this talisman is actually usefull in invasion sometimes if you know the map perfectly and which jump inflict fall damage on you soft cotton is too slow and cant be used while running
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,caramel apprentice shhtooopp blushes
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"it is usable when using torrent, so he does not get damage that will cause him to disappear."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,i grab it right before the skip to inner volcano manor to take the damage away from the drop
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,there is one use... and its when you are doing an all bosses but forget to fight maiden duo. you can mitigate fall damage with a quick tali swap on the first fall you have to do to get down as it can kill you if you dont have any skills against the blackflame monk
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"dexterity lessening fall damage was already a thing in demon's souls but i have no clue if it continued in dark souls 1 and onward, reason i know is because when you level up in demon's souls it shows the affect dexterity has on fall damage."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,you find the cat talisman next to the iron maiden that teleports you to the volcano. youre supposed to use the talisman to jump off the lava on the right to go fight the godskin noble
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-16,this is insane some 40 yr old dude named chuck prolly runs this acct
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,love the macalania background music
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,theres also times where if for whatever reason you can't land and are suspended even if it's only like 2 meters off the ground when you do land you just die
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,caramel apprentice? is it hot in here my face feels warm
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"i know exactly one place where this is useful. caelid divine tower, there's the proper path down, and a slightly easier path that causes fall damage."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i think i only ever used this on the elevator to get the blade of calling.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,in ds1 you could use the equivalent sorcery to drop all the way down the great hollow
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,momma sellen called us caramel.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,the drop leading to bonny village in the dlc makes you take fall damage.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,840 made me laugh. the struggle is real.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i didnt even knew that this talisman exisist..so ye still learn something new every day
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,someone has been watching illusory wall
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,just reminded me of how jumping off a box would hurt you in ds2... like it wasnt enough that they made the hollowing effect brutal aswell
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,i use it for certain ganks on invading spots or just running through areas as fast as i can.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,the cat tali does seem pretty pointless when you have the cotton balls lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,the talisman is useful when you invade with a dragon communion build but that's about it.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,bet you vaati could make an hour long video on how radahn's cat died
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,i suspected dex affected fall damage in ds3 so i'm glad to see it's a thing in elden ring i wonder if it's in other souls games too
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,it can be briefly swapped on to avoid using any mp or items.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,not to mention the number of people who outright died because they read this item's description and thought it would enable them to survive some of those slightly past 20 meters drops.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-17,stormveil castle have 1 drop during an exploration that can make this thing usefull. but at that point we don't have this talisman.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-20,i didn't know it was possible to create such a pretty character in elden.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,they could have made it so the cat charm quadruples the max falling height or made it so it doubles how high you can jump.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,"i could see it being useful in some pvp contexts. imagine being outnumbered and using fall damage reduction to help you escape andor chip away at your opponent's health? like, if they kept following you couldn't you lead them down a path that you'd survive and they'd die?"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-19,i used it once for the crucible knight before valiant gargoyles bc you have to jump down and fight immediately so you cant heal
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,"this might be memories from playing the game unpatched, but i remember getting the that damn cat talisman in the academy, then finding a drop just past the wolf and thinking 'ayo!' only to die anyway. granted, i'm also dumb af, so... could also be a skill issue."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,some talismans are dealers of death. that cat talisman is one of those.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,"from what i've seen, they make it so sometimes a 2 foot fall will instant kill you"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,perhaps it should have done something like double the distance before fall damage starts? anything better than what it released as tbh lol
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"i used it a couple of times, the laser gollem part for example"
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,this is my favorite talisman it looks really cool equipped
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,sirely just swapping on a talisman for a second is better than devoting a spell slot for an otherwise pretty useless spell or farming a relatively rare item
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-14,"they should have brought back the little cat image from demon souls for the cat talisman. it'd still be useless, but id have it on so i can see the cat just there. it'd be cute."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"lmfao i was also gonna recommend soft cotton cor assasin's approach for mitigating fall damage, also you can use rainbow stones to tell if a drop is deadly or not. if the rainbow stone breaks it means the fall ks deadly, if it dosen't then the fall is safe but might ofc reduce ur hp."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-18,let's also talk about the fact that the fall damage range is different in places like for example raya lucaria where you can drop down like 100 meters and take 0
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"if it stacks with cotton and assassin's approach, it might make the lindell, skip faster."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"this is a useful talisman for invaders. have it somewhere close to talisman slot 1 for hardswaps. mitigating fall damage means you can take pathing short cuts that dont result in your taking damage, eliminating the need to heal which saves flasks and time, as well as not revealing your position to defenders. the stairs before the belurat divine lion that overlook the rest of the town come to mind. instead of running all the way down the flight of stairs, you can quickly swap to the talisman and drop down quickly. the other use is when you are being chased as you can go off a high edge and not take damage, but your pursuers will follow and fall allowing a health advantage that can give you time or an opportunity to fight back. can also be used to bait people into lethal falls if you adjust your positioning after the fall. this is a very useful talisman, do not sleep on it."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,"i prefer the assassin's approach, it's a quick cast and doesn't take up an equipment or item slot and i don't really use magic much."
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-12,you know i just realized the implication of the soft cotton is that the character just puts in between their toes or in their shoes depending on what you wear and it literally breaks their fall xd so that implies that their knees or ankles aren't the one's taking damage when you fall it's the goddamn sole of the foot or the toes ???
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-21,markipliersmash next question
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-13,i think you could use the cat talisman in dark souls 2 too jump down the hole before having the ladder place there. but you could also soft lock yourself in there without a way out once you reach the bottom and find out that you need to collect more greater souls.  you cant fast travel until you get the lord vessel. its been quite some time since i played dark souls too so my memories a bit fuzzy.
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-03-15,"reminder that elden ring only has like 4 meters in the fall in which damage is taken and scaled, before it becomes instant death"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-21,shut up you love it
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-11,"that description of the tarnished is actually terrifying in lore, an outer god in a human body"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-31,it's poking my back
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-08-25,"in elden ring, no one is normal"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-11-27,miquella's divine pillar poking radahn through his armor is crazy
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-22,why does placidusax sound like he's about to tell me that we must find martin septim and get him to weynon priory
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-30,if radahn's too irrititated then it must mean its large...
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-30,"sorry, pookie, it must be the frenzy effect"
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-05,nah bro's a freak
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-20,a bitch that couldnt run my fade is wild! bro really loses two heads and was like an eye for an eye! in this case you owe me an arm and a leg mf! i love how gangster placidusax is. bro the og dragon.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-26,placidusax sounding like god is actually my favourite. every elden ring abridged needs to use that voice lol.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-09-29,placidusax saying fade killed me
RPG,Elden Ring,2025-01-04,he's an outer god in a human body. finally! at least someone acknowledges it. even if that person is miquella.

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-28,its poking my back
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-02,placidusaex just has lets kick his ass playing in his head when he remembers bayle.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-12-22,placidusax telling the tarnished about bayle just on the slim chance that he might come across him is peak hatred. placidusax likely didn't know that bayle was in the realm of shadow. he just knew bayle fucking bailed.
RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-05,tarnished be likei hope the shadow realm have normal people messmernope you will not found a normal people here

RPG,Elden Ring,2024-10-31,"the hunter reached the lands of shadows mmm, seems like it's hunting time. who will be my first prey"
