RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-19,"cyberpunk 2077 in 2024, after all the updates, fully deserves a 9. the story is engaging, and night city never fails to impress, making exploration and immersion a joy. the gameplay is more refined and accessible while still offering deep character management, appealing even to those unfamiliar with the setting. an experience that finally lives up to expectations."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-18,"after years the game is almost fixed, i completed the game and it was a good experience, not the best because it still has some bugs, but it was really enjoyable"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-17,"perfect game from every aspect music, character, especially the story man it too good and the night city ohh man when you roam around in night or day or anytime it's just feels surreal the gameplay is amazing side story and all that its just 1010 hands down and the dlc is just fire cd red projectgoat the witcher 3 and than cyberpunk 2077 this is their era and we are living in it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-16,i finished this game an hour ago and while sitting in front of the credits i was so stunned by this game. the release was bad but now 4 years later the its on of the best games out there.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-15,"the comeback that cyberpunk 2077 done must be studied, from a hated game with one of the worst games releases, to an absolute perfection and one of the best rpgs in gaming. a masterpiece that cdpr knew how to turn it 180."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-14,amazing story is so good and graphics are the best the attention to details in the story and map is to good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-13,"po kilku latach od premiery cyberpunk zdecydowanie mona okreli jako bardzo przyjemny tytu. fabua jest ciekawa i questy dobrze napisane, aczkolwiek fabua gwna jest dosy krtka. denerwuje te ogromna ilo znajdziek, zada dodatkowych, ktre ciko jest pomin i nie patrze, a zajmuj 4 razy wicej czasu ni podstawa. na pewno fajny jest wiat przedstawiony, naturalnie napisane dialogi i spjne postacie, ktre bardzo dobrze wpisuj si w wykreowany wiat. zdecydowanie tytu wart uwagi, ale kupowabym tylko na znice"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"quel jeu putain... master classe total aprs avoir fini the witcher quel plaisir denchan avec le jeu futuriste , plong dans ce monde et dans une histoires attachante , surement l'un des meilleures studio , rockstars game a du souci a ce faire . une fin de jeu tellement triste.. avec plusieur fin et les crdits a regarder jusqu la fin."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-12,"listen, this game is fine. it's come a long way since its release, so much has been improved. however, i have a serious problem with this game. i love markiplier, he is my light at the end of my tunnel, but i can't seem to find any footage of him playing this game. because of that, i have to lower my score of this game. however, my other two lights, jacksepticeye and pewdiepie, have played this game. this singlehandedly saves the game from mediocrity or worse, and speaks volumes since such well respected amazing people would play this game. you got lucky this time, cyberpunk watch your back."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-11,"beautiful game and one of the best comeback stories in gaming history. the story is interesting, especially the way they made more than one main storyline. the voice acting is really good, there are a lot of interesting side characters, hidden eastereggs, and beautifully written endings in the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-04,"this is not the game cd projekt red promised. but still it is one of my favorite games with its story, music and characters. i'm in love with the vibes of cyberpunk 2077. it still gives me the chills when i hear new dawn fades or see that rooftop with v holding the bullet necklance in his hand. cyberpunk 2077 is a game i'll still talk and think about even when i'm 70 years old."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-02,"this isn't a bad game, it's just not what was promised. it's not an rpg. it's an action adventure game. choices don't matter, you can literally skip all the dialogue. yes, they have improved it since launch, but it's not what was advertised. regardless, they are improving it, but it's basically just a weak shooter looter."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"easily the best game i've ever played, i'm 26 now and i do play games, a lot of games, since i was about 35 years old and this is the best game i've ever played on all those years, the world is alive, the story is a 1110, dialogue and writing is the driving factor here. my opinion is based on what i look for in games, a great story to tell, great writing and great vibes, gameplay is not that much important to me cause bugs every game have, the score is also amazing it adds so much to the atmosphere."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-03-01,"i avoided the game on launch as i do with so many aaatitles these days, that are simply not worth my time and money. picked it up recently in sale and i have to say one of the best, fast paced rpgs i've ever played. i love the vibe they created, from driving through the mesmerizing city to the way people speak. well deserved of a positive review by now, hopefully the next one is on this level at launch and i will buy it earlier."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-24,i like this game. in many ways you're like watching a high budget action movie or something. female v voice actor is amazing!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-19,"4.8 between bad and avarage, they built their marketing strategies on the idea of that this game was a true rpg, but when it was released, not only it was not a rpg, it was also broken to the point of being unplayable. moreover, the game itself wasnt that good, and v is a very boring person."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-25,es un juego con muy buena historia con una caracterizacin que te mete profundamente en el juego como ami con unos grficos muy buenos.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-24,"tirando os bugs de desempenho e de gameplay,o jogo  timo.. histria muito boa, gameplay tima de se jogar."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,"i actually love this game. i'm having a blast playing on my ps5 base ps5, v2.21. so why the bad review? duplicate npcs bug on pc v2.1. while i hardly ever see dupe npcs on my ps5 in 15 hours of play time i've seen them 34 times, and a couple of those were looking for them, on pc i was seeing them constantly with ease, even triplets. i have a good pc ssd, 4060 ti gpu, etc. so it's not a specs problem. i also monkeyed with a bunch of settings but the dupes show up even on low graphics, etc. they are frequent enough to break immersion and spoil the game. it's a great game on ps5 but pc needs to fix the dupe npcs bug maybe version 2.3?."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-22,joguei a verso de ps5. e meus amigos q jogo foda.platinei dps de90h de game. e ai da vou jogar a dlc e tbm avalia. n tive nenhum bug ou problema. e q histria foda. um dos melhores q joguei.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"i played this way back when it was broken and had bags of fun even then. luckily its fixed now and still fun, story is good and its kinda funny seeing keanu reeves pop up constantly. enjoyed thoroughly, side content is the best part but the main story is decent also."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-18,"played it for 12 hrs and i cant really push myself anymore. extremely boring and plain open world with absolutely zero interesting quests and situations. one million garbage useless mechanics that distract player from already plain and boring 25 year old gameplay. story is ok, but since there is no immerse in the game i couldnt really enjoy it. most main story characters are caricature and formulaic. would rather call this game far cry 2077. bugs are still there lol"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-16,"hands down the best game i ever played. i 100ed it twice. judy  panam. excellent main quest loads of easily accessible side quests. could have used amore prominent guild system but, wasn't held back"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-11,"no momento no qual joguei, o jogo tinha uma historia perfeita , gameplay incrivel, porm pecava muito com bugs e mal otimizao , e fala bug nisso, se no fosse por esse problema, sem duvidas o cyberpunk 2077 sria uma nota 10 facilmente , porm nas minhas avaliaes, eu geralmente diminuo 2 pontos se o jogo obtiver bug ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-10,"analizar un videojuego es muy subjetivo porque las impresiones que puedo tener yo como usuario no son las mismas que puede tener otra persona. por eso hablar de un videojuego tan polmico como cyberpunk es por poco un dilema. yo dar me mis impresiones personales. lo bueno  a nivel grafico creo que solo red dead redemption 2 puede ser punto de comparacin. increble.  night city es la ciudad original mas hermosa creada en un mundo abierto. y competencia directa de grandes ciudades de referencia como las presentadas en assassin's creed que aunque no compiten grficamente no son referente por la sensacin que transmitan al recorrer sus calles.  la historia es muy buena, con varios finales y buena narrativa. para los amantes de la ciencia ficcin es lo que se busca. el sistema de disparos es genial.  la msica es futurista, incluso en las clsicas. lo malo  jugndolo un ao despus y con todos los parches que han salido aun se consiguen varios bugs que son molestos.  la progresin de las misiones secundarias no es tan lograda, con las tpicas llamadas de ir de aqu para all, rbate esto o mata a aquel personaje.  no sientes una verdadera progresin de personaje, se siente mucho a aco en este aspecto. antiguo si se quiere. los combates cuerpo a cuerpo no estn muy bien logrados."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-09,"cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best rpg experiences i've ever had in my life. i confess, i was very reticent about playing this, because of the rough launch and the disappointment that many players had over the game. but now that i played it, i can say for sure that cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best rpg's ever made. cd projekt red manage somehow to raise the game from the state that it was, and fix it entirely, giving the players the best experience possible. the story is amazing. not only the main part of it, but all the side quests and side stuff too. all the parts of the narrative are very well written and well structured. the main story however is the highest point of the game, pairing with the character development that really meant a lot to me. i can't say that there is one character that's not interesting or not appealing. all the people that cross with v are important in some way, for his progress and development throughout the course of the game. the quest design is peak entertainment. every single main quest is very unique, with his own very original style. i can remember several quests and moments that blew my mind and left me breathtaked during my playthrough. the side stuff is very appealing too, because it rewards you as the player to do them. all the gigs, the side job's and so on. it is in fact rewarding for the player to lose time with them. on top of that, there are so many different job's inside these side quests, that it doesn't get repetitive. talking about the world of cyberpunk, night city is just breathtaking. the city feels very alive because of the density of crowd on the streets, the different factions in the different districts, and many other elements that make you feel like you're really there, with v, exploring the city and all it's corners. the gameplay, to finish this mini review, is top notch. the gunplay is very enjoyable with each gun feeling very unique and fun to play with. the exploration feels really different from anything else, because of all the interiors and buildings. the hacking system is just amazing, much better than other games that are entirely focused on it, with many possibilities do to whatever you want, and approach every situation as you please."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-07,at first i was hesitant to purchase this game but after playing just the first few missions i was blown away. the side missions didnt feel like filler like in lots of these new aaa games and the main story was just so intriguing. the gameplay also felt very smooth and the progression system didnt feel sluggish. i only had a few problems with the game like the fluctuating frame rate. overall a true masterpiece in this genre of media
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,the game to this day still misses most of what was promised in the trailers
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-06,"cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time. six months ago, i completed both the base game and the phantom liberty expansion, earning the platinum trophy, and i loved every second of it. now, i find myself itching to dive back into the chaotic, neonlit streets of night city once again. i cant wait for the sequel! the story struck a deep chord with me  it hasnt let go even to this day. lines from the game still echo in my mind, and ive grown attached to so many characters, all of whom are written and developed brilliantly. even after 180 hours of gameplay, the combat never got old, and there are still countless ways to approach missions, develop my character, and experience the game differently. lately, a lot of games feel soulless, failing to evoke any real emotions. but cyberpunk 2077? it has heart. it has depth. and thats why i cherish it so much. i know the game had a rough launch, plagued by technical issues, crashes, and an almost unplayable state on playstation. but i have immense respect for the developers for not abandoning it. instead, they kept refining and improving it, turning it into something truly spectacularand delivering an incredible expansion on top of that. thank you, cd projekt red, for making this masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-05,fantastic game. augmentations really give you a ton of options. the smart weapons are my favorite.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-04,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-03,"boring af. stuffed full of trivial minutia busywork, longwinded npc blathering, with the occasional clunky combat spinkled in here and there. so glad i didn't pay for this overrated garbage."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-02,"i played this game in january 2025, and it's truly spectacular. addicting gameplay, complete and diverse mechanics between being a cyber samurai, a shooter or a hacker, wonderful open world with great visuals and immersive cyberpunk futuristic  narrative is amazing, and so are the characters. v is great i played with male v but johnny silverhand is just one of the, if not the most, greatest video games characters of all times. and i am not exaggerating when saying this is, in fact, keanu reaves best performance yet. and panam... what to say about her... simply the best romance in video games history, extremely relevant to v's arc, the plot in general and author of the best ending possible.soundtrack is amazing. dlc is fantastic idris elba as solomon reed and songbird are spectacularit's definitely a 1010 game. i know it had a lot of issues when it launched, but now it's a perfect game. a jewell from cd project red that leaves me with a lote of hope and enthusiasm for the witcher 4, the witcher remake and of course, cyberpunk sequel."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-02-01,"played the full version 2025. this was an awesome experience. everything is fun, everything is well crafted and mechanics are really well implemented. rpg system was flawless. story wise... there are some lose ends, but nothing too wrong, also there were some minor bugs related with physics but nothing out of the ones that make you laugh."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-31,"this game has so many bugs it made me question my own pc. but even with all the bugs and glitches, this is as good as it gets for open world games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,decent game. graphics have its highlights but especially the npcs look and behave horrible. gungame is just decent and the preset settings are just bad. didnt like the boss fights as they were just annoyingly long but not hard oder challenging
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-28,"so to keep it short and sweet. bought the game in march of 2021, such a hot mess, uninstall within two days. blurdigital pixels ahead to decemeber 2024. yes, yes, more please. this is the game i wanted, it's great, fun game play, fun dialogs, indepth characters and more. it still has it's issues, but its at bare minimal and it's more to my taste and wants versus overall game play. graphics are beautiful. in a way, it followed v time line, game was close to dying, but it found its life line. save the day"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-27,"definitely one of the best revival stories in gaming. what started out as a glitched mess has turned into probably one of the best fps rpgs out today. they legit fixed almost every technical issue the game had, and added some good content to the game. worth  if you haven't gotten it et."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-27,"very good visuals, the worlduniverse is very interesting and has so much potential for future projects. unfortunately the base game even with all the updates 2.2 still feels like it was rushed and was half baked even more when compared to phantom liberty which feels like a different game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,"a gorgeous game with a welldeveloped universe that really draws you in. cyberpunk is not just a game about killing and going on missions, it is a game about the importance of choice, about building relationships with other characters and thereby creating your own history of not just becoming legend of night city, and also developing v's story and his future, lifepath. it is an honor for me that i was able to allow myself to touch such a masterpiece from an equally wonderful studio with an amazing game director. would you rather live in peace as mr. nobody, die ripe, old and smelling slightly of urine? or go down for all times in a blaze of glory, smelling near like posies, without seeing your thirtieth?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-25,they really turned this game around from the bad launch. props to cdpr. it has become a favorite of mine. 10 out of 10
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,"this game is truly an experience. i can't even use words how much i love that masterpiece. i may sound like a fanatic, but in my opinion literally everything is perfect about this game, story, mechanics, story telling, development, world building, every characters and building. this game has something inside that just makes me stay in night city for long long hours. every game i play i usually abandon it after finishing main story or spending some time but in cyberpunk 2077 i just want to stay there, i just want to play even for the 10th time and experience this art once again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-21,oyun hatalarndan arndrlm yapay zeka hareketleri ve rol yapma ksm ok iyi olmasa da oyun ok gzel. oyunun en iyi rol yapma ksm sonda bulunuyor.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-17,"had to give 2077 a 610 due to it's lack of optimization  but the world and story is engaging. worth a pirate, not a purchase. the bugs, glitches, and crashes made the game feel like a labor of greed rather than a labor of love. it's why i waited until 2025 to try the game as i heard how bad it was at launch. it is still a hot mess, but playable, just save often."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-16,"i created an account just to rate this incredible game, which has quickly become one of my alltime favorites. i came in with low expectations, but it has pleasantly surprised me in nearly every aspect. i absolutely love this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-15,"horrible first year. i had pre ordered and decided to not get a refund no regrets. i just waited for it to be ready,. cyberpunk turned out to be an amazing game, it just took time. hopefully this is a lesson to all companies to not rush a product. make sure it is ready. cyberpunk is a top 15 game all time for me. it might be a top 10, somewhere in between. it's absolutely worth every dollar. there's a lot of great content, characters and stories. i hope they release another game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"1  simplesmente um dos melhores jogos que j joguei na minha vida, no em questo tcnica, o jogo tem muitos problemas no ps5, porm em questo de gameplay, diverso, histria e construo de mundo,  incrvel, voc tem diversas maneiras de jogar e de seguir sua histria. 2  problemas que encontrei durante minha jogatina tenho 150h no game e o jogo crashou diversas vezes, umas 5 no mnimo, tem alguns bugs tambm de veculos e npcs entrando no cho, mas o jogo  to divertido que no chegou a me incomodar sinceramente, mas os bugs esto l mesmo que sejam poucos, so notveis. 3  a dlc phantom liberty  incrvel, adiciona muita coisa ao jogo e voc percebe o carinho que tiveram no desenvolvimento. eu definitivamente recomendo o game,  uma experincia nica"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-14,"the story is short and depressing, it didn't satisfy me at all. the gameplay gets boring after a while, and the feeling of impact is terrible. it built up so much expectation and failed to deliver on any of it. i played it in the beginning, and i let it go back then because it was full of bugs, but nothing has changed. the game is still trash, in my opinion. its open world feels extremely lifeless, with just npcs and cars that spawn for no reason."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-13,"i'm chipping in, cyberpunk is the future of gaming, this is the ultimate game i have been looking for my entire life. the night city, the storyline, this game is an absolute masterpiece"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-11,"i recognize that the game has numerous bugs and issues, but it remains a fantastic experience due to its solid mechanics and compelling story. i genuinely enjoyed playing it, and it's impressive that a game set in 2077 can be so engaging! however, i do take issue with the jokes made about our creator, jesus christ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-08,"story, gameplay, graphics, atmosphere. everything in this game is perfect, literally everything. this is a masterpiece!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-06,"playing in 2025... starting with the bad open world is small, since it seems like one can't really create an urban open world or modern open world that feels real, maybe don't try. night city is tiny and there's no traffic jams. glitches, hats don't work properly. encountered one weird stretching glitch when a body was dismembered. they still need to proof read the text, i teach english to migrants and refugees and their writing is often more comprehensible than texts i have encountered in game. guns, don't use them in your game if you don't know how they work. they put too much effort into making the guns gamey. shoulda made the combat much more deadly instead of sending more bullet sponges at you. guns, cyberwear, perks all involve too much incremental change and or differences between options. vehicles handle ridiculously and defy physics. makes me wonder if the devs even drive. you can't really defy or rage against the dystopia and even if you did there wouldn't be any consequences. i keep accidentally hurting civvies and the cops hardly care and when they do they quickly forget. the good graphics voice acting, characters, story and art. they really convey the horror of a multicultural degenerate anarchocapitalist hell with the gross ads and prostitution simulation. at the smaller scale the environments, individual building interiors, are well designed to allow for multiple play styles and feel more or less realistic besides too many indestructible windows. conclusion"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-04,"one of the best of its kind. this game is very good at taking you from your chair to night city. very immersive, very cinematic, sometimes kinda boring but overall its an unforgettable experience"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2025-01-02,"based on 2024 latest patch,my whole playtrough 95free of bugs,the futuristic city is cramped with small little detail everywhere,especially most indoor area have a very detailed futuristiccomplicated led lightsdesigntoo ambitious no wonder game launch was disastroussmoothfun gunplay,most of the main story heistmission was really goodepic,overall game structure feels like playing gtawitcher3 with wide variety of moderately fun sidequest"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-31,not as good as promised. the game was launched when it was not finished. the delelopers try since then to finish the game with patches but it still feels a little bit unfinished.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-29,"i am not your bro, especially when the first time i try to launch the game nothing happens, the second time it plays an advert for the witcher 4, and the 3rd time it tries to get me to download amd software. 4th attempt at finally getting in it calls me their own made up slang version of bro on a legal document. one of the worst most  launches in the past 5 years, and doing nothing to redeem themselves."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-22,"best game ever, i mainly loves the vibes. besides that, characters and combat mechanics are 1010 if not 910."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,"best game ever, period. the graphics, actors, plot, it is just insane what this game is capable of."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-21,"absolute masterpiece with one of the best plots in videogames. even thought the launch was a pure mess, the developers fixed many annoying issues. visually stunning with engaging gameplay, top notch music, and memorable characters. cant wait for the release of witcher 4."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-09,"a visually stunning rpg with deep lore, actionpacked gameplay, and style!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,"a perfect example of quantity over quality. the game is visually appealing, and tries to do so many different things. but the story telling and main character lines were so bad that its hard to find reasons to come back and play it. i played it with the pathtracing mode on pc and the developers deserve some serious recognition for what they accomplished! but this game took me over a year to finally finish. i found that i was desperately trying to skip every bit of dialog just to get back out and explore the world. but then the world didn't have very much charisma or charm, and was generally buggy. i would hit a barricade while driving vehicle handling is aweful and if i was within 10 feet of a police officer, they would freak out and attack me with full force. the experience of driving around the city ended up becoming annoying and frustrating. if you have a pathtracing capable pc, i would recommend picking it up on a sale and playing it to experience what truly incredible lighting looks like. but i don't recommend this game in any other form."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-17,"one of the most boring games ever created. they put so much effort into the hype, and keep upgrading graphics, but in a nutshell, the game has extremely weak and outdated mechanics, even fallout 3 still feels fresher than that. it's like a regular polish shooter with cheap cyberpunk skins and designs made by some scholars, despite all their hard work on improving ray tracing stuff, etc. i waited for it for years and prebought it, and simply couldn't believe how bad everything was when launched it first and tried to have fun for 1015 hours, then gave it another try one year later and the game was still bad af but with better graphics. feels like a complete scam."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,"the first time i played a game and i did not want it to end. the only thing not s tier about this title is the open world immersion and the gameplay systems could be more, but what gameplay systems are there are amazing. combat story and art direction are s tier."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-03,cyberpunk 2077 ha sido una experiencia que realmente me ha dejado huella desde que me adentr en night city me sorprendi lo viva que se siente la ciudad con cada rincn oscuro y cada paisaje futurista tan bien detallado que parece que realmente podras caminar por ah la historia me atrap desde el principio con personajes que no solo son memorables sino que tambin se sienten muy reales conectados con las emociones y dilemas que plantea la narrativa cada decisin que tomas tiene un impacto y eso me hizo sentir que realmente estaba moldeando el mundo a mi alrededor ya fuera a travs del sigilo la confrontacin directa o la tecnologa aunque el juego tuvo sus problemas al principio no puedo negar que ha mejorado mucho con las actualizaciones y la expansin phantom liberty ha aadido an ms contenido que hace que el universo de night city se sienta an ms rico la narrativa sigue siendo increble y la atmsfera y los grficos me siguen sorprendiendo es un juego que demuestra la habilidad de cd projekt red para crear mundos inmersivos y contar historias complejas si buscas algo que combine accin exploracin y una historia profunda cyberpunk 2077 es una opcin que vale la pena
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-15,"even after a large number of updates, the game is full of bugs.boring mechanics, nothing special and new."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-14,"cyberpunk 2077 is a stunningly beautiful, funny, and over all entertaining game. if you enjoy having the freedom to do whatever you want like me spending the first 3 hours playing the game just exploring the map, and doing side missions for no reason whatsoever then this will be your  course a game of this magnitude does not come without its technical difficulties, however even with a midtier system like my own i have been able to enjoy the game in its entirety. i can say that i am very happy with how vigilant the developer has been with communicating that they want to perfect the product as much as they can.i was not a hype beast for cyberpunk, and i can say without a shadow of a doubt its lived up to all the hype ive seen about it, and i cant wait to see what the developers do with the game going forward. so let me stop reviewing so i can actually beat this game at some point."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-12-05,"a jack of all trades, master of none, leads to a shallow experience that's still oftentimes fun. almost half a decade after its release, cyberpunk 2077 is a fully playable, mostly glitchfree, and enjoyable experience that does everything well yet stands out in no particular category except graphics. its open world, dialogue, rpg elements, progression system, characters, stealth mechanics, combat, gunplay, hacking, movement  parkour, loot drops, car handling, and basically anything you can think feel fine on the surface and are incredibly fun to engage with, yet the second you put many of these systems to even a remotely belowthesurface stress test or compare them to many other games, they quickly show to be pretty shallow. the characters are written incredibly well, yet with how little time i actually spent with many of them, i never really got fully attached to any of them, nor did i ever feel like i ever got to really know them. while it is great to see systems like the cops spawning and despawning 5 meters away from you not be in the game anymore, there are still times where they literally saw me through a wall and on one occasion through an entire house, because apparently they have eagle eye or something. the many hours you will spend in dialogue are mostly written well, yet with how many times the game gives you two options that literally say the exact same thing, i wonder why the game gave me any choices at all. one of the first options when you talk to dexter deshawn is literally you saying either, yeah, i wanna go out in a blaze of glory or if you die a nobody, nobody will remember you, so yeah, i wanna go out in a blaze of glory or dodging the question entirely. why are they in the game? they just slow down the pacing of an otherwise interesting conversation. the combat with both regular enemies and jackedup cyberpsychos is great fun, and the game gives you a pretty decent amount of fun and powerful options to deal with them. yet in regular cdpr fashion, many of these can be boiled down to mindnumbingly boring tactics once you know how the game works. oh, and expect enemies to uppercut the air 5 feet away from where you're standing and for you to still take damage. the stealth is actually handled pretty decently for their first attempt at it, yet you can't pickpocket enemies, you can't just hit one button and kill them with your melee weapon, nor can you shoot a silenced pistol at a camera without the entire building now somehow knowing you're somewhere close to them, or hide an unconscious enemy into a dumpster without killing them for some reason. enemies in most side quests will be completely neutral towards you, giving you plenty of options to plan your approach. yet open a door you shouldn't, step half a foot into a restricted area oftentimes without you even knowing, because none of the enemies ever tell you to back off or to not go through a door, since you can't actually talk to most of them, and within a millisecond every enemy in a milewide radius will turn hostile and instantly try to gun you down. save a girl from getting beaten up by someone she doesn't say anything, just crouches on the floor with her hands above her head and stays there till the end of  can buy dozens of different vehicles, yet you can't customise them at all except changing the color on a few. the movement in the game feels really fluent, yet the city isn't really designed in a way where you can use your parkour skills to your advantage. the skill tree is diverse and leads to very differentfeeling playthroughs, yet in dialogue it is only used for v to be able to say additional lines of dialogue, without them ever changing how a quest plays out. trust me, i could just go on and on. but in short cyberpunk 2077 is a very fun game whenever the developers decide to just let you loose and give you quests that allow for player creativity. for my personal taste, it is easily the most fun game they have ever made, once you take the game for what it is. just don't go in expecting to be blown away. 610, 710 on a good day"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-30,"no game has ever conflicted me like this game... it is an interesting experience for sure, but it could have been so much more. the game lacks so many things that make a good rpg, but also lacks so many things that make a good linear game. it is really an anomaly. in the end, the world is not well developped and the story is very bad. the gameplay is mixed aswell. it is mindless fun, but to the point where you really have to be mindless. they bring up very interesting topics, without giving the depth required for it to be nuanced. the wirld ends up just being a disgusting sex joke and gangbanging nonsense with a twist of underdevelloped scifi. honestly a bad take on each genre and i am really disappointed!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,"best open world city ever. and it's not a gta city that's just a small version of the real life one, it's an entirely fictional futuristic city with the best lore and characters and npcs. you just need to forget about your futuristic gta assumption to understand how great this game is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-29,"the developers put all of their heart and soul to make this a game where you feel for other people  where you develop warm connections and see human nature in all of its forms, for better and for worse. and even in the games shortcomings  you see the trials that the people behind the game had to go through in making it an actual product. it is the single most human game ive ever played and it may be the most sobering piece of art ive ever played in my life."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-27,"one of the best story game i got hooked on every character in thus game, the lore and the npc is the carrying part i cant lie, the transportation system, the car that we get to drive, the versatility of builds that we could use, this just straight heaven for those who looking to spend an amount of time  !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-25,"damn, this game was so addictive. it is probably not my favourite game i have played in the last couple of years because, but it is packed with so many things you can do. i found myself wanting to enter this world way too often than i should.  so yeah, this had a big impact on my recent life too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-21,"cyberpunk 2077 on pc  a story of redemption when cyberpunk 2077 first launched, it felt like a massive disappointment. the glitches and performance issues were impossible to ignore, and ill admit, i wasnt sure if cd projekt red could recover. but now, playing the updated version on pc, its clear that theyve done the impossibletheyve turned a rocky launch into one of the most polished gaming experiences out there. the way the developers handled the updates and bug fixes deserves praise. it wasnt just about patching things up they went above and beyond, addressing player feedback and improving nearly every aspect of the game. night city feels alive, the performance is buttery smooth, and every corner of the world has a level of detail thats honestly breathtaking. with each update, theyve added content that not only enhances the story but makes exploration and gameplay even more rewarding. cyberpunk 2077 is now what it was meant to bea masterpiece that combines incredible storytelling, an immersive open world, and gameplay that hooks you from start to finish. the dedication of cd projekt red to overcome the odds and deliver on their promises is something we dont see often in this industry. if you were hesitant before, nows the time to dive in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-21,"this is a masterpiece. aside from still some minor bugs this was a blast to play. i don't always finish single player games but this one hits the spot. the world building, characters, story and gameplay are phenomenal."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-20,"really good storyline and decision making. action feels amazing. stealth too. decent customization. radio variety is cool. vehicle variety is nice. the game has several nice views. riding vehicles feels good in both first and third person. what makes me subtract from 10? i can't get inbetween all the floors of the first megabuilding where v lives, which is gigantic, and you can see people standing in those floors too. all enemies scale with your progress. trauma team is just a plot device, they don't appear in random encounters, you can't interact with them in any way, nothing. you really have to try hard to get all pursuit stars, only to hide yourself for a bit and lose them all at the same time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-10,"it has officially become my favorite game it's incredible. the story, the graphics, the setting, the dlc, and everything elsei could play it for years without ever getting bored! it's amazing. 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,cyberpunk has completely remade and fixed everything. i wish bioware would listen to cd project red. can't wait for the witcher.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-19,"so as i've played version 2.13 i can say that the game is now playable. of course from time to time you will find minor issues but it won't affect your gameplay. however technical issues might be fixed there's still other problems. i was amazed by this game at first yet after 40 hours i was struggling. it gets boring and repetitive. story is keeping, it's the gameplay... more of doing the same thing over and over. because of bugs it could never recive 10, because of repetitivnes it can't be 9. anyway i'll give it 8 cause it's still very good game with incredible story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-18,"i started playing cyberpunk 2077 in 2024 on the ps5, and fortunately, all the significant bugs have been fixed. the game is fantastic and incredibly immersive i truly feel like im living in night city. its a masterpiece, and i want to play it forever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-12,its a pretty good game with damn fun combat and cool aesthetics. the story was interesting and engaging though the male romance companions were very very underdeveloped. loved johnny though. it had potential to be great but alas fell short.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-12,"even at launch, despite the frustrations, id rate this game an 810. now, with the major issues resolved and the game finally delivering the intended experience, i consider it a masterpiece by cd projekt red. this world and its story are sure to be remembered even a decade from now. in my opinion, this is truly an outstanding nextgen title."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-10,"even on release and how frustrating it was, it was to me an 810. now after all the mistakes were fixed and the game feels proper now.. sometimes. i think its a masterpiece created by cdprojectred. this world and story will be looked back on a decade from now. it helps that edgerunners anime is also such good cyberpunk lore and amazing writing added on to that. its just an amazing next gen title imo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-10,this is one of the best games i've ever played and i've played a lot of games. the world is just so incredibly immersive. the combat is fun and you feel like your a part of night city. incredible work cdpr
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-09,"good graphics, great voice acting, very interesting world, cool missions, but the game is boring! i'm 9 hours in, just started act 2, and i have literally been in two action sequences. the rest is just talking heads and getting from point a to point b. those 5 really awesome skill trees? don't bother with them, because combat is about 15 of the game. really hope that it picks up soon..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-09,version 2.1 mit mods und pathtracing wohl das beste was ich je in meinem leben spielen durfte danke cdpr fr die beste spielzeit meines lebens danke danke danke
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-09,"cdpr has some of the best script writers in gaming. this game is full of personal interactions and stories with amazing motion capture and realism. the attention to detail like future slang words and costumes. every character has a story. this game could easily be more linear and work, as once you get into the game. it's actually about the smaller moments. the beautiful detailed open world becomes window dressing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-09,this game  and its cost a lot its not worth john wick getting your brain its kinda a sx sim
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-07,"played on ps5 2 years after its release, it wasn'tthe 2.0 version yet arrived 1 year after and the experience was clearly the worst i had in the last 20 years. nothing worked, from incoherent conception of the city to the npc's ai during missions. i had a lot of really breaking the game bugs, a fair amount of softlocks and a ton of minor bugs. the city was emptywith no life, the driving system was a mess, ennemies could shot through walls... to me, no matter how much they worked on the game afterwards, they should never have released it in that condition, thus is not respectful towards the players."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-04,"i liked the story. gameplay was decent. voice acting is excellent. basicallyl and open world, first person shooter in the same vein as grand theft auto's vice city and newer. with a touch of deus ex,  that makes any sense. game had a rough release, but it's been patched and fixed.  got in game engine nudity censored, after it's second patch, too."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,"cyberpunk 2077 has taught all of us a good lesson  never preorder any games, period. no matter how amazing the company has been previously, any company is capable of messing up its release. cyberpunk 2077 may have been patched and improved significantly post release, but this will never excuse the awful decision to release it in a broken state. for context, police chases weren't even a thing in cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,"one of the best games that has been ever made, it has a rocky start, but cdpr has shown their dedication and fixed it, also they added alot of things and made it a master piece, i have even created mods for this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,"the combat and side missions can become extremely repetitive but the wellwritten story, extensive character creator and pulsating soundtrack more than make up for a few small gripes i have with the game, overall. if you have even the slightest infatuation with cyberpunk style and enjoyed the movie blade runner, then this game will be right up your alley and well worth the money spent."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-11-01,after a rough launch this game was developed into a masterpiece that is a lot of fun to play and well written

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-30,"the immersion is crazy, the gameplay is very fun, the music is beautiful, the quests are incredible, the characters very well written.. the amount of content in the game is huge, it took me 100 hours to finish it. i know some people are upset about how the game used to be broken but personally i was lucky enough to discover this game in an almost perfect state because i am only playing it now in 2024, for me this game is clearly one of the best of all time, and it is one of my favorites."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-28,"cyberpunk 2077 in 2024 is masterpiece. phenomenal story, amazing characters, night city is vibrant and full of activities."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-27,i cant kill any children. they have iframes and they disappear whenever i enter a car.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-27,"most music is great. the gunplay is fun. the voice acting varies from very good to great. the cutscenes are great. the visuals are great. the quickhacking mechanic is fun. the story is captivating. there are many places to explore. the side quests are quite interesting. and the replayability is high because there are a lot of abilities you can use. there are bugs, but they couldn't break my enjoyment of this game. i played 100 hours before the 2.0 update, beating the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-25,"the gameplay overall is pretty good. there are still some bugs, but nothing gamebreaking for me. the problem is that night city feels quite superficial and i find the story lacking, especially the endings. i've played through it 2 times, both times the endings were very unsatisfactory and didn't really fit the gameplay powerfantasy and story i was going through. your decisions don't really have any impact. so i checked online and apparently all endings are bad endings. now, i don't mind a bad ending rdr 2 did it so well... but overall it works better in movies imo, but in an interactive game like cyberpunk you should have a certain impact on where you want to go with the story. all the effort and time you put into the game doesn't get rewarded in the end if you wanted, because the writers wanted to be edgy with the thought in night city there are no good endings. so yeah, play it for the gameplay. don't expect much storywise, specially the endings. edit oh yeah, the driving physics are absolutely horrendous...."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-10,"cyberpunk 2077 is in my opinion the best game ever made. no, it is not of the best quality, that title belongs to red dead redemption 2, but that does not mean that cyberpunk 2077 is of low quality. cyberpunk 2077 is a combination of several things that appeal to me the most. it is set in the city of mertopol, it is a heavy action game, it has a realistic story, it has lovable characters, it has great freedom of play and game mechanics, and of course it has main and side quests that support them. i am not talking about the 2020 version of cyberpunk 2077. because i played this game at the beginning of 2024. i know how wrong cyberpunk is in 2020, but that does not concern me, i did not come across these because i played it 3 years later. it was much better this way because i experienced such a masterpiece in its polished form, not in its bad form. the scenario of cyberpunk 2077 could have been great in my opinion, if it had not ended the story in a few main quests. if the plot ends too quickly, that's one of the biggest problems for me, but that's all, the scenario concept characters, especially johnny's concept universe, all had great potential, but unfortunately it was a bit wasted. the only flaw for me in terms of gameplay is that sometimes you get a very nice reaction when you hit, sometimes you don't. unfortunately, it's unbalanced, but as i said, other than that, you can develop and use your character as you want, and the mechanics are nice, both diverse and satisfying, limb amputations, etc. are a bit unbalanced but very nice. the game also stands out in level and mission design, there is a level design suitable for every approach style. my only problem with this is that there are not enough action sequences. i wish there were more like the part where jackie died in the prologue section where we missed hanako arasaka, but unfortunately there isn't, but despite this, the level designs are great, you can indirectly or semidirectly affect the side quests with your choices, it's great. although the npcs in the open world are stupid, the atmosphere of the open world is there, i'm done with this, i'm finishing night city. just walking around is fun, there are activities you can do, many short side quests that bring the city to life, etc. are very nice. the character side quests are already great, each character is enjoyable in their own way. the visuals have the best visuals i've seen, but the problem is that unfortunately we can't see this beautiful open world and visuals from the 3rd person, it's a pity that i don't like the fbs camera, but despite this, cyberpunk 2077 drew me in. in terms of performance, almost everything was fixed in the patch that came out with the phantom liberty dlc. i didn't encounter too many glitches. there is no other game that i've been as immersed in as cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-24,"playing the game at it's finished state now, it really is one of the very best games i've ever played, story, music, visualsboth from a graphics and art direction perspective, everything is top notch. you can clearly see those are the same guys that made the witcher 3. don't be discouraged by its rough start, at this point this game is a must play for anyone who enjoys action and rpgs, great extensive experiences and expansive worlds to explore."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-23,"the game is now where it should have been at launch. the rough start made it lose some of it's momentum, but at least they fixed the problem and left the game in the state it deserves. the world is amazing, the story is top notch, and the freedom to play the way you want is really what makes it great. it really is a game that earns your time and money with every hour you spend enjoying the content. i'm happy there was a good ending for night city after all, if you know what i mean."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-22,"este juego es increble. si tenis dudas compradlo en una oferta. yo lo consegu por 30  en la store y de verdad que es de lo mejor que he jugado en mucho tiempo. no recomiendo jugarlo en playstation cuatro por los tiempos de carga y posibles crashes, pero este juego en playstation 5 es espectacular y probablemente en un pc bueno tambin. las posibilidades, la historia, la jugabilidad, el sigilo y el ambiente cyberpunk de esta ciudad inmensa hacen de este juego algo sobresaliente"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-04,gives the feeling of a world that's just a videogame. it does not have the interactivity and immersion that all quality open worlds have in common.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-03,i havnt played it before but after the 2.0 update i bought it on ps5 and it is amazing. the graphics the story and the driving. i like it. and i would say it is the true next gen game i mean games like ragnarok are on last gen and new gen. but because this is so bad for last gen they have completelly ditxhed the last gen after 2.0 and now they take full advantage of next gen. ps5 has performance mode 60 fos and ray tracing 30 fos woth shadiw raytracing no reflection though. but i like to play performance and it isstable not 60 fos all the time but generally it stays close to 60. so it is smooth enough for me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,definitely one of my all time favorites. although i hated it when i played it at release. now the game feels entirely different. they really showed how much dedication they had towards it by fixing it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-10-01,"it is not worth it, except if you can play for free. many people look to get paid for good reviews. the developers spend more time deciding whether the characters have small or large  than on creating good gameplay and a decent story."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-29,"cyberpunk 2077 is a controversy. you can see and feel that is a good game, but some things put my rating down. first, night city is indeed breathtaking. the city was built with care, they've put a lot of details and memorable places. you really can feel the cyberpunk vibe and style. the gameplay is nice, the combat feels good, and you can sense the weapon's weight, recoil, etc. shooting enemies is satisfactory. still, i wouldn't like the character customization in a firstperson view game, because you do not see your character in 90 of the game. the driving mechanics is average. the graphics are good, and some facial animations like panam's and judy's are awesome. but the faces of the generic npc's are not good. the soundtrack is astonishing, each song gives the feeling of being in a futuristic world. the sound effects are good overall. we need to address the main topic of cyberpunk 2077, and that is the story. the main story is great, the first 6 hours were straight fire, and after that, you have more liberty to explore and do gigs and whatnot. however, those side quests are a little repetitive. with 80 hours of gameplay, i was forced to rush to the final mission because i've got bored. i could finish the game on hard despite the gigs i didn't do. now, why my rating is 6 for this game, being that i liked the game? cd projekt red, the launch, bugs, and glitches. cdpr lied to the gamers in many ways 1.000 npc's with daily routines, allowing journalists and youtubers with early access to show just restricted footage, lying in advertising and unreachable promises. as a fan, i'm very disappointed with cdpr. i did not play this game at launch, but the damage control was insane. it kept me from playing in that state. so, i waited. i had fun but experienced a lot of bugs and glitches like npc's walking through the walls, through the floor, main character falling into the ground... cars glitching out, npc's glitching out. also, something i cannot forgive is bugs and glitches that prevent me from continuing the story. it happened 2 times. i needed to restart the quest. this is unforgivable. this should not be at sale, in my opinion. i know that they patched the heavy bugs, but i still witness it, even after the phantom liberty's dlc. it had its highs and lows. maybe i can give this game another chance in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-16,"i am not finished with you cdpr. i'm so sick of this narrative going around that this game is now good. i remember the countless of videos across social media about cyberpunk being a broken and outdated piece of garbage, and all of sudden we're supposed to forget about that? no matter how many fixes and free content this game got, it doesn't change the fact that this game still has some of the worst ai and physics in video game history. let's also not forget how they said the game runs suprisingly well on ps4xb1 which they never bothered fixing. now, i don't care about any stupid awards but i do care about the influence it has on our games. it's pathetic they won an ongoing award when it doesn't even have multiplayer. and they won it because it took them 3 years to fix a broken game that should've worked at launch? congratulations cdpr, it took you 3 years to make a shed solid on the map, just like it took you 3 delays to shed your reputation as the good guys and solidfy your image as incompetent developers.  cdpr fanboys be like but they deserved an award for adding replayable races, a rideable metro and police car chases oh you mean stuff that was available in gta v at launch. but they added free vehicles, weapons and radio stations yeah, so did gta v at some point. gta v was built on 7th gen hardware and somehow manages to absolutely destroy this game in content, depth, detail, interactivity, ai, physics, vehicle variety, driving mechanics, map design, minigames, literally everything but graphics. on top of that, gta v got director mode, car customization, third person mode, animals, online, like i can literally write a harry potter length book of how much better gta v is than this piece of garbage. despite how much superior gta v is to cp2077, the former gets fortnitecod level of hate while the latter is an internet darling. knowing this, why release a finished playable game at launch when it's underappreciated? and yes, i'm aware of gta v's online broken launch, but it took about 2 weeks to make it playable. i guess 3 years to fix a game is more appreciated. and there's a big difference between an online and offline mode being broken. cdpr didn't even bother with online.  developers are all greedy and lazy. but can i blame them for that? i hate to say this, but there's no point in devs giving us a polished game that is rich in content when a broken game will recieve more praise and awards if it gets fixed soon and adds basic features 3 years later. i blame the fans and journalists. cdpr fanboys compare this socalled comeback to hello games when it's not the same thing. first of all, i don't think think hello games deserves any praise for improving a game when it should've been good at launch. but no man's sky is more deserving of praise than cp2077, because hello games were a small studio that eventually delivered on everything they promised and then some. cp2077 isn't even close to the nextgen experience that was promised, not to mention they only gave us half the game since they tapped out to the multiplayer, another thing they promised. speaking of promises, didn't cdpr claimed that when we buy their games, we are entitled to continous free updates in witcher 3's red note? funny how they stopped with the updates once they won the ongoing award.  as i mentioned earlier, the greedy developers gave up with cp2077 online. you can make fun of ubisoft all you want, but the watch dogs series is better than cp2077 in terms of quality. every wd game has online. it doesn't take ubisoft 3 years to fix a game. as a matter of fact, it took them less to get a watch dogs sequel out. in spite of that, ubisoft is the hated company while cdpr is an internet darling. people praised cdpr for adding onfoot radio did these buffoons not realize wd had that at launch? and it also had a police chase system and a rideable transit at launch. you see what i mean, things are appreciated more if lazy devs add them later in updates rather than at launch. and then you wonder why games are so buggy and unfinished. i don't recommend this trash at all.  p.s. my way or the highway."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-25,cd projekt red truly revived this game since its horrendous release. unforgettable experience with some epic combat and characters. i will remember this game forever.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-25,ive platinumed this game on the playstation 5 and my favorite thing about it was the amount of side content which was really fun to grind. never got repetitive or boring. one of the best games out there.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-24,"the most overhyped aaa game ever. nothing special, just lots of bugs, and broken promises. the game's got absolutely dead world comparing to similar games such as gta5. don't waste you time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-23,threw knifes into innocent peoples face. i really enjoy doing this. would highly recommend recommend
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-22,"tuvo un mal lanzamiento pero ahora es un juego perfecto, muy hermoso es una experiencia unica la que deja cyberpunk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-21,"inann bana oyun gemiten gnmze yle bir deimi ki sonunda oyunun vermek istediini anlamaya baladm. oyundaki buglar dzelmi,yeni donanmlar,eyalar,evre,hikaye,mzikler,mekanikler ayrca oyunda sunulan seenekler eitlilii ok arttrm. oyunun dlcsi kendisinden daha ayrntl ve daha iyi olmasnn yan sra animesi ile ok iyi baar yakalad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-20,"despite some outstanding bugs and wonky physics, cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best rpg's i have ever played. with its beautiful open world to its enthralling story, i am proud to say that i am a fan of cyberpunk 2077 and cdpr as a whole."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-19,"this isn't the game that was released almost 4 years ago. this is cyberpunk 2.13 circa late 2024. it has it's faults and shortcomings, of course it has, but this has to count as easily the best pc game ever made and the all time benchmark for story driven action rpgs. the atmosphere, the artistic direction, with enough scifi intrigue to fill several black mirror series, even the widely slated actioncombat is pretty damn fun. i say best pc game ever, because you do need a decent pc to get the best out of the game and a high tier nvidia card at that, that handles ray tracing and dlss. runs like a dream for me on at 4070ti with rt and dlss 3.0, all settings ultra'd and locked at 100fps at 1440p. amazing experience and never found myself so immersed in a video game for years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-18,"immersive, fun, good characters and a good story. what else could you ever ask for"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-16,good game but disaster debut. as the future bug fixing it became more and more good. the storytelling always be the best part of cdpr. the battle system is really diversity and interesting combination of different styles. no competitor even for now in this type of game. 1 for the debut disaster.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-15,"i'm aware the game had a lot of problems at the beginning but what we're able to play now is a masterpiece. i bought the special edition with phantom liberty and have played over 90 hours already but i believe i still have 3040 hours of gameplay. graphic, story, characters, gameplay, everything is absolutely amazing. just buy it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-14,"it's no secret. this game had it's share of issues upon release, a lot of those were regarding performance issues. i think a good majority of people either a, don't know what goes into making a video game of this proportion, or b, forget that as things do in life, that the process of making those games and what it takes to do it is forever evolving and growing. with that said there were still a plethora of the issues with release that simply didn't need to be issues, shouldn't have been issues, and the devs could have prevented. getting that out of the way, i this game has come a long way. it runs much better, the bugs are far less frequent or non existent period, the changes they implemented thus far to the gameplay have been nothing short of super fun to play and experience, phantom liberty is absolutely amazing... i could go on for hours, but the ultimate synopsis is, if you are a gamer, hardcore, casual, or even if you aren't a gamer, if you are just someone who needs something new to do. you should play this game. the story is captivating in a way that you find yourself addicted and on the verge of finishing it in one sitting. the gameplay is smooth and fluid, although driving and its mechanics as a whole are noticeably and surprisingly inferior to other games especially gta, but it's not a dealbreaker by any means. the world is jaw dropping and its nearly impossible to not be driven to explore every single block in one go. what more do i need to say, go give the game a go!! p.s. i read a statement that driving motorcycles in specific is bad, idk what in the air over there, but as someone who has just short of 300 hours in this game at the time of review, i think i am slightly justified in saying that out of all the vehicles you can drive in the game, motorcycles in general are probably the best and least frustrating by a good margin."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-12,great visuals but poor optimization. good story. stunning world but less interaction. terrible bike handling.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-11,"after several rounds of patch updates, cyberpunk 2077 has shed the issues of its initial release, solidifying its place as one of the standout openworld games. from character design and worldbuilding to gameplay and the progression of main and side quests, the game showcases the pinnacle of the industrys craftsmanship."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-11,"muy buen juego, pero no me ha entusiasmado tanto como gta o red dead, principalmente pq no soy muy fan de los juegos en primera  hacen crear un personaje con todo tipo de detalles para que luego no puedas verlo en accin. le hubiera puesto una nota de 9 si fuese en tercera persona."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-07,"it is the cyberpunk openworld game. lots of controversy surrounding it after they shipped it out unfinished, but they managed to do almost a 180 and deliver what they originally intended. big props for that. the narrative is multifaceted, with largerthanlife, wellrealized characters that you would expect. it's engaging and really ambitious, but stretched too thin and not as good as it could have been. as a rpg, it lacks player choice and agency in the story. it feels onrails in what the player can actually do, which diminishes replayability significantly. they nailed the vibes and the tone of the cyberpunk world. music is very epic and badass. nightcity is one of the most intricate cities in gaming. with lots of thought and detail put into every corner. the gameplay feels good enough but weirdly similar to a far cry reskin it feels shallow it doesn't have much depth, but it does the job. there is a severe lack of player interaction in the environment all you can do is engage in combat or drive to places maybe i'm asking for too much though. i can't shake the feeling that the whole game feels empty and underdeveloped everything is just window dressing to look at the police were broken for the longest time now they're in working condition. i wish the developers delayed the game a few years and delivered a true rpg experience it would have been legendary. it's still very good, but i can't help but feel that it was a bit of a misopportunity. with all that said, as a full package, its still a really impressive showing from cd projekt considering its only their second shot at an open world, and i look forward to their next title. they clearly want to improve and deliver experiences worth playing, and as a narrativefocused videogame, it succeeds in what it sets out to do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-08,"cyberpunk 2077 is a truly phenomenal game that captures the essence of a futuristic dystopia like no other. despite the early challenges it faced, particularly at launch, the game has evolved into a masterpiece of storytelling, worldbuilding, and gameplay that deserves to be celebrated."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-06,best rpg i have ever played 100 times much better now than it was at launch
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-06,"one of the worst games i have ever played in my entire life! i got it on release day and was not able to play the game for at least half a year. crashes, bugs, glitches, bsod etc. then finally i was able to play it and it was the worst gaming experience i have ever had. most boring character design, story is total garbage, world feels empty, music is like made by gen z alpha for gen z alpha, gameplay feels like its from 2010. thousand broken promises like coop, multiplayer, you can enter any building they said. cdpr are bunch of liars. cyberpunk set a new low for video game standards and ruined the gaming market!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-06,"one of my atf games i have ever played. i didn't buy when the game launched, so i missed all of the issues it had. by the time i got my copy, most everything aside from the vehicles had been fixed. this game has an amazing story, and the side content is top tier. every data shard or computer terminal you read has something that ties into the larger game or quest content. it has so many easter eggs, it's silly. the combat is fun an pretty smooth. the progression system is great, especially now that phantom liberty has dropped, and i have replayed the game at least a half dozen times now  every time experiencing something new and exciting. one of the best comeback stories in gaming history!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-05,"beautiful and realistic graphics, addictive gameplay, a plot at the level  movie and of course there is a great actor keanu reeves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-03,"i played it on 2024 with an average pc and it still looked so beautiful. i never really liked the witcher series for dialogue choices before but now i'll try it again.. my only mistake is i didn't wait to have a maximum powered pc to run to.. i'll totally replay this game!! judy i'll see you soon, bye panam."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-03,"le meilleur jeu auquel j'ai pu jouer de ma vie. l'histoire est prenante, les personnes attachants et enfin un jeu o les qutes secondaires ne servent pas  rien."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-03,"initially, i avoided the game due to the backlash it received at launch. after 2.1 patch, i gave it a shot, and, oh boy, im glad i did. the pinnacle of the game is its story, with character design so wellcrafted that you genuinely care about each one. i cant recall encountering such depth in characters in any other game ive played. the citys life feels decent, but it doesnt quite reach the immersion of rdr2 or gta5. the action is really fun, and i love experimenting with different items and builds, though i find this aspect more engaging in elden ring. overall, the game in its current state is absolutely worth it, offering a unique and deep atmosphere. im now purchasing the dlc to see how it all concludes. cdpr, thank you for not giving up and polishing the game to meet expectations."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-02,"this game turned from a huge regret buy into the best game i have ever played. there is currently nothing out right now, that compares gameplay wise, story wise or graphics wise."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-02,"meu top 3, cyberpunk  um jogo com historia excelente, mas que foi marcado por bugs e problemas de desempenho. no fosse isso, seria top 10 jogos de sua dcada20102020. a trilha sonora  boa, poderia contar com a trilha do anime, que  bem melhor, mas no jogo  decente. os personagens so incrveis e as escolhas impactam na histria, o que pra mim  muito bom. amei quase todos os finais, desde os mais tristes aos mais esperanosos, e os personagens secundrios, embora no se comparem a rdr2, so muito bons. amei a jhonny, a panam, a judy, etc. o combate  ok, a histria muito boa, o mundo incrivel, lindo e imersivo. se fosse lanado em 2024, seria um forte candidato ao jogo do ano."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-09-01,"the gameplay is good, the story is also good although a bit short, i like the world and the architecture too. but even after the last update i still feel the game could be better. i wish there were more customization options for the vehicles besides the colors since the game has a lot of cool looking vehicles. the same goes for the cybernetics customization, most of them look the same and basic compared to the npc. not to mention there are a lot of things that were promised but ended up not being in the game, but overall it was still an enjoyable experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-30,"at the time of the game's release, many players were disappointed with it. and quite deservedly so, as the game was objectively unfinished. there were tons of bugs, crashes, and incomplete elements. but it's been nearly 4 years since then, with a lot of patches released, so theoretically, everything should have been fixed. therefore, i recently decided to finally play through the most expensive game in history.overall, the major issues have been resolved, but there are still minor bugs remaining. a few times, the game crashed, animations didnt load, and enemies didnt appear, making some missions impossible to complete.however, the game isnt all that bad. it has many positives, with the main one being the plot! in terms of storytelling, its one of the best games out there. it raises some serious questions about the future, and whether two people can coexist in one  characters even the secondary ones are charismatic. i especially liked keanu reeves' character, whose lines really make the mission come  gameplay wasn't particularly engaging for me, especially the side missions, which often involved simple tasks like fetching items or clearing areas. nevertheless, the game does have some interesting missions that can bring you positive  status of being the most expensive game in history is not entirely justified. the game is quite expansive, with lots of animations and actions. night city is a large city, but you don't really feel its life. you see a lot of npcs just wandering  game also gives the illusion of choice. in terms of choices, it is very far from the witcher. at the start of the game, you choose your character's origin, but this only affects the prologue. after that, your chosen role is used in dialogues that dont impact the outcome. in dialogues, you have various response options, but they dont make a real difference. the actual choice comes right before the final mission when you can decide your character's  summary, if you view this game as a regular aaa project, its quite good. but if you consider it as the most expensive game in history, it can be considered a failure because it was unfinished. had it been released 12 years later, it would have been much better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-30,one of the best comebacks in gaming history. game had a rough start but cd project red really redeemed themselves. hopefully the sequel will be the full vision cdpr had for the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-28,the comeback cdpr made with this phenomenal game is nothing short of a miracle
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-27,"cdpr it's a pity. if cdpr had a clearer plan before developing the game, it would undoubtedly become a groundbreaking game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-27,".when game companies are forced by shareholders to prematurely release games, situations like the first week of cyberpunk 2077's release can occur.poor project management skills, fortunately the quality of the game itself is good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-26,"great game, far from perfect tho short story, some bugs, sometimes it doesnt cause any emotion, but it is a lot of fun indeed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-24,"genuine masterpiece, it had its ups and downs but i experienced only ups, story was incredible, amazing game and one of my favourites for sure."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-21,"my favorite singleplayer game of all time, i currently have an issue with steam so i am giving a 9. however i still love this game, i have 100ed the game 3 times on all life paths, play this masterpiece. also the anime is good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-21,i think this game is awesome! very unique open world experience taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk metropolis with interesting characters and thrilling quests and storylines. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the openworld game genre that wants something new that distinguishes itself from your typical openworld high fantasy titles.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-20,"this narrative took me on an unparalleled emotional journey, with its storytelling and characterdriven focus leaving a profound and lasting impact. this is precisely why we play video gamesto immerse ourselves in powerful stories that resonate on a deep level. cdpr has masterfully crafted a world where we cry with the characters, laugh with them, love as they love, and fight alongside them. their struggles become our own, forging an unforgettable connection between the player and the games characters, world, and environment. finishing that first playthrough is bittersweet because you'll never experience the game the same way again, no matter how much you wish to. all that remains is to drive off into the sunset with some memories and even more scars. well, night citygoodnight and good luck."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-19,gameplay is really really fun and story is decent. but the bugs oh my god. even after all the updates it's still not really tolerable. heard some people that it gets really good with some mods so imma try that out

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-08-17,"i found it to be a very fun game, a little short but quite enjoyable with extensive customization possibilities and a range of very dynamic dialogues. the environment at certain points can feel somewhat empty, a sensation similar to gta, although if you focus on your objective it is quite enjoyable, the story is very good, although it is weak in parts, it is engaging and extremely funny and there was no shortage of laughs, eh"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-26,"glorified boomer shooter that pretends not to be a boomer shooter. a game where you can pet cats, watch tv ads and play arcade cabinets because immersion! realism! but where you don't need to eat. added a few pseudorpg elements to lengthen the stock. too easy even on hard difficulty. nice graphics, story and hidden quotes from various scifi works, but feels like a missed opportunity to make something truly outstanding that would survive through time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-14,"being forced to play other quests so that the one you actually want to play proceeds is no joke. wait until npcname calls you etc. its a terrible design choice in my opinion, frankly. it would have been less of a problem if you could just skip time using in game tools but it doesnt work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-10,"folk, i do not like this game. but this pretension is about the game setting, i dislike cyberpunk as an idea, whereas the developers did their best, and the game itself is pretty qualitative. i recommend the one to all people who like living in this type of being."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-07,"i love this game so much. but there is still some work that needs to be done. on the other side, you can play it on ps4 or pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-05,"simplesmente o jogo da minha vida. primeiro que eu zerei no xbox. por mais que tenha alguns bugs, a sua historia  maravilhosa, juntamente com o mundo que  apresentado."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-29,"i would not say that there exist main story. if it exists it is greatly blurred by side stories because i don't precisely remember what is missions were from main story and what from side quests. the general story in the game is fun and interesting. however, certain side quests were like a splinter that  all the energy out of me. i would say, the rating for story is 910. the world is very well written. however, to know this world you should read a lot of texts in discs that are scattered all around the world. seriously, in the cyberpunk world, do you think player will want to read all these things? the gameplay is the best of all games, i think. i played the game as a terminator which shotguns and miniguns with hacks. it was fun. then, i saw a video where someone is killing someone with bare katana and i wanted to repeat that. then, i saw sandevistine at work. when i got it in the game, it was whole different gameplay for me. now, i took a stance of expert killer, who can kill everyone by one shot to the head in the stealth. and, if things got wrong, i just would use sandevistine and crush everyone! i think, in this game, you can get the best experience in the shooting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-03,"the game itself is very good,one of the best game i ever played, the atmosphere is amazing, the story is good, the gameplay is good except the drive one but damn is the game short, the main story could be rushed in like 5 hours , the game itself is amazing , but so good that the places where its not the best are seen the most,it is amazing but suffers from so many damn flaws"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-02,"genellikle ak dnya oyunlarn severim, cdp red bu iin altndaan ksmen kalkm"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-02,"depois de 160 horas posso afirmar que no geral o jogo  mediano pra mim. motivo?! o jogo  muito limitado, pelo hype que os fs idiotas e a desenvolvedora criaram em cima do jogo era pra ser muito melhor.  impossvel fazer coisinha simples como trocar a cor do carro que  o bsico do bsico em qualquer jogo que contenha carros. o enredo  interessante, mas no passa disso. s no do nota 4 porque a ambientao foi muito bem trabalhada, fora isso no h nada de grande coisa aqui, alm do cyberbug que o jogo foi com o lanamento, os caras fizeram rios de dinheiro, adiaram vrios anos pra lanar um jogo totalmente quebrado, estou quase descendo a minha nota pra 3."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-02,"what else can be said about the game, which is known to everyone who is interested in the topic of composition. i can only say that this game completely replaced reality for me, this rarely happens. and the plot is a story about how to know your own happiness and not die. gorgeous."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-07-01,"when cyberpunk first came out i think we all agree that it was lackluster and was buggy as heck. but i have to give it to cd projekt red they have done an incredible job with fixing it! the extra content and all the bug fixes have made this into one of my favourite games! also the graphics! wow the graphics are breathtaking, i would being giving this game a 10 but unfortunately the main story line it just too short for me! but all the extra content and phantom liberty will have you playing for a long time! i think cd projekt red have show us just maybe some game companies do care about us!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-30,"amei, a histria  muito complexas, as escolhas do jogador durante a campanha tem consequencias bem interessantes, final emocionante, os grficos, cinematics e animaes so lindos. nao teve quase nenhum bug, tirando um encontro q apareceu uns 4 npcs. recomendo muito. ja to querendo jogando novamente."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-26,"preordered for myself and my younger brother. was busy with a contract the past couple years, so only just able to play through recently. completed over a 100 or so hours and just wow. i guess those launch issues must really have been bad because that was a 1010 game. san an, red dead, new vegas. it's up there with the best. incredible writing, can tell so much effort and love when into production. leaves a lasting impression."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,"this game is a masterpiece, i played it on ps4, ps5 and pc. the best version is the pc one 'cause u can put mods on and do wonderfull things. i love this game and i cried many times. i recommend it to anyone who asks me what it's about and what should be done in it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,"if this were a final release version, i would rate it a 6 or 7. and finally, it's a version 2.12 now. everything is decent at the moment, but i hope they reconsider using their current red engine and explore other options. the engine truly showcases cdpr's prowess with rpg elements. nevertheless, when it comes to gameplay, there are noticeable imperfections. this is why i believe they should consider an alternative engine. on a positive note, the story and characters are all uniquely crafted, which is commendable. the graphics set a new standard, as does the sound quality. the only aspect that requires improvement is the smoothness of the gameplay, which they are very close to perfecting. please don't stop the good works!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-25,"i think it really captures the cyberpunk world i envision in my head. i'd like to try other builds, but i'm afraid i'll be overwhelmed by the volume."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-21,the game is fixed. after the 2.0 update this game has finally lived up to it's potential.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-15,"too little, too late. cyberpunk promised much and delivered an enormous amount of content, but very little substance."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-09,"pessoalmente gosto muito desse jogo pela esttica futurista. mas, alm do vis e do carinho  um jogo muito interessante que  o que se prope. um rpg excelente trama interessante, escolhas, um mundo aberto cheio de detalhes, personagens carismticos johnny silverhand aqui  a personificao das ideias do jogo, bom combate e flexvel. no tenho o que dizer sobre os bugs porque joguei aps j terem consertado a maioria deles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-07,"one of the best gaming experiences that i had, even the intro of this game, the so called tutorial had more impact and more deep story telling, then everything ubisoft was releasing for the last 10 years. even if i wasnt a fan of cyberpunk settings, this got me right away!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-07,i play the game in 2023 after all fixed and i can say it's best open world i played in my life
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-03,"amazing story , great rpg mechanics  after the update, one of the best worlds in gaming history with stunning visuals, it's launch may has been a disaster but now it's a certified masterpiece"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-02,"in the beginning the game was a complete crap, with bugs and cheesy graphics, plus  the game was with a broken  editor, and the game was developed for 8 years, started with the development of the game in 2012, for all this time they wasted, and of course in 2020, they release this unfinished game with the dumbest graphics. that's what i understand cd projekt red. the game from the beginning of the launch year  2020 deserves 4 points, and further updates made the game more about the opinion of her normal, although this does not change the fact that cd projekt red with their game did not live up to the expectations of the audience. in 2020, they failed to present this game properly. so the game was raw and buggy, that's basically all my criticism  thank you for your attention."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-06-02,"it's just so peak. amazing story, beautiful and lively city, universal gameplay and combat  fast, aggressive but still hard on higher difficulties. build variations are also worth mentioning, all fun and effective. side quests are pretty fun and well written too not all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-28,cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece openworld rpg. the entertaining momenttomoment gameplay is broken up by interesting storylines and meaningful progression that puts choice in the hands of players. unforgettable and something that everyone should experience!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-27,"review for version 2.1 it s good, good image quality, good performance,no game breaking bugs! let s hope cdpr keeps it this way with their games!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-27,"really great game with good lore, plot, characters, amazing gameplay, using all tools and weapons is interesting and fun. choice in the end was pretty hard and i love it. most disadvantage of this game imho is side quests and characters, world is really huge but empty. also there is a little ammount of good music but anyway atmosphere is good cuz of visual design"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-26,"an absolute masterpiece. unrivalled against anything on the market today. i played it and enjoyed it since  of the enhancements have paid off from a gameplay perspective. one of the biggies is now being able to listen to the radio as you walk around  it really enhances night city. if you are new to playing it, do it a slow pace.  dont rush through the main quest. theres much world building to be experienced through all the details."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-25,"cyberpunk no seu lanamento foi um completo desastre, disso ninguem tem dvidas. mas com os anos passando, a cd projekt red conseguiu se redimir e consertar o que acabou se tornando o maior e melhor rpg deles. grficos incrveis, personagens memorveis ainda mais do que em the witcher 3, uma construo de mundo impecvel, night city  talvez a cidade mais imersiva e mais bem feita dos jogos eletrnicos, e por fim, um storytelling de nvel cinematogrfico, onde me fez verificar cada final possvel para concluir que no existe final feliz em night city"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-25,"i went from being beyond annoyed to thinking its one of the best games i've ever played in my life. i cant think of any other game that had such a glowup like this. you owe yourself to play cyberpunk, its the current pinnacle of graphics and story telling imo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-21,"com um lanamento conturbado, cyberpunk 2077 em 2024  um game incrvel. conta uma boa histria, com personagens impactantes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-17,"this game has changed a lot since it was released. then it was not more than a 310 due the lack of details, bugs and bad gameplay, that's why i gave up and stopped playing. but i decided to give cyberpunk a new chance, and.......... wow! now is a masterpiece. cd projeckt has fixed everything and added a lot of high level details that makes this game memorable. i have spent more than 100h of gameplay and i can say that probably this is one of the top 10 videogames i've ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-13,cyberpunk jest gr wybitn. polecam kademu zagra w to arcydzieo i przey z t gr piekn chwil.  dd
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-11,"a great game with fantastic city, plot and a highly rewarding and customisable combat system. shame about the launch date problems"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-09,"potr avere anche milioni du bug ma night city non si batte un luogo meraviglios,il gioco  bello,pieno di cose da fare ei  sono meravigliosi,grafica magnifica"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-05-02,"tout simplement le meilleur jeu vido auquel jai jou. tout est parfait le gameplay, la musique etc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-28,"absolute masterpiece . the story writing, the dialogues, the characters, the worldbuilding and the gameplay are 1010s. what a turnaround following the disappointing release in 2020, probs to the devs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-26,"my hopes were high, my expectations were high, the price of the game was high and i must say i was stunned when i launched this creation. at the beginning the game decided to cut my hands off and replaced it with implants, but it only made me stronger. then i suddenly had gay sex by an accident i pressed the wrong button and it was literally the moment i fell in love with this ground breaking, industry changing personal computer oriented piece of art. next stop epstein island"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-07,"so, look. yes, the initial 2020 launch was disastrous, and yes, this game  even all patched up  doesnt quite match the promise of a true goanywhere doanything rpg experience. but its become one of my favourite games of all time nonetheless. the story, characters and missions are immensely satisfying. the gameplay loop is addictive, with a balance of gunplay, stealth and loot that captures the best bits of deus ex and borderlands. and night city is a joy to uncover, somewhere between neo tokyo and vice city. the branching paths could be branchier, and the endgame kind of just ends. but this game had me coming back to it again and again. even with all its flaws its a cyberclassic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-22,"the game came out in a bad state but even besides that i found all the quests in the game to be a bit boring, the gameplay wasn't that fun on launch and the romance options we very short lived. i feel like this game could have been amazing but it needed a better writing team."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-17,"up to update 1.6 i was enjoying the game to a point it became my favorite. after update 2.0 all that changed and i find this game really bad  using power weapons requires stamina, sprinting does not d  the only way to increase armor is to add augmentations  before 2.0 you needed gear and you had the option to use transmog if you didnt want to look like a redneck. now clothes are just for cosmetics.  enemies spam grenades and can crit hit you while shooting at you blindly.  after each shot there is a second where you cant do anything, not move nor heal. died a lot times because of not being able to heal. in general, devs should have fixed the broken parts of the game instead of adding new and badly designed features."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-12,"this is the best game. best graphics, best gameplay, best setting, best story. i would buy 100 copies of this just to support the devs! cannot wait for project orion!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-10,"a simple and sweet review from someone who preordered and stuck it out. it was rough, really....really rough, and then it wasnt. its a diamond now and ive never seen a better turn around in my life. if you still havent tried it. try it. if you dont like it. try it again. jk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-09,"cyberpunk 2077 is amazing, if only it had launched like this. after edgerunners, i had to give it another shot, and what a difference. performance is smooth, and while visual bugs still exist cars spawning out of nowhere, npcs acting weird, theyre nothing compared to how the game used to be. the world, characters, and rpg elements are toptier, and most side quests are incredibly well done. the only downsides? too many gigs can feel grindy, and the romance options werent what i hoped for. if youre playing, get phantom liberty before hitting the point of no return, it changes the ending options and is worth experiencing beforehand. if you love choicedriven rpgs and shooters, this is the game for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-08,"they did a great job in 2.0, they fixed gameplay, optimization, npc behavior, bugs and many other little things. after completing the game, i shared the game with friends, when they completed cyberpunk, they asked me why the game is not on an equal footing with other rpg masterpieces. nowadays there are no obvious problems with optimization in games now even on a budget pc you can play cyberpunk. at the same time, even at minimum graphics settings everything looks very good. the game's story is great and keeps you in the role of v all the time. wherever you are, you feel cyberpunk. there is no best or canon ending in the game. the game also has interesting love stories, just like in the witcher. the game is very large, so its impossible to talk about all the gameplay. the gameplay here is not ideal, not balanced. but i cant say that hes bad or not interesting. the game can be played in different styles, but some of them are meaningless or useless. the world of this game is worthy of special attention, even a separate place in the history of gamedev. you can't count how many secrets and references there are in this world. i wont say how beautiful the world is and what a good job the worlds designers have done. this world holds you and does not let you out of the cyberpunk atmosphere even after leaving the game. now i can answer my friends' question. the game had a lot of potential that it didn't fully realize. that is why it stands apart from other rpgs. in addition, its a bit of a shame that we can only play a fullfledged game three years after its release. therefore only 8."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-06,"when the game came out it was super buggy. since then it had developed into a masterpiece, and one of my favorite games. i bought cyberpunk with the intention of using it as a performance check, then refunding it but was pleasantly surprised. my rtx 3050 can run the game on 1440p at 90 frames with dlss and some settings tweaking. i also cant deny the story on this game, within an hour i was hooked and refunding the game hasn't crossed my mind since. i highly recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-06,"story was good and the deliverance was alright. gameplay could be 100x better, hacking was a joke it might as well not be a part of the game. choices we made did not matter one bit. which is sad. not a rpg but a fps story game a good one, even maybe a must play. still doesn't change the fact that its not what it promised to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-05,"the game runs really well and is really fun, i can recommend it to everyone"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-04,"the world worth to live in, engaging stories, fun combat, magnificent environment, and best driving experience with many cool cars."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-04-02,"really good, a very bad launch with a lot of bugs but now it's a real masterpiece, infinitely replayable thanks to modding that make the game even better buy it its really worst"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-30,bad story bad characters only the graphics and some guns good making chaos at city sometimes can be fun but the game is borig

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-25,"this game is honestly amazing. as a story analyst and theorist, the story alone in this game is phenomenal. combined with the amazing lore, the futuristic theme, the amazing characters and gameplay done almost perfectly this checks all the game boxes. the artwork and music is also fantastic. this is my new favourite game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-25,"after much agony and wrongdoing, cdpr was able to fix cyberpunk to become a masterpiece. it is truly money well spent"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-24,"its a good game with good story progression and a lot of sidequests to do, if youre not interested in continuing the main story. sadly its still very bugged in 2024 with disappearing roads, tposing cutscenes and buggy dialog here and there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-22,"magnificent game. the story, characters, gameplay, night city, everything in this game is top notch. gameplaywise it's a pure joy, you can ch oose, alter and combine different fighting styles to play the character you want in an rpgmanner. a stealthhacker, a maniacpsycho, or a little bit of both. hell, you can just take a katana, a bat, or a knife and each of them will offer a unique fighting experience which would affect your battle tactic and style.i adore night city, how it's painstaikingly beuatifull in it's ugliness. miticulously crafted city which feels alive, i dare say the most vibrant city in all of video games. city's characteris vissible everywhere and it's deeply tied with the story. the future we fear the most, almost a distopic one harbours many stories which are all too familiar even in our day of age. people's vengance, friendship, politics, trust and ideals play out in a world with deeply distorted morality, but where some of them still retain the sense of self through connections with others. cyberpunk may be a 2077 dispoianworld, but it's far too familiar for us today, which will often scare you in the playthorugh, and make reconsider something you took for granted, even alter your convictions, and ultimately make a great memory."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-18,"this game is a piece of bug fiesta, with the most childish writing i ever witnessed. the gameplay is slow, the guns don't feel good, the hacking, and all that other stuff is just mediocre, and the driving is so bad like holy hell.... the story is slow, the characters bug a lot, there is always a second of waiting, for a character to finish the sentence so the lift can start and many more like this that ruins the experience of this game. i just got bored of the crawling, then the shooting was just not a good reward. the characters are simple, and honestly pretty boring. i don't know if im gonna keep playing with the game, probably not. overpriced, overhyped, a bug fiesta. thank god i did not pay a single cent for this crap."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-18,"potenzialmente poteva essere un gran gioco. la visuale in prima persona  spesso limitante. tuttoggi il gioco presenta bug. ho battuto un boss solo perch si era incastrato nella colonna. l ai dei nemici  pessima. grafica e colonne sonore sono da capolavoro, per cui mi aspettavo di pi da questo titolo in termini di gameplay e soprattutto odiosissima disposizione tasti per modalit fotografica. in ogni combattimento pi impegnativo vi capiter pi volte di premere, involontariamente, il tasto l3 e nel pieno degli attacchi subiti, bloccandovi di continuo su questa schermata. il mio voto  sufficiente, per limpegno della software house ma, soprattutto perch, ripeto, grafica e musiche sono di altissimo livello."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-18,"i played cyberpunk 2077 when it released and loved it right of the bat the story design and gameplay was really good, i later dropped it until the phantom liberty and 2.0 update and i'm so glad i picked it up again. cyberpunk is definitely one of the best games i've ever played. the chaotic ambiance and the noise and everything going around with the updated skill tree. cdpr has made its way back as one of the best game studios out there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-17,"ce jeu est juste une norme claque motionnelle, quel univers, tout comme la srie ce jeu vaut 100 fois le dtour, surtout avec la version dfinitive et son dlc. bref un jeu qui restera parmi un de mes jeux d'uvre inoubliable grce  son univers faonn de dtails et ses personnages avec une mention spciale  paname  rogue judy alt  sont tous cool... et johnny et ces rpliques inoubliables.. tellement de choses sont  mentionner.. . merci cd project."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-17,"still a disappointment. i categorically refused to play it when it came in 2020. i had expectations for this game and felt kind of betrayed at that time. so i waited 3 years to play it. i thought hopefully naively that in 3 years they could fix it and get closer to what the game was supposed to be. but sadly, even after all that wait, this game still reeks of haste and incompletness. the story main and dlc is meh tier. the character customisation is a joke. the driving is a bad joke. the first person camera is here to hide the shame of broken animation. the romance options are really bad. and put on top of that a lot of details half baked or missing. keanu reeves performance is good, but it didn't save the game. if i can say a positive thing  i liked the atmosphere of the city and the jojo poses in the photo menu 'cause i'm a weeb."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-16,"story is cool but the gameplay isn't in the favor of actually making it equal with enemies and the main character. you can get killed on normal with not many shots or slices but yet you have to use alot more ammo to kill them. when it came to the oda fight, totally unfair not a funfair. he can heal but you can't during combat. can't even take down as some videos ive seen. yea, that is so great. keanu reeves i support but this gameplay. boo wendy boo"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-12,"even though cyberpunk 2077 released in the worst conditions and showed its lack of development, the game was able to redeem itself and prove that in fact it is a masterpiece. night city shines brightly in cyberpunk 2077. this vast openworld rpg immerses players in a meticulously crafted dystopian setting filled with intricacies and perils. from intense shootouts to diverging storylines, cyberpunk delivers an engaging experience that captivates players for extended periods.despite its polished exterior, a few technical issues may detract from the overall experience, particularly on older gaming platforms. nevertheless, cyberpunk 2077 stands as an ambitious game with a wealth of content to offer. by overlooking minor setbacks, players will uncover a world ripe for exploration, a narrative ripe for shaping, and an unforgettable adventure awaiting in night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-08,"um jogo muito bonito e divertido... mas a histria no oferece aquilo que foi prometidoa diversidade gigante de escolhas. so escolhas que claramente no influenciam em nada. a gameplay  divertida, mas tambm peca na diversidade de opes de coisas pra usar."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-07,"extremely depressing story line, empty and boring world, annoying repetitive side quests, and very poor optimization for all the consoles and amd hardware in general  pc version has definitely made with intelnvidia in mind. this is one of the few games which i want to refund my wasted time on it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-07,i like the plot of this  gameplay is also very good.this game is still possible
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-06,"a flawedbut yet one of the best rpgs out there. riding its own lane. dense world in design giant mega and highrise towers, cool highways and alleys and lore fused with social satire akin to that of gta. just hypelibido tinges so many emails spam about  enlargement. taking cues and inspiration from other films and games johnny mnemonic, akira, total recall, blade runner, dredd, strange days etc including keanu reeves and now idris elba who are probably some of the best high tier actors who did great work in the game. taken from the tabletop dd esque cyberpunk by pondsmith. you assume the role of a merc plays as a corpo, streetkid or nomad. each giving unique perks as you evolve in the game. abilities to be upgraded expand its style of gameplay. hack, shoot, slash, stealth and ride. think deus ex meets gta. but there's truly nothing like it out there. its a shame the game launched as it did would probably scored higher if it did . weirdly enough early builds weren't as buggy for me. just had bad ai detection attacking me for no reason. cars spawning like diving whales, jitter car ai crashing into me, reloading from save would cause weird reposition targets in ai. but a lot of it fixed by now. minimal but still easy to findnotice. now with dlss3 support and probably the only the best game to showcase the tech capabilities in its potential. has it redeemed itself? it depends on each individual experience. but i feel in 2024 this game is a must for fans of dystopian futures. love the design of the game. texture work, theres so many scenic views that would inspire artists. the love is there with phantom liberty and edge runners content you should have great hours to swim through of main and side missionsgigs with a decent or surprising great plotline to guide. its really fun ricocheting bullets with a katana hacking enemy optics or overheating them. skipping details of the story. all i can say is please try it. watch edgerunners by trigger studio while you're at it. i'm ready for cyberpunk 2 after the bombastic 91 hours of playthrough. the reality is cp2077 has looming alternative conclusions. there's endings that don't feel all too great. but if you're one to seek out all the details of the lore. it is a deep story. hungry for  blinded for revenge and conclusions. its effective in offering perspective. that is why its nearly a masterpiece . despite some half baked conclusions that never bear fruit and some performance inconsistences. its is a game hard to forget and should be given a chance it deserves as an artform."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-03-01,"the game was a big failure when it was first time launched, but i can assure you after patches and patches and the latest dlc, this game deserves another chance, and i can not stop playing this game. fancy cars, cool weapons, great stories. and exploring the night city, well the combat is a 710. it is supposed to be a big hit if they did not ruin their launch day."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-29,"this game has changed so much since i originally wrote this review and played it in 2020. as buggy and imperfect as that original game was, i still really enjoyed it. the characters in the game are some of the best in the medium and really feel alive. their stories are worth the price of admission alone. however, since coming back to it, almost every aspect of the open world has improved and it feels even better. i feel there are a few missed opportunities in here, but not many, its still a fantastic open world game that mostly delivers on the original promise of this premise outside of the online play which was quickly  early on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-29,this has been one of the best game i've played in years the characters night city's beautiful and dark i love how again the characters feel real and lively and i love judy and her whole story please make cyberpunk2 and keep judy pleaseeeee the game makes me feel whole and happy again from the horrible launch the game had to where it's at now easily my top 3 game of all time

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-24,"great! best graphics in the industry, path tracing with a good hdr monitor is stunning. i really liked the characters. i grew to really like having johnny around, and was invested in the story. many decisions to take and shape your v i really like creating my v i love the separation between aesthetics and equipment, so i can wear whatever i like without stats penalty.shooting is simple, gets better with double jumps, hacks and the sandevistan but could be improved. i completely ignored melee combat, not sure if i did well or not. driving feels nice. quests and companion questlines were nice, but other quests can be ignored.some things feel halfbaked or without much purpose. having a laptop at home, with no major function in it, being able to buy apartments just for the sake of it, the same goes for cars. bad launch!the world could be more immersive, there is not much to do outside missions.question would this have worked better as a third person shooter?overall, really nice game! looking forward to phantom liberty!update 2.0  phantom libertygraphics are even better, no artifacts in path tracing. the dlc is analogous to blood  wine, it really adds a lot. the spy storyplot keeps you interested at all times and is quite mysterious and brutal. the new characters are so cool especially reed. they really have those secret agent vibes one would expect, while keeping them grounded to the cyberpunk reality. the new courier and loot drop mini missions are a welcome addition and invite you to move around the map a bit more than in the original. i even did some of the new gigs in dogtown and they were entertaining. dogtown per se is small but deeper, what i like the  2.0 changes turn the game around. the new skill tree is much better and is interesting to develop. this time i went with a cyberwaremelee build with huge mobility completely opposed to what i did in og except for the sandy and it proved to be much more interesting, i actually enjoyed the gameplay. stats and gear are more straightforward. vehicle combat is a cool addition but rather unused should have been used in a couple missions at least.i was a bit sad to not have another version of the final mission playable to put all my deeply caredfor build to work.overall, cyberpunk is now one of the best games out there, finally!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-20,"it's a very good game with great writing and an immersive open world. even after i finished playing the game, i still wanted to learn more about it and experience the cool atmosphere again. i watched a video about the lore and was looking for a video essay critiquing the game, but all i found was hack youtubers churning out garbage, cliche, and stupid content about the game, haha. it's a shame that it was released amid global outrage over its bugs. i played the 2.0 version and encountered few bugs. i think if they released a polished game back in 2020, there would be more thoughtful content critiquing the game and its fantastic worldbuilding. however, i don't think multinationals can be that powerful, and the fear of multinationals expressed in entertainment products is always exaggerated. of course, there is a lot of corruption and injustice in the world, but people are mostly kind and charitable. there are definitely evil and sociopaths walking around, but they only make up one percent of the population at most. i wouldn't be surprised if the world remained stagnant over the next few decades, but i would be very surprised if the world got worse, because just lifting 10 of africans out of extreme poverty would improve the overall happiness of the world greatly."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-06,this games is so good especially after the updates i didnt play it before but now its totally amazing youneed to try it!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-06,"perfection in one word. i bought the game when it came out and hadn't touched it because of the bugs, but now that everything has been fixed and all the game mechanics skill trees and what not have changed for the better, it's almost perfect. if only it had been launched like that. it certainly would have been better, or at least comparable to rdr2."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-04,"i first played cyberpunk when it came out, i was a pre buy. loved the game but it was blurry and grainy95 of the time. but the story and gameplay were revolutionary and quite forward thinking. dissapointed it wasn't an rpg and you could accumulate property and keep going with new missions and updates. sold the game. recently bought and played again on ps5 instead of ps4. absolutely love it. only first person game i have truly loved since bond goldeneye. they fixed my 3 major issues. 1. grainy and blurry 2. driving was horrible and the mini map. 3. police system. now it's more like gta where you get stars and they come after you but you can hide. game deserves a 2nd chance with everyone."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-03,"this game had redeemed itself with the new dlc and 2.1 update. so much new content and even added the trains people are requesting for. the story of this game is top notch, i would suggest getting the dlc for this game as well since it all comes together and adds a new ending to the game some may not like the ending but the content of dlc is really thrilling"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-03,"the biggest and most graphically impressive cityscape in a game to date. combat can be fun by playing into the games mechanics. but these can sadly also very easily be ignored since enemies act like mindless drones. the concept of the story is interesting and gets carried by generally great voiceacting, apart from the main character that doesn't sound like a real person. driving and vehicle variety is terrible which for me is sadly a big minus for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-02,"best game i played by far, 2024 100 fixed, and at least two hotfixes more are coming."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-02-01,"before the game was released, i told everyone around me that this game will not have the effect you expect, don't get so excited, and in the end i was proven right. the bugs in the open world when it was first released are mindboggling. it should have been released after 23 years. it's a marketing mistake, but that's still advertising, they got more than they deserved."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-31,"really enjoyed it, there were times early on when it seemed a bit slow but the more i played the more i liked it. 2 of the endings left me emotionally drained but they were powerful and after finally playing a 3rd and more happy ending i realised how much the other 2 impacted me and were probably a better ending if a little bleak."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-31,"i think they managed to recover after a terrible start. the graphics, music and story of the game are really beautiful. you enjoy the fights and don't get bored. the worst part is being filmed for driving on a rainy night city night."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-29,"there are so many emotional moments in cyberpunk 2077 that will make your jaw drop as you soak in the beautiful ost and amazing dialogue, mixed with the gorgeous graphics when given the time to render and there are moments of pure badassness when the industrial cyberpunk like vibe starts playing and you get to cause mayhem with your weapons, grenades and cyber habilities. when all of these factors connects, cyberpunk is a masterpiece like no other. even if you're simply driving around night city with the radio off and the rain starts to fall, i promise you, it'll scratch that cyberpunk itch. however i have many issues with the game, first is the rendering, which on the ps4 is extremely upsetting, the city feels dead most of the time, your gun might take a while to appear on your hand, or npcs faces will not be there most of the times or enemies just might take 510 seconds to spawn, depending on how you arrive at the event if you use your car and drives at 200mph, the characters will rend at a very very slowly rate, however night city will remain absolutely beautiful. the interface of the starting menu and in game menu feels incredibly cheap, it's ugly and the level skill tree is too much, although it gives you many options for combat, you won't get to experience all it has to offer anyways, even with 3 complete walkthroughs. the game has its charms but many flaws as well, you need to give it a chance first for cd projekt to give you a glimpse of the greatness they were aiming for. now, years after release, it's a playable game and with its current price, i can absolutely recommend this game even for those with a base ps4. play this game, give it a chance and let its beautiful moments take you all the way to becoming a night city legend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-29,"could be a great game, but when you spend just as much if not more time in the skill tree  weapon tree, as you do actually playing, then it becomes a shy experience. why developers do that dumb st is beyond me. a skill tree reminiscent of ghost of tsushima's is all that's really needed. a weapon tree reminiscent of callisto protocol is all that's really needed. dead space's weapon tree is ok on the more complicated end of that spectrum. st, even robocop's is perfect and he's an actual robot. he doesnt need all that eztra nonsense lol. games where you pick up 1 million guns and each gun has 10,000 versions of it are stupid. i know it's fiction but why would you make a game where a character can hold 75 guns? where do they keep those guns? in their ase? i stopped playing, but i know i would have enjoyed storywise if i made it to the end. there's just too much unnecessary bullt with the skillweapons tree. ruins the whole thing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-26,"ater the lauch of tis game i totaly forgot about it. but i saw this game at steam sales so i bought it. graphicaly it looks good, the main story is ok, side missions were good."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-24,"this is a game words can't really express because there's mainly two types of people. starting with the ones who played it and enjoyed the breathtaking story complimented by the great music and the truly immersive and gorgeous night city. the other side of people contains those who cling on to the past reputation of the game and refuse to really give it a try for what it is, or rather, what it has become after the much needed fixes it has received. now, it's a great time to get into this game since it's very often at half price and bundled with what may be the greatest expansion pack of all time, touching and in my opinion surpassing the likes of blood and wine or hearts of stone, phantom liberty."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-22,"the best game i have ever played.breathtaking story, world, gameplay, music, graphics and characters"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-19,"the game is very good, even though it had a bad reputation because of its release, i had the courage to buy it and have my opinion, and honestly, it became my favorite game, both the game itself and the dlc, due to the mechanics, the graphics , for the characters, references and especially for the story... simply insane"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-19,"a game that i was impatient to play, but given its reputation, i preferred to wait for the various patches which were supposed to make it more stable. i say supposed, because i still had a lot of visual bugs character animations that glitch, objects that float in the air, stamina bar that freezes in the middle of the screen and technical bugs car that stops embedded in the floor and we cannot get out, button to put the exterior view in a vehicle which no longer works, quest dialogue without sound, etc... in short, i am very surprised that almost a year and a half after its release and all the patches that have been delivered are just as laborious. regarding the game itself very immersive, the city life, the characters and the dialogues are great, there is a lot of content and quests that we enjoy doing. unfortunately the main quest ultimately falls short of the rest. i didn't see the end coming, when the credits started i wondered if it was a joke!regarding the term rpg for cyberpunk, we're clearly not into it either. the lines of dialogue leave little choice for the player who would like to complete a quest in different ways. in the end the scenario is prewritten and the player only has control over the end of the game. in the end cyberpunk is closer to a gta open world, lots of side quests than to a real rpg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-16,"having played over 700 hours since the game's release in dec 2020, completing it three times including the dlc, and experimenting with various mods, my hype for this game remains as strong as it was on day one. despite encountering a few issues here and there playing it on steam, the overall experience has been largely positive for some reasons did not face the same issues as many. what draws me most is how the game encapsulates the essence of 'ghost in the shell' and 'the matrix', offering an appealing story with captivating side quest and missions. while it's not perfect, cb2077 comes close to reaching this vision, providing a loaded, immersive experience in night city. i've even dedicated around 50 hours to capturing visuals and creating wallpapers for videos and wallpaper engine, testament to the game's charming environment. one of my hopes for a future cb2044 allowing players to explore a variety of jobs and interact with different characters, not be just one maybe life of medic or something. in summary, love this game  game play 710 sound design  voice acting 810 music 910 visuals and environment 910 story 810"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-16,"i really liked the game and the characters. i have generally found the dialogue with judy, river and johnny to be really decent and even the repetitive gameplay was good. i absolutely  my pants when it came to odas boss fight. literally the most braindead broken boss fight and it ruined the game for me. you have to change the entirety of your play style and perk distribution to make the fight actually bearable. once you die you also have to deal with oda having broken damage on his blades and gun that can shoot around  pillars. absolutely just stupid and im not changing my character or core play style because the developers lack the skills to make a balanced fight that allows all play styles to be used."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-13,"the only 1 bad thing is it's still pretty buggy. everything else is just about perfect, best game of last 78 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-13,"writing this review after the game has crashed for the 1,000th time. you know you've got a real problem when a good gaming session is when you only get 3 crashes an hour. this game has such an interesting world and story that's absolutely ruined by the technical mess that is everything else. cars drive horribly, ai acts horribly, random bugs everywhere, and then of course god help you if you don't want to spend twice as long on the game because you have to replay so much of it due to crashing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-11,ce jeu est tout juste incroyable. quel chef duvre vraiment autant visuellement que lhistoire wow
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-11,"played on patch 1.5 and 2.1 great story, set in an interesting, detailed open world. the game is really fun and definitely up there with interesting missions even the side ones are interesting and meaningful choices. it definitely deserves a spot up there among the great. bug wise, the game has managed to shake its overall buginess. it crashed once during my playthrough on 2.1, and thats fine. however even 3 years after release it has reached the bugfreeness of like a recent assassins creed, so defenitely not bug free. i was hoping for more, especially after all the promises cd projekt made. but hey, still a great game, still 8 points"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-11,"after an undeniable rocky start, cdpr have fulfilled their promises and brought one of the most immersive games of recent years. fantastic narrative design,choices that actually matter, and a city so alive you'll rarely want to use one of the fast travel points. a must play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-15,"when i think of cyberpunk nowadays i have one thing in mind  death. because that's what's cp 2077 for me, a beautiful tale about death. about grieve. being in the lowest point, at the bottom of the depths. i don't care about the gameplay here really, it's a similiar case to witcher 3  decent, but nothing more. what i truly adore is the immersion that the game creates by combining various, ultra detailed animations, beautiful lightning, stunning city and characters that sound and feel real. it's the game that couldn't work without first person mode."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-03,"this game is one of the biggest waste of time in my life, tried it after the hype on internet that ''it is finally playable and actually fun '' but i found out after 20 hours trying to have fun that although it has almost no serious technical problems anymore the game is boring as hell and not promising anything so far and not gonna change until the end, the game is actually a hundred hours long movie that you get bored to death with people talking about things you don't care and you keep skipping to the part where you finally play which lasts 5 minutes to find out its nothing more than driving through lifeless streets and shoot at stupid enemies, then comes the dialogues again , most of the time you follow, talk , get in and out their cars while more needles talks goes on and you beg like come oon game let me try the new gun i found please nooo , no more dialogues , then you give up the story and want to fool around the city but nooo it is too silent ! you can't have fun ! some characters you met during the game phones and texts you and chokes you with needles information about things you have zero interest, its so clear the most interesting parts of the game was clipped because of technical or other issues and what is left is an empty shell , nothing but good graphics and hype, i can't play this game anymore"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-02,"listen, i know what your thinking 1010 is not even realistic for a game. and so much controversy over cyberpunk and it's disastrous release in the early days but hear me out. i came into this game with an open mind, got it during christmas sale with no real expectation, don't tend to play fps type games these days but thought i'd give it a shot. i think i joined the game at the right time just after patch 2.0 with a big overhaul, lots of new content and the removal of any remaining bugs. i was immersed in the game straight away and for the first hour, i was just overwhelmed by the livelihood of the town, i was baffled by the detail that went into creating the various bystanders that walk through night city. the gameplay feels fluid, the rpg element and statistics are interesting and it feels rewarding as you progress through out the game and unlock new features or improve existing ones. i've enjoyed everything from the dark side of roaming the 18 streets at night time to my romance with panam, the campaign is good, the side quests are good fun, you want to race whilst shooting for some money, you can do so, you want to steal cards and get chased you can also do so, you just want to go around killing stuff, that works too.... the sky is your limits. this game deserves better than what it once got, if reviewers were to pick this gem up now and start a review from fresh it would at least get in the 90's......."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2024-01-01,"an unforgettable gaming experience embarking on the odyssey that is cyberpunk 2077 was like stepping into a portal to a world where every neonlit corner held secrets waiting to be uncovered. from the sprawling urban landscapes to the gritty underbelly of night city, cd projekt's magnum opus is nothing short of a technological marvel and a narrative triumph. one of the standout features that makes cyberpunk 2077 an unparalleled experience is its dynamic and everevolving world. the daytonight cycle, coupled with weather changes, adds a layer of realism rarely seen in gaming. it's not just a city it's a living, breathing entity, pulsating with energy and teeming with stories in every nook and cranny. the character customization options are a testament to the game's commitment to player agency. crafting a unique v, my character, felt like an artistic endeavor. the choices extended beyond mere aesthetics, influencing the narrative and shaping the relationships that unfolded. it's a level of personalization that fosters a genuine sense of ownership over the unfolding story. panam, with her unwavering spirit and depth of character, is a shining example of the exceptional writing that defines cyberpunk 2077. the emotional resonance her character brings is a testament to the game's ability to forge genuine connections. as i navigated the complexities of night city alongside panam, i found myself emotionally invested in her journey, an experience that transcends traditional gaming interactions. the intricate web of side quests adds layers to the storytelling, turning what could be mundane tasks into captivating narratives that echo throughout the main storyline. the relationships built with side characters are as rich and rewarding as those with the central figures, creating a tapestry of interconnected tales that enrich the overall experience. exploring the lore and history embedded in cyberpunk 2077 is akin to peeling back the layers of a riveting novel. the attention to detail in worldbuilding extends beyond the main narrative, with books, shards, and conversations providing additional depth to the rich tapestry of night city's lore. despite the initial technical challenges, cd projekt's commitment to the gaming community shines through in the ongoing updates. the patches have not only addressed performance issues but have also introduced additional content, showcasing the studio's dedication to delivering a continually evolving and polished experience. in conclusion, cyberpunk 2077 stands as a testament to the evolution of gaming as an art form. it seamlessly weaves together cuttingedge visuals, a compelling narrative, and immersive gameplay to create an experience that transcends the confines of a traditional video game. as the horizon of night city continues to expand with promised updates and expansions, the legacy of cyberpunk 2077 as a groundbreaking masterpiece is destined to endure in the annals of gaming history. addition it would be remiss to discuss cyberpunk 2077 without acknowledging the tireless efforts of cd projekt. despite the initial challenges and criticisms, they never wavered in their belief in the vision and listening to the community. the ongoing updates and improvements aren't just technical patches they're a testament to their dedication to delivering an experience that lives up to expectations. the transparent communication, attentiveness to the community, and honest acknowledgment of issues have demonstrated that cd projekt isn't just creating games they're fostering a relationship with players. it's this attitude that deserves respect and proves that the studio is not only a developer but also an integral part of the gaming community. in an industry often marked by challenges, cd projekt deserves recognition for their determination to uphold high standards and value the loyalty of players. their commitment has transformed cyberpunk 2077 into more than just a game it's an everevolving journey shared and lived by a community."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-31,"finally played the game after 2.0. i didn't want to touch it until they finished it and i must say it's been a blast so far. the city is beautiful and feels alive. quests and stories are well written, surprising and keep you on your toes. the rpg part is well done, you enjoy building your character and the skill trees are cool. i feel that what's keeping it from being a ten is about the gear and the interactions with the different gangs that you can encounter. the reputation is not linked to what you are doing with them and, yes, they have a different attitude with you based on what you've done with them based on what you decide to do, but it's far from being at the level i would expect and you can't join them or become an important member of some of them if you want. guns and gears could also feel more specific and not just have stats and small effects. i would have hope some gears completely changing the way you build your character. also, some items being locked and inaccessible if you didn't find them like the katana in the prologue feels a bit weird for such an important items. it's ok that your choices lock you out of some items but it's a small issue i have."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-31,"i waited 7 years to play this game, and after its release, i waited another 4 years while cd project fixed it. so after 11 years of wait, i can say, thank you cd project for this unique experience, this game undoubtedly falls into the hall of fame of the gaming rockstars!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-31,"i tired to keep things vague to avoid spoilers but if you absolutely are sensitive to them than dont read this. tldr 2.1 had a bug that corrupted my save file after 80 hours. i started playing around 1.6 and it was okay but left much to be desired. i started again after version 2.1 and i fell in love, and over the past month ive probably sunk 80hours at least into the game my logged time is 190hours but there was a lot of afk screentime in there. im writing this review because my save file is corrupted and will not save past the sneak section at the depot before the big thing happens . when the game begins it just says save file is corrupted and cannot be saved. this is a huge disappointment, up until now i only had 1 crash, very very rare framerate drops, and any bugs were more funny than annoying. i even had one occasion of falling through terrain and rather than break the game i harmlessly respawned back on the point i fell, no dying animation or load screens. still, i cannot recommend this game after going through this s. im so annoyed, i work a fulltime job and i had sunk so much into this game. after 3 years of waiting for a playable game and finally feeling like i got it, this is a massive disappointment. i dont know if ill even fire this game up again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-30,"this game was bad when it was released, but right now is a masterpiece! one of the best games of the generation!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-29,"this is a 2023 review. this game has nothing to do with what came to your minds before september of  is a really nice game now. so to make this clear the game is not bug free. not at all. the graphics are generally really good but the blurness, the stuttering in the gameplay, the terrible display in some of the distanced textures are the consequences of cd projekt red releasing a game with terrible technical flaws, with that occuring to the aforementioned. a very good example is the witcher 3. released in 2015 by the same company and technically it is flawless. now that is the only reason why i won't rate the game a 1010. now about the game itself, it is a mix of doom eternal, watch dogs legion and spiderman 2018. the gameplay and combat is stunning , the story is very good and the characters really goodwritten. now to the point, is it worth giving it a go in 2023? and the answer is yes depending on how much money you'll give and the platform you are to play it in. for example i don't think the 2023 bundle ultimate edition is worth more than 50. you should play it on a highend pc or a ps5. back in early 2022 when i bought the game on ps4 i bought the bundle 3 days ago on pc it was unplayable literally and by all means. might had been running on 20 fps, terrible graphics and uncountable bugs. all these might have been fixed on the ps4 platform but i wouldn't take the risk. although , whether you liked the game or not, whether you payed 60 or 100, whether you played it on 30 fps or 60 fps, we have to give our appreciaton to cd projekt red for not giving up their game and trying to fix it even 3 years after. recommend"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-29,"buggy, for every hour i spent playing the game, i spent 10 minutes googling bug fixes."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-27,"after investing approximately twenty hours in this 'game,' i've barely gotten to play it. instead, i've endured tedious cutscenes featuring unappealing and excessively verbose charactersa surprising disappointment for someone who holds a deep appreciation for old school rpgs. during the occational moments when the game actually allows me to play, i've found the controls to be awkward, and the gunplay fails to captivate. while the graphics boast technical excellence, the aesthetics leave much to be desired."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-27,"2023 review at this point is a great game, impressive graphics, 1010 story and characters, one of the best triple a so far, maybe the second best game out there after rdr2."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-27,"best game i have ever played the storyline, the concept, the atmosphere everything was amazing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-24,"what a wild ride this game has been. initially, when it launched, i mean, it was kinda rough around the edges okay, very rough. but now after this latest dlc and all the patches latest being 2.1 it's like a whole new game. and, man, it's awesome!!! first off, the world of night city is now just so... alive. you walk around, and it feels like you're actually there. the streets, the people, the chaos  it's all so vibrant and detailed. and the dlc? it's like the cherry on top of an already delicious cake. more story, more action, and just more of that cyberpunk vibe we all love. but here's the real kicker  the improvements. the game runs smoother than ever. remember those annoying bugs and glitches? mostly gone. it's like the devs really listened to us and put in the work. the graphics are sharper, the animations are smoother, and the overall gameplay? just chef's kiss. let's bulletpoint this bad boy to break down the cool stuff  stability and performance it's like night and day compared to launch. smooth, fewer bugs, just nice.  richer story with dlc adds depth and more intrigue to an already cool narrative.  graphics and animations crisper, more fluid, and just plain pretty to look at.  improved ai and npc interactions npcs feel more real, and the ai doesn't make you facepalm anymore.  deeper immersion every nook and cranny of night city has something interesting. so, yeah, cyberpunk 2077 has totally turned it around. it's not just a game you play it's a world you get lost in. and if you were hesitant before, now's the time to dive in. trust me, you won't regret it. it's like the devs took all our gripes, tossed them in a blender, and served us a smooth, delicious cyberpunk smoothie. cheers to that!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-22,"a missed opportunity. playing this in late 2023 including phantom liberty dlc. yes the game looks amazing and night city is incredible to explore, but this game is nothing more than an fps gta pretending to be an rpg. your decisions have no consequences as the entire game is on rails, the combat does not reward you for playing in stealth and it is always more fun to use guns. the dialogue is incredibly cringeworthy, to the point where you want to skip most interactions in particiular johnny silverhand  reeves acts well but these lines... my god they are bad  arguably it tries to be witty along the lines of gta5, but fails miserably in its continuous pseudo tough guy writing, that sounds as if it was written by a 15 year old who thinks they are sounding cool. the worst thing about this game is it is in essence not a cyberpunk genre game. cyberpunk as a literary subgenre explores human fears and prospects of dystopian capitalism in the future. none of this is achieved here. the story, whilst potentially interesting, loses focus in that although you are a cyborg with a ticking bomb in your head, you are free to roam night city and spending money on clothing, apartments, cars etc. all whilst none of the story and side quests delve deeper into the definitive aspects of the cyberpunk genre. it is fun for what it is, but ultimately a shame thinking that this could have been an absolute masterpiece if the producers would have had more understanding and clearer vision of what the cyberpunk genre actually is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-21,"cosas positivas de el cyberpunk su rejugabilidad, podes volver a jugar el juego hasta 5 veces para probar distintas clases y en cada una lo vas a disfrutar por su mecanicas de combate y gagdgets que el juego te ofrece. su ambientacion que es el principal apartado y distinguibilidad que nos ofrece un mundodistopico y una ciudad gigante que te carcome la cabeza,no puedes amar la ciudad por que la ciudad e quiere matar es una frase que pega de 10 a lo que es night city. la paleta de colores de el juego tambien es un apartado clave para el juego en donde veremos muchos colores a el estilo neon sobre todo colores como el verdeagua,violeta claro y oscuro, asul fuerte y un celeste brilloso. al ser un juego de rol puede seralgo pesado para los jugadores que no tienen mucha experiencia en este tipo de juegos en donde puedes interactuar con todo y esta lleno de misiones con sus propias historias pero tambien puede ser una hermosa oportunidad para ver si te atraen este tipo de juegos. su historia es de lo mejor en donde se tocan temas como la muerte, la libertad de elegir, el proposito de la vida etcetera. los personajes este punto tambien me parece importante por que los personajes se sienten, el mayor ejemplo es jackie que sin tanto tiempo en la pantalla nos robo el cario a todos y por que no el mismo johnny silverhand que es un narcisita que cree que el fin justifica los medios es un exelente deutergonista y en mi opinion personal el mejor personaje de el juego. lo bueno ni lo malo de cyberpunk su conduccion a dia de hoy creo que la verdad nadie juega e l juego para conducir no es que se malo pero no es su punto fuerte ni de cerca puede llegar a ser un poco tosco en algunos momentos conducir. lo malo de cyberpunk sus bugscreo que a dia de hoy no hace falta ni explicarlo lo que si puedo agregar es que los malditos bugs arruinaron lo que pudo llegar a ser el juego es triste pensar que si el juego hubiera tenido buen lanzamiento probablemente hubiera sido mejor recordado. sus jefes en el juego no hay ni un jefe bueno adam smasher es una decepcion es increible como ese muchacho te lo vendian como que era el mas fuerte el mas mamado y despues es un cyborg mas pero con mas vida es increible como en el anime y el lore de el juego estaba tan roto y llega v de la alcantarilla y se lo culea conclusion final 90100"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-12,"ambitious projects are always a risk. brilliant projects are always a risk. i consider this project unique and a masterpiece. starting from the idea, graphics, drama, and atypical approach to the product, its planning, development, and design. yes, it took a lot of time and effort to stabilize, numerous bug fixes in critical conditions. in general, an early release that at one time had to be urgently removed from stores and put in order. but all this is already in the past. today there are some problems with optimization on ps5 played on it and quite a big difference between the performance version and graphics. with an emphasis on graphics, there is a significant graphics slowdown. this is a great game that i spent 170 hours playing, completed the phantom liberty dlc, and all the playthroughs. looking forward to the continuation!thanks to the cdpr team for their tremendous work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-11,"bought it some months ago, but only really started playing lately. even with all these updates that i haven't really felt yet the game is just dull. characters are cardboard cutouts. voiceacting is meh. animations and movements are laughable. looks so stiff. for a game of this scope, proper motion cap would have been more appropriate. gunplay is mediocre at best. uiux is totally fine, control overall is good. also, 2005 called, it wants its driving gameplay back. the atmosphere is there, the world is detailed and all. but even with all that it just isn't special. it is better than most games and if it was some small studio, this would be 8 easily, maybe even 9. but cdprojectred isn't a small studio, and the price tag is high, plus they promised a lot of stuff they didn't deliver on release. looking at this in regards to what cdpr had in mind, as their vision, this doesn't deliver fully. 710 isn't a bad game. it doesn't mean this game isn't recommendable. it still is a good game, it is still fun, but it does not deliver what i think it should do. it doesn't feel like, still, the completed vision."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,"had a rocky start, but it showed how much the developers cared to put in effort to revive the game and make it playable. other games like call of duty should be taking notes from this, instead of focusing on releasing ingame content, focusing on improving the game is much more important. cyberpunk really proved that a game can go from a 0 to maybe a 10"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-10,tried game after 3 years and all i can say about is cdpr made a huge contribution to improvement the game. gorgeous gameplay in every way.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-09,"this is the most enjoyment i've had in a game in quite a few years. cd projekt red did some heinous , back when they released 1.0  but now, at 2.02.1 as of writing this, they have once again proved why they are a top tier game developer. against all odds. normally i would'nt forgive stuff like this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-08,"it was never a bad game, but the early bugs and crashes made it frustrating. but after the edgerunners patch 1.6 they were going to create a new world, what has been finished at the release of the phantom liberty patch 2.0 dlc. one of the best game ever and the best ongoing game in 2023. worth to try it for everyone."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-06,"cyberpunk is my favourite game ever with also a amazing anime. cyberpunk have an amazing story my personal favourite story and an amazing rpg gameplay one of the problems that i had with cyberpunk was the easy boss fights but with 2.1 they buffed many bosses also the game have amazing graphics and is one of the best open world games ever created, its in one of the best cities to play night city. the game had a bad launch with many things that cdpr promised that didn't got added also with alot of bugs, but now they have redeemed themselves alot of bugs fixies and alot more content and make the game like they promised after almost 3 years with also phantom liberty dlc with almost 5m sales in 2 months i think it's just perfect in the current state even without a online"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-06,"my experience with cyberpunk 2077 has undeniably reshaped my perception of video games and how i consume them. the game immerses us in a ruthless, lawless world where we are the sole entity capable of navigating through the chaos. just when one might think the game is turning into a typical action title with stunning graphics, a time bomb is implanted in our heads, ready to explode at any moment. this constant threat urges us to seize every opportunity virtual life presents, fully aware that the story can only end badly, as the game unapologetically embraces its dark nature.without delving into the optimization aspect  my highperformance pc i93070 faced issues at the game's launch  we are now at patch 2.1, and the gaming experience has significantly  gratitude extends solely to the developers, setting aside managers and investors."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-04,"what can i say cyberpunk 2077 had a rough start still i loved the game from the start, it was a almost perfect game for meyes it had many bugs and the optimization was not the best still it delivered a memorable experience the story telling was one of the best that i every played. the music, characters, setting all of that was just so perfect for me and with the update 2.0 cyberpunk 2077 is we're it belongswith the addition of the phantom liberty dlc cyberpunk got even better. again did cdpr something we thought would be impossible they delivered a dlc that has so much hearth into it, i go so far that i would say phantom liberty is on one level with the witcher 3 dlcs. the characters are all memorable and you can really feel with them especially with so mi, the music is just perfect the setting they got again everything on point. personally for me cyberpunk  phantom liberty is one of the best games of the last decadei clap for cdpr they did a fantastic job cyberpunk will be one of the games that you will play and remember even decades later like elder scrolls ect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-03,"so i originally got cyberpunk on my xbox one x back in 2020. at the time of launch as we all know the game was buggy. i put it on the back burner as there were tons of other games at the time. fast forward to the launch of 2.0 and phantom liberty i decided to go all in and return to the world of cyberpunk. i was honestly blown away with how good this game looks, the quality of writing, and the improved combat. this game is absolutely amazing and its really sad that it launched in the state it did. if they waited and launched it now with phantom liberty included this game would have been goty no doubt. i cant recommend this game enough and highly recommend giving it another chance. this game is an experience you cannot get anywhere else. for me personally its not very often a game can immerse me to the level cyberpunk has. thank you to the developers for sticking with this game and creating an unforgettable experience. hopefully with the sequel they dont give in to corporate pressure and truly release it when its ready."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-12-03,"i played cyberpunk without expecting anything, thinking the game would be a 7 out of 10 and i bought it on sale just for the futuristic aesthetics that i'm in love  when i finished the game i fell in love with the universe.a perfect story with very few bugs, this game was a surprise for me and that's why i give it 10"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-16,"definitely recommend. especially after 2.0. probably one of the most disappointing launches for a game in a while. but after waiting fo for cd projekt red to fix the big gamebreaking bugs and improve performance and put out the 2.0 update, this game feels more like the game they promised. the story is great with solid emotional beats, interesting characters, twists and turns, and decisions that actually felt like they kind of  combat is solid and improved after 2.0 update, feeling more impactful with the new perk and skill trees. there are plenty of customization options and interesting quest lines for your character to venture into. new perk and skill trees system help with diversifying play styles and builds melee combat still . the cop system improved, but still . they spawn in randomly and are incredibly easy to lose."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-15,"el juego lo compr recin sacado. el lanzamiento fue un desastre, lleno de bugs y mal rendimiento. me lo he pasado al 100 en 2023 con el parche 2.0. y el juego ahora s es lo que prometan. una pasada. recomendado si o si. juegazo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,"cyberpunk 2077, version 2.02, is not a bad game at all, but the worst part is its technical condition at the moment, and it's been 3 years since release. and i'm not saying about release version, no. only about current state. but it's playable and has really fun combat. so, yes, it's alive, nevertheless still buggy, which can ruin your experience. different annoying bugs are countless and they are everywhere, little and big ones. game also still crashes from time to time. the more you play, the more often you face old and new technical problems. and it's hard to believe that all this will be fixed. especially after statements that there will be no more major patches after 2.1 version. quests and activities are mostly average and repeating. the same is with dialogs, most of which you want to skip almost entirely. just read the log of the mission, complete it, move on, and that's all. the open world doesn't feel alive and it's no more than just an empty shell. but this game shines from time to time. so if all written above doesn't stop you from playing cyberpunk 2077 and you don't feel like this is some new sort of an early access, than you can actually have fun with it. for example, combat is satisfying and you have different ways how to fight or sneak your way through opponents. and battles are core of gameplay. this game also has great graphics and not the worst optimization. some story moments are also not of the lowest quality. soundtrack is really nice! and the game keeps you in maybe until you become too tired of technical issues or of taking all the same quests and repeating everything all over again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-14,"if you want a quick review, 2.0dlc is one of the games you should be playing in 2023. if you're a fan of the cyberpunk edgerunners anime, you should buy it. if you are a cdpr game fan, you should play it. anyway, panam and aurore and judy are best girl!!! goro is best boomer"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-11,"i have played cyberpunk just after the world premiere, and i've made another attempt when i got phantom liberty. the game is now what it meant to be. it is masterclass storytellingactionopen world mix with plenty of scifi implementations. there is a ton of weapons to choose, every car is different in driving and i have to say now driving is so much fun! has no comparisson to the early game misunderstanding. now riding around night city could be a game itself. i strongly reccomend playing the game for the first time or if u've played it before the updates. a must for scificyberpunk lovers!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-11-10,"following the multiple controversies surrounding cyberpunk 2077, i decided not to purchase it at launch. the game's seemingly incomplete state and the actions of the developers cdpr left a lot to be desired. now, many years later, the game has finally reached version 2.0, and so it was that i reluctantly gave this game a shot. ultimately my conclusion was that cyberpunk 2077 is pretty middle of the road. it's still glitchy, and it's not that satisfying to play, but it's functional and has good visual and sound design. if you were to ask me to recommend an open world fps rpg, i wouldn't pick this. i'd pick fallout new vegas."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-23,playing the 2.0 version with the phantom liberty dlc makes this game a truly epic experience. fantastic story with some of the best side characters ever written.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-23,"cyberpunk is an exceptional game. after playing it with the 2.01 patch, i can confidently say it stands out as one of the best games, perhaps even the best game of this decade so far. the gameplay is highly enjoyable, especially due to the wide range of builds with various weapons and abilities. it's practically impossible not to have fun. the storyline is incredibly engaging and one of its standout features is its nonlinearity. you have a multitude of different endings and many missions can lead to various outcomes, all influenced by the choices you make from the beginning. what i appreciate most are the characters, particularly panam and johnny, who are simply amazing. the city and overall quality of the game are breathtaking . one aspect that still troubles me is the ai iq, as npcs and opponents sometimes don't make sense. however, aside from that, everything else about the game is phenomenal. as for my favorite endings, i have a soft spot for the secret ending and imo the best ending the star especially if you've built a romantic relationship with panam and selected the nomad lifepath. i rate it a 10 rather than a 9 because, in my opinion, this game is simply too much of a masterpiece to classify it as a 9. typically i refrain from awarding games a perfect 10 out of 10 because that implies perfection with no to almost no room for improvement. however, giving cyberpunk a 9 just feels even more wrong."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,"redux review wow this game has improved so much since i played last. for context i played the game on release and then again mid 2022, and though the game improved a lot in that time, it is nothing to the improvements they have made in the recent 2.0 update of the game. of course on release the game was practically unplayable, which has since of course been fixed. there are still some funny bugs of course it's a huge open world game, but i didn't receive one gamebreaking one during my most recent playthrough. the one good thing i could say about the game on release is that i thought the story was very good and this game probably has the best characterization and dialogue in an open world game. that of course still persists, but the gameplay has been completely revamped. to name all the changes they've made in the most recent update would take forever. but the gameplay is so much better this time around. this game is now up there with my favorite open world rpgs. but i will not forget the state the game was in on release, and the lies that were told before release. this will always be a lingering feeling while playing this game, which keeps it in my opinion from the best of the best. 410 2020  710 2022  910 now"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,"it has been some time now since the complicated release of this game. yes be ready to have a rocket of a pc to run this game as well as it deserves to be run, but man it's worth the bargain. i loved the game since it's release, yeah the mechanics are not the greatest when it comes to driving or even combat some times but it's good enough, and really great sometimes. the story, characters and the visual make up for it 300. be ready to go for a ride with this game because it's a hell of nice one. i said it around 4 years ago and say it again, i'll be long before we see that much details and such a fine and well crafted video game universe in term of graphics and art."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,esta bien ahora.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,"cyberpunk may possibly be the best game i have ever played. i am v, a merc, giving zero  while i roam nc. the dlc phantom liberty is great as well, the more content, the better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-15,i don't know what to say. i really don't. what an experience. what a story. what a trip. what a city! the only reason i can't give it a 10 is because the driving is kinda iffy. before i thought keanu was the best in john wick. but damn now i can't imagine him as other than jhonny silverhand. he smashed it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-13,"previous thoughts cyberpunk 2077 needs less is more. it's brimming with potential, beauty, and a city of layered moral philosophy and cybernetic deliciousness, but there's too little control. for a game announced almost a decade ago, it comes fairly close to unforgivable in just how short it comes up in comparison to promises made. still, with patience, there's a thrilling and thoughtful experience that lays decent foundations for future stories. updated thoughts cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update is a muchappreciated apology from cd projekt red and, hopefully, a lesson with real ramifications on future expectations and processes. it doesn't mean forgiveness given 2077 on release was near unplayable, but it does inspire some goodwill for future entries. that said, 2.0 is a whopper of an update that streamlines the experience and clears the majority of the buggy detritus so the player can focus on the multitudes of fun cyberpunk has to offer. clear upgrade paths allow for insane levels of customisation that can be retooled at will for whatever the player fancies whenever the feeling strikes. night city is as delicious as it is deadly and, with a smoother adventure in place, allows the game's fantastic narrative to truly shine. i ran through the game again before beginning phantom liberty and seriously enjoyed myself. there are still bugs and glitches, but the final product now is so polished that the developer deserves props for not taking the easy way out and running with the initial sales money. red dedicated themselves to bringing cyberpunk as close to their original vision as possible and, costs aside, did a great justice for their players."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-13,"as it stands in 2023 cyberpunk 2.0 and phantom liberty is now one of the greatest open world games ever created. the gameplay is much improved and extremely fun, the story is epic, the bugs are infrequent and the game world is a gorgeous and well optimised marvel to look at. cd projekt red have finally built the game that they had always intended. if you were on the fence before you owe yourself time to buy this and try it. ps near the end of the game i decided to walk to the last mission from the outskirts...a task that took 30mins with no sprinting. i took in the world as i went. people get hung up rushing to mission goals but this game i regularly paused to take in the atmosphere something i just never do in other games. even after 100 hours moments like were more frequent than you would believe. i'm glad i gave this game another chance."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-13,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-12,"the game is actually very enjoyable and nice after the patch 2.0. a few interesting bugs still remain and the ai is still acting like under 90 iq most of the times, but the game deserves a solid 8."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-12,one of the worse games ever made! cdpr are hacks and adam kicinski should be fired for this abomination .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,"it might have been a rocky release, and beleve me i'd go to poland and scream slurs in front of cdpr's hq if i had the chance, but that still doesn't change the fact that they pulled it back with the best dlc i've ever seen in any game and also an experience that i didn't get from any other releases in the past 10 god damn years. this game is an artpiece and i dicourage you from agreeing with anyone that says it's not. also people, no, a 1050 can't play this, and before you start complaining, go play hogwartz and tell me how it goes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,masterpiece.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,"never in my life have i played a more immersive and complete game.this game has everything that an open world game can have. activities, a relly great story, a world that is by far the best open world created ever, music, gameplay... it's just a whole package of peak game design."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,"even after the 2.0 update this game is still a buggy mess, and to make it worse the game requires a beefy pc to run it. do not recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,"i had very few issues just a few weeks after launch. i enjoyed it for 70 hours. it was missing features i would've liked, so it didn't quite live up to the promises."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-11,"gioco uscito con milioni di bugs ma molto divertente trama ottima,caratteristiche npg ottime belle le lovestory ottimo il finale"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-10,"i realy enjoyed the game and love the setting. i played right after release, sure i had some buggs but it was fully playable. i just feel sorry for the people who tryed to play on last gen but even more so for all the developer who put in the hard work. for me it is the best game in the last 510 years. therefore i have spent more then 100 hours in night city sofar so far, the dlc makes it even better!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-10,"i played on premiere on ps4 and despite bugs and low fps i loved the game  plot, characters, gameplay, all. now after 2.0 update this game is amazing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-10,i think that even the initial release was a technical failure the story is one of the best futuristic city stories i played. the idea of narrator silverhand is something i have never seen before.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,"version 2.0 excellent game. i loves the story, the duality of the character is genious, sadly, cant have a real expansion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,version 2.0 excellent game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,"bumpy road for this gmae, but since phantom liberty, redeem is complete."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,"the game was a disaster at the beginning, that's an understatement. but now it's one of the best games available today. cd red can make games, they just made a mistake at the beginning."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-09,it maybe has a bad start but it owner know how to fix it i love it when it first release and now i love it more when phantom liberty release.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,it's unlike anything else  its ambition shadowed by nothing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,cyberpunk is one of the only games i've ever played that had good side quests. i wish the main story was fleshed out a little more though.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"thought i'd give it another try with the 2.0 update but the game is still buggy and unpolished. npcs and cars still fade in out of nowhere or spawn next to you. npc models are repeated. i still see groups of three of the same npc talking, all with the same repeated voicelines. story events keep glitching out and characters will momentarily float, pause unnaturally or outright tpose for some time. shame they won't let me refund this garbage. the one thing the game does well is the world designers behind night city. that's it. sadly the driving is still terrible so exploring feels awful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-02,this game makes starfield look like .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-08,"a masterpiece of game, story, gameplay, characters, scenary everything is incredible now! this game is next level"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,the dlc is incredible
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-07,fantastic game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-17,"could be a good game if it didn't have a lot of bugs and crashes, release experience was awful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-05,"with the update to 2.0 and the phantom liberty expansion adding a new storyline that is so cinematic it feels like it stands on its own we could realize without some of the initial bugs and the problematic launch on oldgen consoles that the backbones and structure of the original game were strong enough to carry the game and the world it tried to build. perhaps the fact that starfield released just before this and gave us all a very direct comparison to another open world rpg game was a blessing in disguise. it highlighted what good characters and storylines can be and what a living world can feel like. add to all of that the fact that nvidia used this game to showcase their new dlss 3.5 and path tracing technology where even a 4060ti like the one i have can run the game at over 100fps and have it look like a dream makes a lot of other games look flat in comparison. the game had its issues and just as any game of this scope will have issues, i played it at launch on an xbox one s and even then with all the glitches and underpowered hardware i was able to enjoy the story and setting. now with how far the game has come it is just impossibly to deny the fact that cyberpunk 2077 has become one of the best games out there currently. one that will stand the test of time as a classic and a pioneer, hopefully inspiring developers to put as much effort into their worlds with architecture, design, music, product design, car design, weapon design, and coherency as cdpr has done. i can't do anything but place this game in my top 3 of all time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-05,"perfect game with perfect expansion. one of the best games in the world. please, play it and then come back. you will thank me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-26,can't think any better cyberpunk game will be in next 10 years
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-04,"i loved this game from the start, but now it is even better than ever. cdpr, despite the flaws, is one of the best developers out there and their attention to detail is second to none."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,kinda short 20 hour game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,the recent 2.0 update brings this game up to a solid 910  if you are into narrative driven rpgs then this is a must play
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,"original game was a 7.58. update 2.0 and phantom liberty dlc are a bless for this game. like in the witcher 3, cd project is able to create a world that engages you. the 2.0 update should be the original verison of the game years ago. the main storyline is very interesting, the side quests are many and almost all of them very well structured and some with a very intriguing plot. they are not ubisoft missions. the problem was cd project's marketing strategy for this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-03,"as of patch 2.0 what was good they ruined contracts locked behind the grindwall, not like it was on release hacking and stealth hacking especially now are useless, they completely ruined systems that do nothing to newly buffed sponge bosses aiming is not screen centred, but character centred, you do not feel in control of your v when aiming so, in a nutshell, the developer wants us to go down the sole route of stuffing enemies with cyber lead well done cdpr and with all of that you got godlike story, really touching, really keanu, really reeves i mean it. the story is a masterpiece, it's philosophal, deep, even though really short and jackie, since they cut out the part when you become v, you don't get used to jackie, so he doesn't matter to you in the slightest, he is an empty shell, sadly performance is really good even on my system with rx580 and full hd, i play on high with fsr with around 50 fps, which is good so why did they feel compelled to ruin what worked and not add what was necessary? the answer is that sheeple will still gob that down and not understand the story in the slightest"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-01,"if this game had worked upon release, it would be in the goat conversation. now that it does work, this is the de facto scifi game that holds weight with the best books and movies."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-10-01,"definitely not up to the crushing expectations of it's release, but nonetheless an incredible rpg with good sidemissions, captivating story, and surprisingly responsive melee combat, which is unique for today's calibre of rpg. beware of bugs, inconsistent difficulty and poor pacing at some times."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,"fun, fun, fun, i just wish there was more expansions coming after phantom because i really want to play more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,"so cyberpunk 2077 2. update came online a few days ago, and before that update, i would have recommended the game, but now i won't. see, the 2.0 update is hugely focused on making the gameplay faster, smoother, more mobile and so on... i have no issue with players running and dashing around while pounding or shooting like maniacs, but i enjoy a more slow paced stealth gameplay. when the game initially launched, i tried a bunch of things but came to enjoy the stealth hacking gameplay a lot. going around undetected and taking down gangsters with hacks really pleased me and i was fully intent on doing just that again on the 2.0 update. sadly cdpr didn't see it in the same light. for them it was fast pace or nothing. so they heavily nerfed the fun of that gameplay until it was barely a thing anymore. now you can't hack without getting discovered until level 20. you can't hack fast because your ram doesn't allow it so you spend a lot of time just afk waiting for your ressource to fill back. if you want to be stealthy, you are forced into some very specific hacks or you are traced and found fast. and the only way to get a functionning build is around level 30 using a bug exploit with specific cyberware that you absolutely need. congrats cdpr you killed the fun of a build because you found it too strong in a frickin solo game. so if you like stealth and hacking like me, don't play this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,after patch 2.0 the game is a masterpiece! finally we got the game we all wanted!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,"the game started like  in terms of gameplay, but i think something we all can confirm is that the story is gold, after more of 10 years we didnt got an original story like this, everygame story seems like its a decoration because new games focus more on gameplay than indepth, but gameplay of cyberpunk got fixed, a story commonly made in series and movies due how hard it is to make in game is completely playable and more, cdprojekt did well into doing a series and sponsor the game after all these reviews, they are an expression of redemption which made a dlc when the company itself is commonly against"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-30,"in progress i bought cp77 phisical when it launched phisical map included, at that time i completed half of the act 1 but stopped playing due the technical problems, but when it was working it was a piece of art. now i came back for 2.0 update, 3 years later... started a new campaign, i was kind of bored in the parts i was replaying but glad it runned very well... now that im in almost  i can say this is a visual masterpiece, dont spect to be killing people most of the time! this is a movie that would be very hard to emitate in a theather. the only downside its that i feel they downgraded the graphical departament for ps5, but still looks for the time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,"nach 2.0 nur noch schlecht. ich wnschte wirklich ich knnte mein lieblingsspiel noch spielen, aber ihr habt es mir fr immer weggenommen. sehr schade, bin nicht mal bis zum addon gekommen, der skillbaum allein ruiniert alles, kein interesse auch nur irgendeinen punkt zu verteilen."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,"you didn't even need to install a mod to make the game enjoyable with version 2.0, so get it and have fun with it. it's almost like the game has been relaunched with all of the issues and glitches fixed. on top of that, if you've seen edgerunners, i'd say the game will feel two times better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,played this on ps4 and hated it the bugs the low poly characters and constant crashes made me walk away from my most anticipated game well since 1.63 lot has been fixed and 2.0 absolutely makes the game 10x better now that im on pc im addicted to the combat one of the best games out there as of today.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-29,"at launch i would have given this game around a 410due to there being several glitches and bugs. still to this day people see cyberpunk launch as a comparison point how badly a games state is. i had really lost my faith in cdpr and started seeing them as another company who lost their passion for good games and cared about money more then releasing good products. how ever coming back to this game after the 2.0 update has proven their commitment to the game. before i didn't care about v because i knew nothing about himher. they have added a prologue before the game and you can choose which 1 suits you. corpo, streetkid and nomad. its a decent chunk of gameplay and makes your character feel way more developed, allowing me to appreciate the rest of the game more. there is a ton of new dialogue fleshing out characters and missions, the combat has been reworked feeling overall more balanced and enjoyable. the new skill trees are much better. my fps is completely stable and never spikes plus i haven't changed any components in my pc since last playing the game. night city now has loads more going on and stuff to do. they also finally added police similar to gta but in my opinion they are better and more threatening if you get the higher wanted levels which i highly recommend trying out. apparently they are working on 3rd person but cdpr is yet to confirm. i really hope they do this and make it feel just as enjoyable and not an afterthought. the game feels completely finished and i feel like if it released in this state then more people would have looked past on what they didn't deliver. i am still disappointed that dialogue choices still don't mean much. you can approach certain missions in different ways but this doesn't change anything outside of that mission. i really do hope cdpr have got another night city entry in the pipeline now they have something to work off. i feel like they could really knock it out the park and deliver on their original image of night city. if you haven't played cyberpunk in a while or at all then highly recommend giving it a shot. its easily earned a seat at the table with the other quality games and i commend cdpr committing to this game and getting it to a point where it can proudly sit on their portfolio. its restored my faith in this company and i believe in future they will release games in completed state. i hope that thought ages well."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,"in short with 2.0 update and dlc cyberpunk 2077 go from a 45 game to a 25 game the game has received some changes with the 2.0 update and dlc, which unfortunately greatly disrupt the fun of the game, which is a shame because i really enjoy playing cyberpunk. on the one hand, there are no more grenadesand maxdocs to buy, which means you only have 2 of both and have to wait for a new time, estimated at around 40 seconds, which can make the game very difficult in some situations and thus turns the fun you should have with the game into work please patch it back to the old system so it's a lot less fun now. a change that i don't like either, but it's not that bad, is the change to the ncpd's siren, which now sounds like a container ship signal that's about to break."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-28,"one of my alltime favorite games. incredible design. different ways  character builds to play the game effectively. i love the story, yet some quests are little bit too dark for me. very smooth game mechanics  fights. the city and its surroundings looks amazing. driving mechanics could be better  to improve it, use the controller for driving and mouse  wasd for walking the world. great modding community. if you love the cyberpunk words just like me, this is a must have."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,"this has been a lovehate game for me, but cdpr's efforts have made me love it more and  game is not perfect, it has a lot of issues even after 2.0. but with the effort cdpr has shown so far, i'm sure they will make this game even better than it is now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-27,"i enjoy this game a lot, mind you i played when this game released... we should hold accountable cdpr's lies and the decitful marketing. it's at his core, especially before the update a dressed up early access but here we are three years after to play the actual game they probably would have wanted to release. i love this game but i also need to remind people that we should not let the company get away with it even after a no man sky level redemtion."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-24,what a comback!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-23,life changing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-23,"i played this game on day one and it was bad but not that bad for me at least, after 2.0 i played a couple of hours now and i can say the game is now complete finally, waiting for the expansion, but overall this game is now one of my favs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-23,"preordered but had an unplayable bug on day one, finished it 3 years later now. still buggy but playable. the city is gorgeous. msq is okay, combat is boring and repetitive. overall definitely a good game that was worth the time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-23,after the 2.0 update the game is now a solid 9. one of the best open world shooters i've played in a long time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-22,"while it's got npcs and police that function better and of course better graphics but graphics aren't everything and tiny details may sway somes opinion but shouldn't as story, gameplay and if it is complimented to it, interesting world to explore and characters and there development. but the story is a boring mess with plot holes like why did arasaka make a copy of the person giving them the most trouble. the story being about two unlikeable  characters that want to be a legend like what does that even mean. keep a chip that's supposed to be kept cold in there hot ass heads like what? also a villain that doesn't chase protagonist rest of the game and doesn't show that there any kinda threat both to the city and player. still fake rpg dialogue though skill tree fixed this games world rewards and exploration are just as boring. where are flying cars without mods or bringing someone back to your apartment and so on. even taking stuff or stealing has no effect on people and still boring shops also 3rd person needed not just while riding vehicles. i just found that fixing it's problems of glitches and so on just more revealing of its many other problems and it doesn't do anything original or new to stand out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-22,"a imerso de night city  a narrativa faz esse jogo ser especial, uma pena seu lanamento ter sido to prematuro, mas a empresa mostrou o compromisso com os consumidores e fez sua parte."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-22,"depuis la sortie de cette 2.0 le jeu rempli enfin mes attentes, bon boulot cdpr !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-22,"still one of the worst rpg ever released. the 2.0 update finally added dlss support but unless you have top end state of the art 4000 card... it will send your fps plummiting by over 30 fps from earlier version. and yes... i did update the nvidida driver on my 3080ti and is playing most optimal settings according to nvidia. plenty of bugs all over the map npcs falling through elevators, still horrible car mechanics, gunplay still bland and just boring  and while some find it pretty... it's still a boxy mess of stuff that simply doesn't make for a good game. the rpg changes in 2.0 make the game worse in many ways. half the npcs shooting at you no longer even have guns dropping. gameplay is simply lacking and maybe... just maybe... i will bother to do a full playthrough of the game in 2077  when modders have fixed the rest of this  ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-22,"another overhype. played the game 23 months ago liked it and moved on. but this mfers hyped the game again bro theres no change. games ultra easy, items are overpowered and broken. why do we fanboying this game? overpromised pile of garbage"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-22,fun

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-20,"good story, great gameplay but the replayability still going like 2010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-20,"great graphics, like the dark tone of the story. one of the few games that i actually enjoy the side quests."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-20,"nonostante i bug del giorno 0, ormai corretti,  fantastico, doppiaggio da paura e missioni per tutti i gusti! la storia un po' scontata ma merita comunque il vostro tempo!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-20,"vulgar, stupid, linear and bugged. the witcher 3 was far far better"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-18,big potential
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-18,the world cdpr have created breathtaking. i play it since the release and wont stop soon.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-18,performance  your game will crash very couple of hours. little bugs here  there those are whatever. reason for the low score is how unfinished  rushed the game feels. if you play the game these things will make themselves known. roleplaying is nonexistent. and for the most part missions are phoned in. if the game goes on sale 100 buy it. i  my copy for 25 dont regret it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-17,absolutely amazing game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-17,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-17,the game was a disaster on console at launch. having picked up the pc version i was immediately amazed and absorbed by night city. the plot is perhaps a little disappointing but it is one of the few games that led me to finish all the side missions and collectibles. i'm waiting for the dlc to increase the rating! i hope....

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-16,"an incredibly immersive rpg that doesn't ever quite live up to its sky high expectations. released in a very horrible and buggy state, the game has become much more the original vision promised. the city and the world are the main star here. the story, while having its moments, was very uninteresting to me and i saw myself starting to tune out at the end. still a really game that just could have been so much more. official score 8.810"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-16,"graphics are insane and the ost too, specially if you like rockmetal. the story is great, it is nothing spectacular but it can hook up many of us. personally, i love this game since day one besides bugs and crashes. however, the game has improved a lot since those days, so now with the 2.0 update, it'll be the best momentfor new players to try cyberpunk or even for old players to give the second chance that it deserves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,after updates one od the best games. cant wait for dlc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,"found visual fidelity quite poor overall, considering how much technology is in this game. frequent issues while playing. found the story of minimal interest, and obviously not very much to do in the game outside of that. expected much more based of reviews i had read."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,since fixing all the bugs this game is definitely a 1510 now. amazing game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,"impresionante ambientacin, es un buen juego de accin y como rpg bastante aceptable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,"didn't touch the game in release so im playing it in 2023, it's incredible immersive, the history is good and everything feels smoth in the combat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-15,"i love rpg games and in my opinion this is one of the best games of this genre. i value character development in games, even more so if it is a wellmade system. when i see the cyberpunk skill tree, it warms my heart how much the game gives you the opportunity to go your own way and the freedom to choose the order in which you acquire new skills. good but short plot. interesting and numerous side missions. interesting weapons with very good detail. the possibilities we have as v are many. a new apartment, better cars, a change of appearance due to the wardrobe, different fighting styles, romances and so on. phantom liberty is coming out soon and i think the game's rating will be raised."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-17,"en mi opinin, es realmente un muy buen juego. entiendo algunas crticas negativas le falta retoquescorrecciones en la ia, bugs visuales, ms interaccin con la ciudad... pero en general, es un juego muy disfrutable con una ambientacin muy buena, muy cyberpunk, personajes muy buenos, misiones secundarias increbles, la historia principal es muy buena, la capacidad de que tomando decisiones personajes dependan de ti al nivel de que mueran incluso y la jugabilidad es disfrutableentretenida."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-10,"yea it took some patches, but this game runs so well now. the game itself is absolutely spectacular. one of my favorites of all time for sure. amazing characters, atmosphere, world, gameplay, graphics, and dialogue."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-10,"yes, cyberpunk needs a few patches, but its a great rpg, with an awesome atmosphere, cool characters an deep and thrilling storytelling!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-09,"the game was stunningly beautiful, and the graphics were incredibly impressive. i was immediately taken in by the gritty, noirinspired atmosphere of the sprawling city of night city. everywhere you looked there was something new to take in from the neon lights of the bustling city streets, to the dense shadows of alleyways, to the sprawling skyline and towering . the attention to detail was mesmerizing and i couldn't wait to explore. i was taken in by the deep, engaging story that took place in this brutal world. i was eager to pick my path and see where the story could take me. the characters i met were dynamic and interesting, and the choices i made had real consequences."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-09,"yeah, the release wasn't it. but now  patch 2.0 and phantom liberty, cyberpunk has become the game most of us wanted when it was shown. just an awesome experience with minor bugs. that's all!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-08,"characteristic characters, city, story, and gameplay all done brilliantly. this game is 2x better than rd2 and 7x better than starfield"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-08,"perfect video game, cdpr has done a great job on it, maybe rockstar games can learn something or two from them. it's funny how the console players rate the pc game, the gaming community has become pathetic"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-08,"it has several strengths, but it still falls short of being called a great game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-08,"best story of all time, no game evokes so many different emotions. this is something incredible cd project red made the best story, wrote great music, made great quests, made a beautiful city. game 1010"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-07,"even though cyberpunk 2077 had a horrible release, cd projekt red worked hard on the game and created a masterpiece in many ways. this game lets you be whoever you want, good guy? bad guy? you decide who you become in night city. cyberpunk 2077 doesn't fail to have you invested in story which takes place in a breathtaking environment, while playing a badass music on the background. one of my favorite games of all time!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-06,"it took 2 years but it is fixed now, memorable story, great gameplay, and the best writing i've experience in many years"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-06,"more than 100 hours in cyberpunk 2077. while definitely there is space to improve, it is still one of the best rpg on the market."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-05,"jogo foi lanado incompleto, cheio de bug. entretanto foi refinado com o tempo e hoje  um jogo bem slido, tendo uma misso que apesar de linear, muito interessante. assim como, outras aspectos inovadores como a qualidade grfica e as expresses dos personagens."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-04,i didnt experience any off the bugs or horrible things ive seen online in two play throughs on my series x. so the game was just as i expected it to be. awesome!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-03,"i played it on the release day, 400 hours in and im still playing it to this day. it's my absolute favourite game of all time, and nothing probably will top this game for me. this game has a special place in my heart even though it has some flaws which i accepted from the premiere. in addition cyberpunk 2077 is very mod friendly which let me to make the game even better in my own ways. plus the update 2.0 and the phantom liberty expansion will make the game basically 3 times better. this game changed me, thank you cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-03,"solo decir que no me importan las puntuaciones y las notas solo disfrutar los juegos porque cada uno tiene su opinin personal y es respetable pero solo por este juego he decidido hacerme una cuenta y puntuar. una completa vergenza de juego desde su lanzamiento, y que a da de hoy siga tan mal con todo lo que iba a ser me deja sin palabras la verdad. no sirve no para estar en una vitrina de coleccion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"while night city might not let you become anyone you wish, it remains my top pick from recent gaming releases. i dabble with new games now and then, but i always find myself returning to those neonlit streets of night city, hunting down oddballs for a handful of eddys"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-12,"game is easily 1010, one of the best games i have ever played. fantastic story and night city is amazing city. really looking forward comming back to it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-02,"today, it's have been fixed a lot. it's not perfect , world have a lot of issue and there is a lot of midding feature. but the quests are really cool and the atmosphere is just perfect...."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-02,"honestly i am dead tired at the moment as i stayed up until 1 am finishing this game, but boy was it worth it. most of the bugs have been smoothed, and the only time i crashed was because my drivers were not up to date. the atmosphere is amazing, and honestly i am just going to stop now because i could praise this game all night, but i think that it is time i go to sleep."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-01,"best game city and atmosphere out there. graphics and atmosphere 1010. game is not the best in all ways, but in some ways, usually artistically, sociological and culturally, architectonically, it's best thing ever made"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-01,"the game is very much enjoyed. even more so in 2023. it is true that it came out defectively, but luckily that has already been fixed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-09-01,"literally, it's a fun game .there's a lot to do . very beautiful open world"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-31,"a huge step in gaming history ! great storytelling, amazing graphics. very good gameplay !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-31,"i loved the main storyline, but i would have loved it more if all the fake promises hadn't been made to us, regardless the game was fun on pc, and performance was a huge issue, but somehow dlss carried my system to the ending and the world very details yet mostly inaccessible, but its a must play game tbh."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-31,"loved the story, tried different endings, wish the city was more alive, cops not dumb and bosses more entertaining"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-30,"cyberpunk 2077 day 1 is an amazing game! the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is smooth, and the story is compelling. i loved the amount of customization and the way the choices made in the game actually affected it. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves scifi or roleplaying games. it's definitely one of the best games i've ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-28,this game is still bugged. sound problems popping very often and graphics glitches.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-28,"i loved the theme and the story. the characters were memorable. a few bugs with animations, but nothing that ruined the game for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-26,"simplesmente esse  meu jogo favorito, conheci cyberpunk em janeiro de 2023 e tive umas das melhores experincias de video game nos meus ltimos anos. virei f de tudo que cyberpunk tem a oferecer e estou ansioso para expanso dlc que vai sair em setembro"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-26,"awesome game, the story is nice, the open world is gorgeous and immersive, the characters and their development is top in most cases. most side quests are also pretty good and dont feel too lame, you can even get nice rewards like cars or some good guns. on pc you can even add some mods to make the game even better and you can customize even more how you play. only thing i am not the biggest fan of is the restriction for romances 2 for male, 2 for female. to play it a good pc is definitely needed but thats okay for what you get with this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-26,"i actually had a blast playing it. they've fixed things up pretty good now, at least for me. i am really excited for the phantom liberty dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-23,this is definitively a really great game. don't listen to console huggers complaining about it because of their potato machines can't handle the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-20,one of the best games i ever played you'll get the vibe definitely and you can figure out how much time they spend for details of story masterpiece
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-20,"actualmente, en 2023, el juego funciona estupendamente. la historia es simple pero entretenida, te mantiene enganchado pero no es algo increble. la personalizacin de personaje es extensa pero no tanto como pensaba, todas las modificaciones que puedes comprar o encontrar hacen que el estilo de juego sea diferente en cada rom que juegas, lo que no me ha gustado es que a pesar de ser un rpg en el cual tus decisiones cuentan, no cuentan tanto como yo pensaba, s es verdad que depende la decisin va a tener ms o menos peso en la historia pero me imagin que tendra todo muchsimo peso, ah fallo mo por pensar lo que no es. en definitiva, un juego que merece la pena probar si te gusta el mundo cyberpunk, los rpg, personajes secundarios carismticos y la creacind e objetos"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-20,"cyberpunk 2077 would have been flawless if not for some minor ai problems, glitches that aren't invalidating or too few interaction with night city"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-20,"it's now a game with technical issues fixed and it's in good shape, but it's never going to live up to what was promised before its release, and that's a sad fact. anime they released can't change that fact."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-19,"score 810 cyberpunk 2077 has undergone a significant transformation since its launch. initially, my review might have barely reached a 5, given the technical issues. yet, with continuous fixes, updates, and an upcoming expansion from cdpr, this game has evolved into one of my favorites. its engaging story, excellent combat mechanics, and skill tree contribute to its appeal. regrettably, some aspects like police encounters and scripted car chases remain lacking, and the fact i can't fully forgive the state it launched in. however these are minor in comparison to the now fantastic game it has ultimately become."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-18,"excelente, la verdad maravillosa con el juego, espero unasegunda parte con ansias"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-18,kedindimi v gibi hissettim. bir rol yapma oyununun en byk amac da budur zaten. ara sra fos dklkleri ve kk hatalar aldm. o nedenle 1 puan kryorum.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-18,very good game. i enjoyed playing this game a lot. i strongly recommend this.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-16,you would not wanna miss this  just mind blowing . at first i was hesitating to try it but my experience was by far the best i have ever experienced in video games. graphics 1010 story 1010 gameplay 910 experience 1010
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-16,"enjoyed it, although i was expecting this to be more of a rpg. story is really engaging and touching."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-16,cyberpunk 2077 never shapes a lively night city world at all! feeling betrayed as the game is far away from the media propaganda.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-15,"no vou precisar falar tanto, o lanamento do jogo no pc fala por si s. prometeram um real madrid, entregaram um xv de piracicaba. ok, tiveram os hotfixes e o jogo ficou jogvel desde ento, mas ainda assim deixa muito a desejar quando se lembra a grande promessa e hype que foi. misses so muito repetitivas, a dirigibilidade dos veculos no teclado  uma porcaria e a policia  incrivelmente avassaladora, srio, eles brotam no cho se voc faz qualquer coisa. diria hoje que o jogo no  ruim, mas longe de ser o que se espera."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-15,"basically no choices in main plot.  which ends in my case idiotic way and is not allowing you to continue game after main plot ending, you can only use save from just before point of no return.  i was focused on main plot because this is what it is suggesting  you have to hurry most of the time and ended it in seven hours... i'm very dissapointed after all witchers plots that were brilliant and all this marketing, hype etc  and because of that lack of choice i started to see all those glitches and bugs in game tons of those and sometimes they affect feeling of the game drastically."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-15,"i'm glad i've played it after long time from release. one of the most immersive games ever, i hope phantom liberty will do the game justice"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-14,"nice game. i really enjoy some of the characters i knew while playing, but most of the side content is kinda repetitive and lazy. i'm really hopeful for phantom liberty, although it would be nice if they gave this dlc for those who, like me, bought this back in the day at the full price and didn't ask for refund i only managed to play cyberpunk 2077 two whole years after the release. it was horrid at launch. anyway, i think it is worth to play nowadays, especially if you appreciate the cyberpunk genre."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-14,"this is the best game. there is best characters. panam, vic, jackie, v all this characters very good and deep. love this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-14,"good game great visuals and good story, if quite short and the side quests don't really hit hard like the witcher"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-14,"this is yet another game i jumped onto way after release. the state this game was released in was unforgivable and the failure to live up to the promises they made was horrible. however, i really like this game. this is a game that just hit the right aesthetic, gameplay, and story for me. it is not phenomenal, the game does have low points. if i could rate it without knowing the state it was released in and the promises they failed to live up to, this game would be a 910. something about my little ape brain just loved the concept and main question that the game posed. there are better games, but this one is a personal favorite of mine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-13,"i really like this game. when the game was first released, people called it a work in progress. i can't comment on that. because when i played the game, it had been on sale for quite some time, and when i played it, i hardly saw any bugs. i really like this game, and i also like the anime. i hope everyone can play it happily."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-13,just a great game with great graphics and the best videogame world to ever exist. the bugs that were really annoying at the launch are all gone and the rest of the game is just a really great experience and a must play
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-12,"this game is literally one of the best i ever played. the script is great and uncommon, the characters are unique."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-11,"it's great game with amazing graphics, characters, music, combat, absolutely bonkers giant city to explore, it's so complex and fun and engrossing! i can't wait for more content!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-09,"cyberpunk 2077 transported me to a neonsoaked future that's both mesmerizing and gritty. the detail in night city is jawdropping. while i cherish memories from past cd projekt red titles, this game stands out with its unique atmosphere and deep narrative. however, a part of me did long for the camaraderie akin to the witcher series. nevertheless, roaming the streets of night city is an experience i won't soon forget."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-08,i have really enjoyed the game. its a masterpiece in terms of storytelling. the game looks beautiful. i like that each weapon gives an unique feel. performance wise i've got around 60fps using dlss on high 4kdlss balance on rtx 2080.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,"i don't usually write reviews, but this game is disappearing. cyberpunk is a masterpiece, but frankly a masterpiece is not for everyone. it's scary to think about what kind of workers encountered the first players who played on the release initiative, even if there are so many bugs in the game now. in addition, there are moments that the game lacks elaborate details the city is beautiful, but half the streets are empty and lifeless, it is touched upon that there are not enough details in terms of changing weapons, transport which occurs as cardboard boxes, food and drinks are just garbage in inventory that slowly restores health and stamina. in general, in fact, the game has only two drawbacks low quality of optimization and rawness in small things, but the game fully pays for itself with pluses incredibly bright, charismatic characters that are interesting to watch, memorable and interesting side quests, just a fantastic plot that really catches to the depths of your soul seriously, the story will really touch you to the core, in each character you will find something close and familiar, the incredible atmosphere and mood of the game as a whole, beautiful and picturesque locations, a dynamic and interesting combat system that can be customized for any passing style and simply gorgeous music! if you ever want to think that you did something wrong in this life  listen to the cyberpunk soundtrack. if you accept the technical shortcomings of the game, it will reward you with such vivid emotions and impressions that not every book or film is capable of, and even, perhaps, help you sort out personal problems. initially i wanted to give the game 8 out of 10, but the music, characters and plot confidently pull the game out for all 10 out of 10. i highly recommend playing it. p.s. and there is also a bed scene with a girl of model appearance from the face of keanu reeves. if there was a dlc with this scene, but on behalf , i would buy it 3"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-07,"great game. had some issues on the start, but not that crucial as it was described in the internet. plot is great, best implementation of living actor into the game. night city is beautiful, great cyberpunk setting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-08-06,played it after getting a free coupon on gog games a year after launch. i initially played it on ps4 on launch and had to return the game for a full refund.i believe that cdpr has redeemed themselves and cyberpunk 2077 is now a masterpiece. the story line is engaging and the gameplay is enjoyable. i am looking forward to the dlc.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-26,"this game was an incredibly dull experience, especially for an aaa title. it felt like a futuristic version of far cry set in a lifeless city. the characters lacked depth and failed to engage me. the dialogues were irritating, and i found no interest in interacting with the game world. the forced romance with one of the female characters was incredibly cringeworthy. the behavior and speech of the adult characters resembled that of immature teenagers. what disappointed me the most was that the game was marketed as an rpg, but the leveling system was unimaginative and lackluster, adding no real value to the overall experience. the dialogue options seemed meaningless, as they often led to the same outcomes, leaving little room for meaningful choices. additionally, the variety of guns offered in the game felt almost identical, with insignificant differences. the only redeeming quality was the impressive graphics, featuring stunning visuals that may appeal to casual gamers who enjoy flashy lights and superficial elements, like the appearance of sexy npcs and famous personalities like keanu reeves. however, if you consider yourself a serious gamer, i strongly advise avoiding this disappointing game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-19,i believe that cyberpunk 2077 was the best or one of the best game in 2020. it's one of the most immersive games i've ever played. the relationships between the main characters are all top notch and their personality were striking. then i loved going across night city because nc is a very beautiful and lively city. finally the number of choices available to me blew my mind. 1010 game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-18,"cyberpunk 2077 is a very immersive game and the game is actually not that bad if you meet the recommended system requirements. personally i find that the storyline is very interesting and engaging, with the exception of some characters that are truly boring. characters will accompany you throughout the whole story and that makes it very fun to know whats next. minor bugs here and there but the game is really quite enjoyable if you can look past all these minute problems. 810 my cyberpunk 2077 experience at december 2021 was quite special as i had been hearing about this hyped up video game for a long time and have wanted to play it for awhile. this game is best explored when you do every possible side quest possible as they really add a narrative presence to the story"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-16,"update 072023 so 2.5 years later i'm returning to this game. my oppinion has changed and i think i was overreacting a little bit back then. there was a lot of frustration going on as you can tell from the text i wrote back then. it wasn't a fair rating of the game. this game is still not the masterpiece i was expecting when it was released but it is a good game. i think after the fantastic the witcher 3 my expectations were skyhigh, maybe too high. i was expecting another masterpiece and cyberpunk just wasn't what i was hoping for. it's understandable that cd project red wanted to try something new instead of making another witcher game. this is such a massive project that it is almost doomed to fail. so given that i think they did a pretty good job with cyberpunk 2077. you can also tell that they tried to improve this game with the recent patches and updates without rewriting the whole game. rating 710 original 122020 this game is a mess. the press aswell as cdpr lied to us for months. this games is nowhere near to living up to the hype that was created. it starts of okay and you are waiting for it to finally pick up the pace and become a great game but it never happens. the world is huge but it's basically empty. 90 of the sidemissions are the same boring stuff again and again. go there kiil someone, go there pick up something and so on. where are the great sidemission with a good background story we are used to from witcher 3 ? the are some missions with an actual story but the are very rare. dialogues all boil down to the same answer one way or the other. you can't answer good,bad or crazy. you are forced to answer one kind of way. where are the choices ?the whole game feels rushed and incomplete in every aspect. the mainstory is okay but nothing great and just when you think it finally get's better the game tells you that you are close to finishing it. it has a ton of bugs and glitches that are still not fixed although most of them are not gamebreaking. the world is big but there's not a lot to do except following the main mission and do copypaste sidemissions again and again. it doesn't feel rewarding at all. to me johnny is a very annoying character and he sure doesn't help the game. keanue reeves was a bad choice for this game. he's very limited as a movie actor and he's very limited in this game aswell. all the patches wont make a great game out of this one. too many things are fundamentally wrong with it. there are some upsides to this game aswell the world is big and looks good, there's a ton of loot, and you can chose between different perks. graphics are great, especially the characters and their faces. overall it's just a big disappointment. i've been playing videogames for 30 years and this game is the biggest letdown in the last 20 years of my gaming career. rating 410"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-16,"the first thing i did was to wait. for the obviously unfinished product to be patched to a playable level. many minions bought it straight away, gave bad reviews and cried about how you could publish an unfinished game and yes, it is true, one should not publish unfinished games. but in times of alpha and beta publishing on steam in disguise of free beta players, anything is possible nowadays. after several major patches i bought and played the game after roughly 6 months and i thoroughly enjoyed it. it might obviously not live up to the standards of the initial commercials which raised expectations towards infinity, but now, it is a very enjoyable game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-15,"an amazingly good game. i've played for 250 hours, it still feels the same. a really great game, you should play it, and you must play it today!!!!!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-12,"cyberpunk 2077  a personal journey through night city as an old dinosaur in the world of computer games, my enthusiasm had waned over the years, and i hadn't truly enjoyed a game since the days of command and conquer red alert 2. however, in december 2020, everything changed when i built a new pc and decided it was time to put my graphics card to the test. it was pure luck that cyberpunk 2077 happened to be the game i chose, and little did i know that i was about to embark on a thrilling and unforgettable journey. from the moment i launched the game, i was immediately captivated by the world of night city. the graphics were stunning, and the attention to detail was breathtaking. as i wandered the neonlit streets, towering , and bustling districts, i felt like i had stepped into a futuristic dystopia unlike anything i had ever experienced before. the immersion was incredible, and i was instantly hooked. but it wasn't just the visuals that drew me in it was the story that truly blew me away. cyberpunk 2077 presented a narrative that delved deep into thoughtprovoking themes of technology, societal struggle, and the essence of humanity itself. the characters i encountered were richly developed, each with their own unique stories and motivations. i found myself emotionally invested in their journeys, making every decision and interaction all the more meaningful. what amazed me the most was the freedom of choice i had throughout the game. cyberpunk 2077 offered a level of agency that i had never experienced before. whether i wanted to approach a mission with stealth, hack my way through security systems, or unleash pure brute force, the game accommodated my playstyle. this flexibility allowed me to truly shape my own version of v and witness the consequences of my actions, creating a sense of ownership over the story that was truly exhilarating. reflecting on my time with cyberpunk 2077, i can't help but recall the countless memorable moments i encountered. from intense gunfights in dimly lit alleyways to highspeed chases through the city's sprawling highways, each gameplay element was finely crafted to deliver excitement and adrenaline. the game kept me on the edge of my seat, eager to uncover every hidden secret and explore every nook and cranny of night city's sprawling expanse. it's important to acknowledge the technical issues that plagued the game upon its release. like many others, i encountered performance problems and frustrating bugs that hindered the initial experience. however, i have to commend cd projekt red for their dedication and swift action in addressing these issues. the patches and updates that followed significantly improved the game's stability and overall performance, allowing me to enjoy cyberpunk 2077 in all its glory. in conclusion, cyberpunk 2077 revitalized my love for computer games in a way i never thought possible. it took me on a personal journey through night city, reigniting my passion for immersive storytelling and captivating gameplay. from a chance encounter with the game as a graphics card test to becoming completely engrossed in its gripping narrative, cyberpunk 2077 delivered an experience that will forever hold a special place in my gaming memories. chatgpt helped me put this into words, its exactly how i felt though"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-11,"overall, as of 2023 great game. interesting plot with great lore, though 3rd act felt rushed and honestly was asking for more story content. great side quests when it comes to unique npcs judy's, panam's and river's quest lines in some aspects are better than main quests, which themselves are great. fixer's quests though are boring and repetitive, just come to a location, kill up all the mobs, loot and that's it, to be fair game provides a great variety of ways how this can be done, and in many instances, it is possible to complete the gig completely in stealth, but honestly it is just preferable to get to the building, destroy everyone in 2 minutes in fastpaced action and be over with it. the great combat system really enjoyed both the melee combat, ranged combat and net running. art direction, music and design are some of the best i saw in video games in general. buggs are still there and they still can be quite annoying for example in johnny's side quests line."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-11,"initially i put 1 out of 10 as this game was trash at launch. despite that, after a year or so the game was playable. should i say that it has on of the best stories, characters and music? i think now this game deserves a shot. i played it like 70 hours and waiting for the dlc! p.s i still listen to cyberpunk's ost almost every week. it's really atmospheric!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-07-02,"johnny, i don't have much time to write this review... openworld exploration and side gigs if you liked the anime and the idea of exploring night city sounds appealing to you, i'm happy to announce that this is where most of my 64 hours of playtime comes from. the radio station called body heat plays a song from the anime sometimes, which is great for immersion. cleaning up the city's cyberpsycho problem to that music was the most enjoyable part of the game for me. but that's just a side gig, and my thoughts of the anime were doing much of the heavylifting. beyond that, the openworld can be a fun waste of time. nothing too breathtaking, even if the game can be quite pretty. it'll keep you occupied for a good amount of time, and if that sounds solid enough to you, you could probably stop reading this review and buy the game while it's on sale and before i ruin it for you. main story about 20 good, i'd say. i'll keep it quick as i'm dying. jackie good. vik good. takemura good. johnny has a couple of good moments but his entire concept becomes annoying long before the end and harms the pacing. that's pretty much it. the rest of the game is filled with biochip malfunction cutscenes where you're forced to fall to the ground and cough up blood and then argue with johnny. there are also like 10 different stoic female characters that all act in a similar unlikeable manner. the writing largely consists of crass language, drugs, violence, betrayals, deaths, and a shallow corpo bad message that is never expanded on and merely shoved down your throat at every opportunity. whether or not you agree with this message isn't the point corpo bad isn't some novel take. you need to do something with it. we were getting somewhere with takemura for a bit, but he didn't get enough screen time. the point is that the plot almost never makes you think. it doesn't make your brain dance. this is fine early on, as you figure more things will happen later, but no, that's the whole game. choices don't matter, your playstyle doesn't matter, it all leads to the same outcome. compared to deus ex, the main story of this game is a joke with no subtlety, even if i enjoyed a solid 20 of it. gameplay so, get this. i tried playing this game the way you'd normally be encouraged to play most immersive sims deus ex, dishonored, meaning i took the stealthy pacifist approach. i also played on hard. well, that was a mistake, because cdpr thinks difficulty equals making everything a bullet sponge. how are you going to design a stealth game where enemies are bullet spongy? that doesn't work. if you don't take out your enemies in one shot, they alert everyone. two shots can work if no one sees them, but it still feels like you alerted everyone since the combat music kicks in if they survive the first shot. the game also forces you into nonstealth encounters much more often than i'd like, so if you're trying to be a lightweight spy, good luck with that. it's plainly obvious that they didn't intend for this game to be played all the way like this, even though the developers claimed to be huge deus ex fans and one of the skill trees is entirely dedicated to stealth. that didn't stop me from trying though. my first priority, after paying back my debt to vik, was to find a silenced pistol that would be strong enough to take out enemies in 1 headshot during stealth. the most adequate pistol type i found for this task was the neue, but i had to find one with sockets so that i could slap a pax mod on it, which renders its bullets nonlethal for my soughtafter playstyle. after many hours of completing side gigs to increase my stealth damage skills and going to every shop in the game trying to stock up on damage mods, i finally had my weapon of choice, which i still had to remember to upgrade as i gained levels. now, you might be thinking that having to do all that just to have a usable stealth gun in a stealth game is bad design, and you'd be right! but it was an emergent goal i set for myself and it made me explore the open world, so i didn't mind too much. just be aware that even if you bruteforce ironic your way into playing as a stealthy pacifist like this, you're still going to despise the bulletspongy boss battles even after grinding, at least on hard. i wasn't built tanky, and i avoided body augmentations because in any welldesigned firstperson stealth rpg, i shouldn't need heavy armor or super fancy body tech if i'm sneaky and clever enough. but this game doesn't work like that. my damage outside of stealth didn't scale very well even with a powerful revolver, because most of my points were into stealth and hacking. since i had no armor and no damage, i had to blind every boss constantly by using flashbangs and various quickhacks, and unload comical amounts of rounds into them. 5000 characters limit. more there httpswww.gamespot.comcyberpunk2077userreviews220012859301"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-27,"i personally took a very long time to consider even making a review of this game. to figure out where i stood on principle versus the game itself is a little difficult. my original playthrough of cyberpunk went really well, bugfree, but it was clear cdpr had lied to consumers for the sake of puffing up their investors, all in this weirdly ironic semblance of what corporate greed can do much like within the cyberpunk setting itself. the patches has come, and the dlc is announced now, but i feel this game is a far, far cry from what was promised. subsequent attempts at playthough feel even more buggy now, perhaps my first run was lucky, perhaps fixing bugs caused others, i'm unsure. what i do know is that cyberpunk, beyond it's interesting and wellexecuted story beats is a mess  at it's core. overfunded, underdeveloped and missold to thousands. i only hope the dlc is everything they promise it to be. when you can get it to work, there's gold in this game. tension, immersion and depth, but the closer you look, the more you put under a magnifying glass and the more you try to really find yourself steeped within the world that cdpr wanted to craft? the less the game will let you. melee combat is laughable, but intended to be fixed in the dlc, so we're told. stealth shooting is satisfying but the hacking is not anywhere close to what we expected it to be, all that and so much more making this title fall short of what could have been. it's average, the patches have made it more playable to many, and that's good but i wouldn't personally recommend anyone play this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-27,"i played on release, the prologue has to be my favourite part of the game with the dynamic between v and jackie being great but after that is just decent, the story is okay with some of the characters being interesting, namely takemura and judy, the side content in the open world is meaningless and boring, with little reward, the cars are pretty cool especially some the cars available for purchase in the late game, the weapons are interesting but the unique weapons are really fun to use i used johnny silverhand's pistol regularly i myself encountered very few glitches on day one besides one very particular bug where every tree in the game world would render in before anything else which resulted in everything just being covered in trees which was very strange but thankfully this has been fixed in one of the postlaunch patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-26,"this was not the game we were promised, nor the game that was advertised, through their own hubris cdpr became a parody of what this game represents in it's statements against corporate greed, but if you can set your initial upset aside, or ignore the voices of those disappointed by false promises, cyberpunk 2077 is a genuinely good game when it works."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-21,"glad i have it another chance so i've roughly 70 hours on this game since starting and completing it and i must say i have had an absolutely amazing time. let's be honest, the game had a terrible release and definitely knocked a lot of people's trust in cdpr, even i had a lot of issues with it when it released, floating cups, spawning chars, tposing enemies, you name it, it was there. so i put it away, wrote it off as a disappointment that couldn't be redeemed. the only reason i tried this again, is me and my friends often play tabletop rpg's and due to some scheduling conflicts over the summer, we've started doing oneshots of different games and cyberpunk red was one of them, which i assumed the role of netrunner for the team and had a great time. so i wanted more cyberpunk content which is why i reinstalled it and gave it a second chance. and oh my what an experience i've had. i'll start off with what i disliked first and foremost and believe it or not, there's not too much now that a majority of the bugs have been fixed. there are still bugs, unfortunately when a game like this is built under the crunch conditions that it was, no amount of reparations is going to fix that. stuff from floating cars on occasion, like 1 every 10 hours for me, ui bugs were the worst, sometimes forcing me to reload a save. ai would occasionally get stuck in a daft location. the driving is okay, it's nothing to write home about, no real vehicle damage except under big crashes and i noticed when you hit a certain mph, cars and pedestrians simply stop rendering, which is cool cause it gives you a straight road to blast down at 210mph, but it's unrealistic, let's be honest. i am playing on quite high end pc so i don't believe it was a rendering issue, it seems that it's been implemented this way purposefully. i didn't think the ending was the best but i've heard it's to set us up for some dlc in 2023 so hopefully that'll resolve any gripes i had with the ending and give me a more satisfying conclusion. now for what i liked. the gameplay was great, i played an intelligencequick hacking build because i didn't want to just go all shootery like we can do in 100 different other games, i wanted to try the unique system built for the game i had an absolute blast. truth be told i wouldn't recommend playing any other way, if you want to go balls to the wall shooter, you might as well just be playing borderlands or the likes. getting your cyberdeck upgrades and different hacks and more ram was the best thing for me. jacking into networks, taking over cameras whilst being hidden outside a compound and just frying everyone to death whilst being nowhere near, muah, chefs kiss. the city itself, the map, oh my days it's beautiful, it feels like a real living breathing city, with a bunch of side quests to do that don't take you out of the action. you can walk around the different parts of the city and it genuinely feels like this map has been crafted with love and care and easily replicates what one would imagine a real city to be like in this setting. truly magnificent. the characters you meet, from panam, to river, to peralez's, these characters are all well thought out they feel like real people with aspirations and goals and not a lot of the dialogue feels scripted and samey, they do feel like genuine characters who have been well thought out and the voice acting has been done perfectly. truth be told when the game ended, part of me felt like i'd lost a bunch of friends, even the protagonist i was playing as. the story is great, this is proper cdpr writing, from start to finish for the main story and some of the extended side quests, everything about it was great. of course there are some detractors such as missions where you're just walking with someone hitting out with exposition which can be a bit slow paced, but overall the storytelling in this game is phenomenal, so much so that i can promise if you can look past some of the bugs sometimes i'd just lie to myself and pretend it was a glitch with my implants then you'll find one of the most amazing stories ever. there was times where i'd be going on a mission with a literal pit in my stomach from nerves, like i was actually undertaking the job in real life. and not many games can achieve that. this game now holds a strong place in my heart, i can't believe it's over. i did all the side biz, all the chars storylines, all the gigs, pretty much all you can do except if you're going for a 100 achievement run. i'm going to miss this game but i'm anticipating the dlc release and you can be damn sure i'll be picking it up on release and taking that day off work. you got a lot of hate cdpr, and you deserved it for releasing this absolute diamond in such a state but i commend you on what you did right, you've created a compelling, amazing story with fantastic gameplay to boot. i look forward to seeing a sequel."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-20,"one of the biggest lies in the world of games,one of the most buggy games i've ever seen in my life.deserves 6 because of the story only."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-20,"cy2077 is a revolutionary title for it's fleshed visuals of it's world. everything in the environment ads to it's atmosphere such as magazines, flatscreen televisions, futuristic technology, lore of the world , etc. however, while it excels in those things, it falls rather short on other aspects too much unecessary clutter of worthless loot, very little rpg mecanics such as decisions, world feeling souless, uninteresting quests, gameplay that involves tedious ''detective'' work, gameplay that sums up as walking to location and shooting everything and last but not least very boring gameplay mecanics. the gameplay mecanics are really just a shooter looter in the 1st pov which is tantamount to a fps thus, this makes the game incredibly bland and boring. the unecessary amount of items or loot is just masks the barebones game. it's really an empty shell of a world with scripted scenes from an uninteresting story. to be honest, the anime which was released had much better storyit was a masterpiece. i would not really recommend this game. it will leave you feeling empty as it's an empty game. everything you see in front of you is just a distraction or an empty shell. the game itself is boring. let me quote another reviewer who describes it in another way quote the game is a mediocre action shooter in an open world which is meaningless and just a noninteractive scenery. reminds me of mafiarockstar titles. at the beginning the city impresses, later it is boring as the scenery is more or less ever the same. the main storyies is the only interesting part and this story itself is mediocre. fights don't feel satisfying, sneaking is underwhelming. the game is pretty linar while you are forced to repeat boring grindgigs to make money. cyberpunk 2077 is a bad farcry title in a cyberpunk setting with better story than ubisoft titles. a bit like a mafia title. for cdpr and the hype it is more than underwhelming. end of quote"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-20,what a wild ride! the best mix of stunning graphics and wellmade writing i had experienced since a long time. thanks crpr!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-20,"what can i say... about a year after this game release, i started playing this piece of art for about 3 or 4 months, completing its history at the minimum details. i preorder the game knowing it may come with some bugs. but even at the initial release, cyberpunk 2077 was an artistic marvel. things had only improved from there to now. this game story is so full of context which it's hard to keep track of everything happening in your surrounds all at the same time. if you like rpgs, this game is definitely for you. next dlc will probably turn it in even a more enjoyable experience with many qol improvements."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-19,"good game but they fixed the bugs and such 3 after the release of the game anyway, and the game is too overhyped for my taste."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-17,"first of all, i must say that i have almost no performance issues reported by many other players. i got a ryzen 5800x with rtx 3090 and 32gig of ram. so with everything maxed out including rays i got stable 50 to 70 fps. but there are lots of visual bugs and glitches like floating heads inside cars, people stuck in stairs, mirrors not showing your hat and so on. this can and will be fixed by cdpr soon, i have no doubts about. it is sad they had to launch the game in current unpolished state, but this is a minor annoyance. however, the game has many flaws that will be very hard to fix if possible at all. first, the rpg element almost nonexistent. dialogue options are not options at all  v's personality is preset and you would not have a luxury to choose his mood or alter his attitude. some dialogues will not conclude unless you choose all available response options one by one and only after that script moves you further. npc will not react on how you look or how cool your car is. in fact, they will not be affected by your actions at all. i ran naked with a drawn katana in a public market and nobody gave a wet slap about that. i do not see how that can be fixed without rewriting . the world is truly, stunningly beautiful and created with love. especially if you are fan of blade runner, neuromancer, deus ex, matrix and all other things cyberpunk. and it is very sad you will not be able to interact with vast majority of things in this world no playing on  machines, no eating noodles in a chines street food stalls, no smashing vending machines for another can of cola. you are not even allowed to sit on a bench and admire the view unless it is required by a main questline script. and this is not likely to be fixed with future patches as well, i afraid. to sum it up. buy it now at the full price only if you are hardcore cyberpunk fan. if you look for good rpg or even a decent bugfree action game, wait for future patches and discounts. will be happy to return and give a higher rate later after this mess is patched. 410 now. update as of june 2023. now it shines! really, good job cdpr, you fixed almost everything that could be fixed. it's not a masterpiece like witcher3, but a great game anyway. go grab it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-17,"undoubtedly the best story, the most lively and developed characters, the soundtracks on high. this game was initially severely underrated because of the bugs in which, according to the cdpr themselves, they are not even to blame. this is a great shame."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-17,"cyberpunk 2077 plunges players into a stunning dystopian vision of night city, where electronics dominate and savage capitalism rules. the game's multilayered story weaves a complex narrative, accompanied by shocking twists and climactic endings that leave a lasting impact. with its versatile gameplay and stateoftheart style, cyberpunk 2077 revolutionizes the gaming experience. characters like johnny silverhand, trapped inside v, undergo remarkable personal development, embarking on a journey through this cruel yet beautiful world. along the way, encounters with complex villains, such as the arasaka family, and friendships with memorable individuals like panam and river add depth to the story. despite initial disappointment caused by overhyped features and glitches, cyberpunk 2077 remains one of the best video games of all time, showcasing the dark underbelly of a technologically dominated society and offering a truly immersive experience once the necessary updates were implemented."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-06,"this is not a gdr, but cd project sold it like it was. if i was just told as a fps game, i would have given a 9, but i expected an actual character development, skill trees and quests with choices."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-05,"i really liked the game. in my opinion, it's worth playing, and the story was quite solid. i had a lot of fun. however, it would have been even better if they made it longer. the graphics of the game looked really stunning, especially wandering around the city at night was a whole different experience. the side quests in the game were really enjoyable, sometimes even more fun than the main quests. cdpr is already great at designing side quests, and they have improved themselves even more after the witcher. it would have been better if they had developed the artificial intelligence more in the game in my opinion, the ai felt quite weak. i didn't like the police chases in the game, as it was easy to escape or when we shot npcs, they would teleport right next to us when our wanted level increased. they could have implemented a better system for that. i played the game long after its release with good pc setup, so i didn't encounter many optimization issues, bugs, or glitches. it's somewhat normal for major games to have significant bug problems when they are first released because making a game is not an easy task, and they gradually fix the bugs to improve the game. on one hand, players had excessively high expectations for this game, and when they saw the bugs upon its release, they got very angry due to the overhype. i think the game is in a good state now. i completed the game in 110 hours main quests  side quests  extra content, and my game only crashed once. i had a few minor issues, like my character's head turning black a couple of times. in my opinion the game didn't deserve to be criticized so heavily. i liked it, i think you should give it a try."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-04,great depth and attention to details. just wait a bit for the fix. don't put on all that hate. also this game is intended for next gen system. they should have left the old ones alone.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-03,"the amount of hype cyberpunk 2077 gathered before its release was unreal, i've never seen so much hype for a videogame ever before. cd projekt red promised so many things, to the point where everyone praised them and had high hopes. unfortunately, cyberpunk 2077 didn't deliver, so many broken promises, poor performance, lies and the game just isn't this holy grail that everyone expected, is it good? yeah, of course, some things about it are absolutely amazing, but the amount of issues is quite staggering, issues that go beyond just the poor performance. the story is surprisingly solid, it touches some interesting topics and has depth, great setpieces, a lot of action and some pretty emotional scenes. the characters are likeable and the pacing is very consistent even though the last few hours felt a little bit rushed. the gunplay feels satisfying, every weapon has a different feeling to it, and there are some special guns with unique powerups. there is a decent amount of weapons to get, upgrades and skills to unlock, nothing extraordinary but pretty nice. the world looks gorgeous, night city is one of the best looking cities in a videogame and it's filled with content, the side quests are phenomenal, and i enjoyed exploring. where the game disappointed me the most is the ai, it's very outdated, the world feels lifeless and you can't interact with the people or the city. the rpg mechanics are the biggest offender, the game barely feels like an rpg, the dialogue options are almost absent and choices barely matter. lastly, i did encounter some visual glitches, texture popins, frame drops and even crashes, but i still enjoyed the game, granted i am not justifying the fact that cd projekt red lied to the customers. ultimately this game is a weak rpg but still a great game in many ways, and as much as i enjoyed it, i can definitely say that its flawed to its core. despite the technical issues the game suffers from, this is some of cd projekt red's best work so far, it definitely could've been a masterpiece, but the foundation is broken, what a shame. final rating fantastic  8.510."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-06-01,"based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, i will give it a rating of 4."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-23,"pros one of the best openworld experiences i have ever seen in any game. i felt the developers worked their asses off for every detail in the map. sidecharacter quests were my favorites. very interesting, and enjoyable. random side quests like the cyber p, or delamain were also excellent. filled with realistic dialogue that makes you laugh or deeply think about how technology can evolve, in a black mirror way. however, there are not many of these types of quests. gameplay and the advancements are enjoyable. i never got bored during combat. cons ai is extremely poor. enemies act stupidly, but not so much that it ruins combat. traffic ai is stupid. when you park a car just slightly on street, all the other cars behind you stop and wait. they do not look for another solution, drive around in their car, or get out and walk. they just sit in their car for hours. the main story started out well, and the endings were also great. however, i was shocked when the point of no return sign appeared. in my opinion, it was too soon. this might have been because of the release date rush. sad to see how much potential was wasted. police activities and gigs are repetitive. however, combat makes them enjoyable. some parts of the map were not designed properly. i guess they didn't have time to polish. for example, the badlands have a lot of trash on the ground. if you decide to go through there, either on foot or in a vehicle, it becomes a nightmare."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-22,"i bought the game 6 months after the release. sometimes there were bugs, but overall the joy of the gameplay covered up the imperfections. the world is beautiful and diverse, the storyline engaging and interesting. characters complex and with character. i can honestly recommend this title."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-20,"technically it's so lacking why did i like this game so much, even though it is a game with unsettled mechanics, full of errors, and optimization problems? i think i know the answer, it acts as an artificial pain reliever for my existential pangs.... i have changed my mind. this game is broken, still broken. also missing..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-19,yes i know how it was horrible in the launch. i was one of the ps4 owners and i preordered it. it was too dissapointing after buying a new console i decided to give an another chance. story and the world was amazing. rpg elements was not that great but enjoyed it. you can be really powerful if you make a good build.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-05-18,"the result of mismanagement that turned a great game into a flawed game full of bugs nevertheless, in my opinion, this game deserved much higher scores, the colorful city, the city of the night, and the map with many details, captivating gameplay and the wonderful story, which gives you the feeling of walking in the night city, an indescribable feeling that every gamer should have. experience as often as possible the dark story mixed with the cyberpunk theme will make you disappear and i was very happy with the great support of the cd project team for this game now it's 2023, with bugs fixed and the release of 9th generation consoles, cyberpunk has become a great game that everyone should experience, but the problems that occurred during its release destroyed the game's glory and now it's too late to turn back cyberpunk could have been delayed and released to the market with the game's problem solved and an action roleplaying game like skyrim, witcher 3 and rdr2 will remain in the memory for a long time"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-26,"it's been 2 years. as of patch 1.52, the game is still a buggy mess and it still fails to deliver on its hype and promises and at this point it is safe to say it never will. many promised features multiplayer got scrapped completely. it's a ray tracing tech demo, nothing more, and to be honest the red engine ain't that great! while the ray tracing and the city looks fine, the character models don't. the open world is still sterile and lifeless, npcs are brain dead and the police still can't drive. immersion? don't make me laugh i mean cry, i spent 60 on this garbage. metro system they promised? nah. it also manages to look worse than the 2018 e3 demo another downgrade just like in the witcher 3. all those different ways to solve quests they promised? another lie choose between hacking sort of cybersniping, shooting or melee'ing your way through the thugs. awesome choices indeed  and done in just about every modern game nowadays. then there's the bugs tposes in cut scenes still persist, plotstopping bugs, too. i encountered a bug where i could not start an essential mission. want to play a good cyberpunk shooter? buy necromunda hired gun instead. it's a billion times better than this. i regret buying this garbage. it isn't even worth 10. this will be the last cdpr game i'll buy. uninstalled for good. rip cd projektred. but then you have the fanboys who would celebrate cdpr if they sold them a giftwrapped turd  o wait, they did just that with cyberpunk!!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-13,"cyberpunk 2077 is a difficult to review game. it has one of the most beautiful cities in a game, at least in my opinion. the futuristic style, the neon lights, everything here appeals to me. the sidequests in this game are, again, some of the best that i have seen. i don't usually do side content, but here every quest felt as if it belonged to the main story. the designs of the cars are interesting and diverse no flying cars tho sadly i'll get to it, same goes for the weapons. i also loved the cyberware system, which allows you to enhance your body with claw arms or a double jump and alike. the story is fantastic. this is one of the few games that made me feel that man insert horse looking at sea meme feeling that i think most people are looking for. sadly, all of this points have a but attached to them. the city may be beautiful, but feels empty with not many npcs roaming the streets and driving cars. speaking of which, the ai is one of the worst ais i've seen in any aaa game to date. enemies will sometimes just stop doing anything and don't even get me started on their driving ai. still, it's good enough. to that you can also add a completely broken wanted system. the biggest flaw with this game right now isn't any of the mechanics or crashes that too don't get me wrong, but something from the past. it's marketing. cd projekt promised way too much that they couldn't deliver and may even be considered false advertising. with that said, i still loved the game and will continue playing, at least until i finished some of the biggest sidequests and got the stuff that i want. hopefully the dlc will live up to the expectations."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-11,"far from the revolutionary product they promised. the truth is that i'm disappointed. i tried to play it on 1.6 and left it, now i've tried again with 1.61 and finished it with a couple of endings and in a hurry. the graphics and the main story are quite spectacular, however and unfortunately, it's not enough for me. a game feeling from 10 years ago farcry 3 is more polished, mediocre physics errors and more errors, mediocre driving, mediocre immersion, mediocre city, mediocre role elements, mediocre  map is not like rdr2 or witcher, where you feel the immensity and infinite possibilities. you can run around the city for hours without extraordinary events or strange appearances apart from bugs. this is just a cool and death city to make pics, nothing else. it was a very bad decision not to put a thirdperson mode in a game where aesthetics are so important, or at least in conversations, to come out in thirdperson mode and see the character talk, gesture, etc, something like mass effect. it's incredible that the only place we can see this is in the mirror of our house, that disconnected me a lot from the experience notice that the thirdperson mod is garbage, in case someone thinks it fixes it. the duality with keanu is something original although i didn't love it, i like to identify myself and connect with the characters, a dual character complicates that task for me. on the other hand, the fact of finding out that you are dying so soon hurts the game for me, it does not make any sense to buy cars or motorcycles or houses if you are desperate to cure yourself or find a solution to your chip. the only thing i want in those circumstances is to beat the game quickly. in rdr2 you get tuberculosis when you go to 80 of the game, that's well in place to speed up the end, but in the rest of the game, please let me enjoy for god's sake this game lacked a lot of care, attention and dedication, the truth is that i don't understand what they did for so long and so many extensions because the game gives a lot of feeling of being incomplete. i see the witcher 3 and then i see cyberpunk and i don't understand anything... let's hope the guys from cdproject get back on track."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-09,"a very cool game, the greatest game i've played in my life, great missions, a deep and dark story that embodies the dark future and institutional control in the human world, very cool side missions, great shooting mechanics, smooth game control, fairytale gameplay system, excitement and action in fun game stages and a world full of interesting things. no open world rpg has ever been played better than this game in my life"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-06,"i tried it after patch 1.61 and dlss 3 update, i can definitely say that this game has finally reached beta 2 years after its release. i can't believe how they waste this pure potential. what a pity."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-04,"cyberpunk doesn't live up to the hype cdpr created by their false advertisements. this hype wasn't something brought by the community, it literally derived from their ads and what they promised. lots of rpg features missing, the game plays like a linear fps with a mediocre skill system. doesn't even deserve this much score at the moment, it would've been obliterated if it was developed by another studio without these advertisements."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-02,"what can i say? i am incredibly disappointed in how cdpr has handled the marketing and release for this game. the trailers and previews in hindsight look flat out shady and dishonest, to the point of feeling like a scam, frankly. i fully trusted them but it feels like they were playing me for an idiot all along. almost all of the gameplay trailer content has been taken from very tiny, specific areas of the game in order to selectively hype gameplay features that are pretty much all cut from the game at release. even the story trailers dub dialogue over tiny scenes from the game to falsely create the impression that much more is going on than actually happens in the game. now don't get me wrong  there are some areas of the game that are great. the city design is amazing visually, and impressive in terms of size. but the game itself, the actual ai routines and so on are very disappointing. the city is dead. a perfect example is gangs. criminals will just stand on street corners and basically ignore you, even when you walk right up to them. these are supposed to be violent street muggers! by far the biggest let down for me is the nextgen branching storyline. it simply doesn't exist! you sit for literally hours on end talking to characters, yet nothing you say makes any difference at all. it's absolutely bizarre. developers spent months doing interviews excitedly gushing about how much you can change the story with things you say to people, and then the actual story itself ingame feels almost 100 linear. in fact, the dialogue can even feel insulting. characters will ask you to make big important decisions, the game gives you a  then literally nothing happens as a result. things just happen as they would have anyway. it's really annoying and it makes all the hype seem like flat out lies. on top of that, anything else that offers you choice, like non lethality is also pointless. you can knock characters unconscious and other characters will talk about how they're dead. stupid. cdpr seem content to sit back now and become the next ea. a company that lies to their customers and doesn't care about them. they have completely lost the moral high ground over other companies that they used to boast about."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-04-01,"some nice characters and stories nested in a breathtaking open world, undercut by jarring bugs at every turn. rpg elements that i expected were missing. if that part didn't gone for missing, then cyberpunk 2077 would be remembered with perfection, not disappointment. anyway, i liked the way of the introducing characters, i was expecting more from cp2077 but still a good game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-30,"another masterpiece from cd project red. one of my favorite games. the most atmospheric, beautiful and technological game. it is impossible to forget the very bad start, when there was no optimization. but the developers have fixed it all, and a big respect for it, not every company will be able to. the story is very interesting and makes you care about the characters, but unfortunately the plot is short. yes, i got through the ending only after 24 hours of play, but i didn't even notice how i got to the end, but the story impressed me, one of my favorite plots. despite the poor optimization when the game first came out, i saw 23 bugs in 24 hours, and they didn't interfere with gameplay, and were more of a laugh than an annoyance. the game never crashed and worked with a stable 60 fps. i got only positive emotions from the game, and thanks to the fact that the developers have worked hard on the game optimization, now the cyberpunk 2077 game is worth all its money, and does not look like what it was on release. i truly love this game. i can't give it any lower than 10."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-16,"i have mixed feelings. i definitely liked the way the artists graphic designers worked on the world. millions of details, lighting, environment design, characters!, vehicles, weapons and almost everything from an artistic point of view is amazing. and this is, perhaps, one of the best things in the game. the world of cyberpunk 2077 is incredible. story well, story could be better. yet still the story is much better than actually gameplay. gameplay is simply boring. shooting part is not fun, stealth is boring. overall, cyberpunk gameplay is just not enjoyable.  story  8 atmosphere  8 design  10 graphic technically  9 gameplay  7 characters  10 sound design  7"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-14,"played on pc for 7h at the moment. yes, there are few bugs but nothing major at the moment, no game breaking bugs or crashes game ver 1.03. game is running pretty good on mix of mediumhigh settings on mediocre pc 8600k, 1070ti, 16gb ram, ssd and still looks very good. the story is interesting, crafting system looks useful didnt play with it too much atm, car driving model is weird but you get used to it after some time. the only annoyance is sound, looks like something went wrong with sound normalization as sometimes npc are talking really laud and the other times you can barely hear them."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-07,"feels high quality great graphics great story voice acting is great  japanese  different variety of npcs ambiance is great satisfying gameplay it is not perfect, but this is a lot better than other games this generation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-06,"almost perfect game. well designed combat, alive open world with rich narrative. it has some small bugs but its a good game at all. sometimes dialogs gets in each other and some npcs are struggles to understand environment but these are not big deal."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-05,"pretty decent game on ps5, really good graphics and atmosphere. only encounter a few bugs nothing too critical. great game overall and worth the pickup especially on a discount."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-05,"amazing story, amazing charakters, really cool gun play. minimal bugs, but not a problem at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-03,"cyberpunk 2077 is the game we were waiting for big, funny, full of quests and with a lot of rpg aspects perfectly integrated in the gameplay. sadly it has a lot of bugs too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-01,my advice never play cyberpunk.. search up the games issues on the internet and find out yalls self.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-03-01,"patch 1.6  at this point, it's definitely time to play for those who waited for the game to be fixed throughout my gameplay 70 hours into the game, and still craving for more never had any case of severe bugs or glitches. the only technical difficulties i've experienced are long loading times and lack of crowds and traffic in the streets. gameplay itself seems kinda smooth, interesting, and variable, but i didn't catch the point of the complicated character development system. although i love that the game gives you a lot of freedom and variability in your actions and walkthrough. it's kinda unsettling that by choosing different paths in your dialogues and actions you simply cut out a huge part of the game and story for yourself. funny contradiction after so many hours somehow it still feels like it's not enough content here for me maybe because of the vastness of the world, the areas of the city that were not exploredincluded in the story.... the best things about this game the narrativeplot, the city, the cyberpunk atmosphere, and the soundtrack is out of this world  the best one that i could have ever imagined! it's so cool just to drive around this beautiful city while listening to those cool tracks or while you're in a fight. the game is certainly worth revisiting several times more. thank you, cdpr, for all the joy. almost breathtaking!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-28,"although the game is full of bugs, cd projekt red has done a tremendous job in terms of story and city design. i was only able to play two years after it came out, but it was worth it. i would like to give 10 points but it would be unfair to witcher 3. there are still many things in the game that could be better. i hope you will create more beautiful masterpieces with the lessons you have learned from this game from now on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-27,"definitely give it a try i know this game was a flop on release, there were many bugs and glitches. even in 2023, there are still many occurring on some occasion. the game is still missing many features cd projekt promised to offer. it was an absolute disaster, but things changed. cd projekt then released an anime adaptation in the late 2022. and its popularity rose in sudden. say, theyre quite good at marketing. even though many people still hate it, they managed to make a comeback. me myself, also watched the whole series and i pretty much enjoyed it. but this has nothing to do with me purchasing the game. to be honest, im a scifi geek, id love to see anything that has flying cars, spaceships or goofyass technology that will sound funny in the next decade. thats why i gave it a try because i just wanted to see the future worlds. but when i played it, this game just feels different. the story it tells was quite good, the theme evolves around the concept of a society with technological advancement but still has high poverty and the lack of justice. they did great with the character writings, when i went through different stories. there were always some character relationships for me to care about. if you managed to save some of these characters from their deaths or reach the point where everything is an absolute mess, the game gives you whole new quests with its own storyline revealing entirely new experience off the main story. the main plot was a bit too short for a game this big. however, you can complete side quests stories that could potentially cause different endings. if you just want to play for the story, i recommend searching on wiki before doing some quests. because youll have no idea what quest or what choice you have taken will lead to what situation , these quests would appear along with the normal side quests, if you skipped all of these, or answer some of the dialog wrong, youll missed an entire chapter of the story, and you cant go back to play it again. i found this was very annoying at first, i recommend installing cheats. the criteria were good, the story was engaging, there were ups and downs most of all, high octane action sequences. they put so much effort into this. the art was fantastic, the architecture of buildings, the vehicles design, music productions. they even created a fictional band to make a character believable. all these elements just make the night city feels real, like an actual city. however, the boss fight with adam smasher was quite boring. it was hard because they made him a juggernaut, his attacks were slow. the game just feels slow when youre fighting adam smasher. and this is not fun at all, id rather have a fight with his minions. but anything besides that was pretty much enjoyable. if you are a scifi geek, artist looking for references, game developers or just a normal ass gamer. definitely give this game a try i feel like this game can be more finished, we might have to wait and see what happens in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-26,"i don't know what there is to discuss when in 2 years of updates the game is not what we were presented with. the characters, the story, the music are on a high level and that's where the game's pluses end. it's only a year and a half after release that the npc's have started to respond to world events. just think about it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-26,"the game is gorgeous, especially the pc version. i did not download it immediately after it came out, i decided to wait and for good reason. with the release of the latest patch, the game has become simply amazing, yes there are bugs but in which games they don't happen, have you ever seen the latest games from ubisoft ? i can tell those who didn't dare to buy or have seen enough negative videos, that the game can and should be bought"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-25,this game at start had very much bugs and bad optimization but now it is perfect. weapons are perfect story line to gameplay also. i dont know how people expected on console that realised at 2013 turn on game that is lagging on rtx 3060.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-25,"the game is buggy and problematic, yes, but the main missions are perfect and that's enough for me. i loved the atmosphere they created based on the pen and paper settings. the graphics were very nice, the characters you talked to were as if you were watching cinematic. even turning on the 106.9 30 principales radio channel and wandering around the streets was very enjoyable. it is a shame that they released this game without polishing it completely. the infamy of the bugs masked the good parts of the game. this could be a 1010 only if they released it after a few years. they rushed to release the game on 2020, and this caused the overhype syndrome for teenager gamers. we, older pc gamers, are used to played buggy games since 90s. but these new generation of gamers only play polished aaa games. that's why this was a risky move, and they failed hard, and rdr2 fans used this failure to bash and mock the game. gg. 8 very good  it deserves to be popular, although some of its faults are obvious."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-25,"!      ,    ,      ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-23,"really enjoyed the game. had a great story and the game is also really long, and there are plenty of side quests to keep you entertained"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-22,"pretty nice game, but overrated, imho. bad optimisation and story, nice music and graphics. overall, cyberpunk 2077 is very limited by your graphics card. although faster processors will allow a highend gpu to perform at its full protentional, your cpu usually isnt a bottleneck in the game. its very heavy on graphics, so high amounts of vram and lots of graphics processing power are the way to go if you want the best performance in the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-22,"overall 7.510 story  810  fascinating, it really uses well the cyberpunk element, especially with those philosophical questions about saving a person's mind in a computer or altering someone's mind. it sometimes appears as a black mirror episode, both in the main story and sometimes in the sidequests, those scifiphilosophicalcreepy parts are the best ones of the story. it has also very good characters, the main character has some personality it isn't just a blank person and the other characters are all likable, even the villains are interesting. but at same time i couldn't have a sentimental bond like with some really memorable characters like arthur morgan rdr2 or kratos from the new gow. at the end of the day, the characters are interesting but nothing above that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-18,this game deserves better. there is so much bugs even now but i still enjoy it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-10,"it's better than i thought it would be. however, there were so many problems at the beginning that i waited to buy it. and that was the right thing to do!  und an all die schwachkpfe aus russland die hier mit 0 bewerten. ihr seid doch selber schuld, also haltet einfach die fresse!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-09,"overall i had a lot of fun playing this game and ended up 100 completing this. not quite at the spot of one of my favourite games, and not quite worth the full price. that said it's frequently on sale and worth getting at 50 off. mods help this game a lot, fixing a lot of the small bugs or adding things like auto loot everything you see with a button to help save time, or allowing you to respec. this game also really isn't as fun if you're running a generalist build so i highly recommend you specialise. i've done playthroughs where i first focused on intelligence and coolcrafting, but it's a much slowerpaced game. if you are new i recommend taking the body tree, followed by cool and reflexs as that gives you the sandevstan and all the best cyberware in the game. focus on the body stat first followed by reflexes and cool, starting with 6 body, 6 cool, and 4 reflex and getting cool to 7 before focusing on body and then catching up reflexs is great as it lets you take the perk 15 more damage to all humans. the story isn't bad and the endings especially managed to get my interest a fair bit."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-08,"cyberpunk 2077, very good action, good snack without some flaws. i enjoyed playing it until i finished the whole main story! as far as i'm concerned, the game is ok, not wow, but kudos to the game cd projekt red!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-08,i got this game in 2021 and i did not like it but since then i replayed it and i found myself loving this game and it quickly made it's way into my top 3 games. i played trough the game on ps 4 pro first and then on pc. and while it's true that it did deserve most of the hate because of the bugs it should not be overlooked that this game's story is amazing. this is one of the best stories told in a game in my opinion. if you like a good story that you can get invested in than this is a must buy. and i'd say it's worth it on last gen too but it is a lot more rough on that version.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-07,"cyberpunk has some flaws with physics, optimization or bugs. but i think the characters, music and world design make it easy to believe the story the creator is telling because you feel it's real."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-07,"cdpr delivered an ok first attempt at capturing the cyberpunk universe. despite the patches and updates, the game still feels undercooked. it's like a meal that's been finished off in the microwave  tepid and unsatisfying. the story is cool, night city is awesome, and you can make this game better with mods and the mod support for this game is pretty good. overall, not as bad as people say it is, but also not as good as cdpr promised. i hope they learn from this one and make a sequel which blows this one out of the water."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-05,"this game was the most hyped game of all time, i can't think of any thing that came close. when you are attracting this much attention, its only natural that you will also attract the negative kind and given the optimization for the last gen consoles at launch, it was an easy target to pile on. the technical side i've played it at launch on a beefy pc and except a few clippings i really didn't encounter any other issue in regards to the technical side of the game. yes the ai of npcs isn't the best, but personally it didn't bothered me that much. the combat system is pretty amazing, close in feeling to some of the best fps, not exactly at that level but pretty close. add to the fact that you can tackle fights in multiple ways only adds to the depth of the combat. the aestheticsarchitecture of night city is breathtaking as keanu would say, both in bad ways and good ways. there are extreme differences in the rich sides of the city and the poor side of the side and both will dazzle in their own way and will make night city the best city to explore currently in any game. the economy was underwhelming, at the very least at launch, now i understand that it got some optimization which makes it way more palatable for the average player. the narrative the story is pretty amazing, as you should expect from cdpr, albeit way shorter than i imagined. now that i think about, i think the short main story may be my biggest gripe with the game. for obvious reasons, i won't go into details regarding this as i would be spoiling. world building, side missions, characters, dialogues, pretty much all of the narrative is some of the best out there. romance options, for those interested, are pretty few in terms of number, as per the studio's previous works, but i would say they are pretty well done. closing some people exaggerated with their expectations and felt let down because of it. i expected from cdpr something close to the level of witcher 3, which is my favorite game even to this day and while it didn't surpassed it, i would say they come pretty close. is the game perfect ? no, of course not, no game is perfect and no game will ever be perfect as there are always things to make it better but that is a sure way to never get your game released."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-05,"i think it's a shame it got off to such a bad start and most people are still holding on to those ill feelings. i played it in 2023 for the first time with a blank slate and think it's quite frankly one of the best games i've ever played. very little i could fault it on, just an incredibly enjoyable open world experience. it passed the most important test for me which is that night city became a world that i just didn't want to leave. sure there maybe still a few bugs in it today but none of them broke the game for me and with a game so large and ambitious it's bound to have the odd imperfection. couldn't recommend this game enough though and truly think if it had been released in the shape it is today on launch it would be 9s and 10s all round."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-05,"i really tried liking this game but unfortunately is not for me. in respect for open world games which is my favorite genre i really tried to at least finish the main story but i had to stop at around 9 hours in because i just couldn't really connect with the story or the world in general. pretty outdated graphics along with some bugs, bad story and characters and you have a mediocre game. this is just my experience and my perspective and i totally understand and believe if other people feel different and enjoy this game. but unfortunately this game is not for me."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-02-02,"i completely understand the dislike at launches and its completely deserved. the game was a hot mess at launch. i happened to play it a couple months after and it was still in that state. i have a higher tolerance for glitches and dont really care all that much about bugs. besides ones that crash the game i can get over any technical mistakes made by developers. however, i believe cyberpunk is a great game, its world building, characters, gameplay is all top tier. my biggest complaint is that some rpg elements are missing that would boost the game so much more. lack of customization and unique side quests are what bring it down for me. many side quests are dumbed down to mercenary gigs to do around town which felt repetitive and lazy. i also hate how player choice has virtually zero effect on the storys outcome. you could be an absolute  to everyone and still get a good ending for yourself. looking at the story as a whole, i think it tells something unique and powerful and the relationships made along the journey feel real and important to v. today, i believe cyberpunk is fixed and any hate towards its state now is purely a subjective opinion rather than some objective criticism over its technical state. the game plays perfectly now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-30,"to be honest, i downloaded it from torrent, because of pretty bad situation with money, because of war in my country. but i played it, and i can say that... if it's not the best, then one of the best games i've ever played!!! this style, this plot and story, this characters... oh my god, it's something incredible! yeah, there're some problems, like pretty bad physics of driving, or bugs, but it doesnt matter. the game, is so freaking cool, that i can't even describe it... thank you, cdpr, for this piece of masterpiece. i promise, when 'money problems' will go, i will buy the game, even for my friends."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-27,"despite its early technical problems one of my three favourite games of all time. entertaining combat, good story and fantastic graphics, especially with raytracing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-27,garbage is not enough to describe this thing. came to play but instead had too watch a movie. too much dialog too much unnecessary things. upgrade system is terrible. if you have no life then this is the game for you. if we wanted to see a movie there is netflix . wtf were they thinking
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-24,"nothing much to positive to say about this except it's gorgeous, especially on a newer gfx card. the game play is meh, coming from the witcher 3 i had high hopes. the world doesn't really seem to be alive like in witcher 3. mostly just place holders. it's pretty much just mash buttons then next through meaningless dialogs different choices lead to the same outcome. i think this game wanted to be the next 's not. really disappointed. oh and there are still bugs 3 years after release. pauses in the game play, where the game seems to be thinking or something."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-22,"i picked cp2077 in early 2023 when patch 1.6 had already been around. just didn't want to ruin the experience at launch, with all those hilarious bug videos all over youtube. i feel sorry for the people who played the game in that state and cdrp did a shady thing for sure by pushing it to the market way too early, but let's be honest  at the moment, cyberpunk is one of the most impressive and stunning action rpgs of all time. it runs pretty well on pc, with just a few minor glitches left here and there, and now one can say that the journey to night city has become breathtaking indeed. i loved the story, with somewhat harsh ending options, and the characters, acting and writing are topnotch. the city also does the job well, letting one dive into the world of the future with tremendous attention to detail. the designs, the visuals, the sounds, the architecture, the vehicles oh my god the vehicles with unique and working interiors  everything is pushed to perfection. yes, some systems work not good at all like police, but i guess it is because people compare it to gta series while it is not a gta type of game  just think of it as a deus ex game, and everything will come back to place. the city is not a living thing, it is a playground to set story missions, and there is no point in exploring it on its own yea, that kinda a missed opportunity from the devs, but i kinda don't care  it could be years till we get another deus ex type of game with the level of quality close to cp2077, so i'm not complaining here a bit. i've put 200 hours into the game, clearing the map and all the gigs. and i should say  every minute was worth it. if you missed it due to bad word of mouth 2 years back, do yourself a favor and pick it up now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-18,one of the best games cd projekt it's underrated after the update great open world  rpg game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-17,"this is a very difficult game to review since some aspects are phenomenal, and others are dirtpoor. the good the story and characters are outstanding. in most games i get bored of hearing the uninteresting characters drone on, but here i was totally in for the ride. quickhacks were a lot of fun although they do eventually get a little stale and trivialize most encounters. the setting was gorgeous, and the locations were worth exploring just to see all the detail built into the world. mods do a lot to add content, polish rough spots, or tweak aspects of the game that aren't great by default. the bad i waited a full 2 years before trying this game after hearing about how massively buggy it was on release. since then it recently won steam's labor of love for all the subsequent work done to remedy its issues. but its still quite a mess. save often, and use many individual saves. you will probably have to roll back at some point. bugs are still all over the place. several entire systems in the game are barebones or janky. driving is miserable mod helps, but this is somewhat mitigated because cdpr is clearly aware of this shortcoming and includes almost no content while driving. underground fight leagues are also incredibly basic. in fact, you can win every fight by merely hard punching every opponent over and over due to stagger lock. overall, i'd say its worth buying on sale i got it for just over 20 with the 50 off sale epic store coupon. the positives are potent enough to endure the negatives. i already have nearly 100 hours in the game, and i'll surely replay it again at some point...hopefully after most of the existing issues have been resolved."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-17,"this is an review based on patch 1.6. soon, i lost much of the annoyance of the initial launch. despite all the initial noise, cdpr turned this title into a good game with updates. overall i ended up liking the story the character is infected by the soul of a rock star this is not a spoiler, it is the premise of the game. i finished my first session and wanted another, and another, and another...know all the endings...unfortunately all are sad, but the story is very very good. the characters have depth and you care about  they care about you... the game has many details and it is possible to see in the main characters including the dubbing cdpr's effort to make them memorable. unfortunately the most important negative point is that even in very difficult mode the main character becomes overpowered from the middle to the end, but due to the characteristics of an rpg this would be inevitable. controversies yes, much of what was promised is missing and the features announced earlier at launch are not yet present and will probably never be implemented, but the game is optimized and most of the bugs fixed. there are some points that bother me, like the lack of serious consequences for v's choices in side quests, for example, if you eliminate some members of a faction your relationship with the leader of that group does not change, it is irrelevant, and even so you acquire credibility with him and the other leaders. besides, the police part is pretty bad when they are looking for you they don't even chase your car, at most they send a drone and look there! but anyway....give it a chance, get it on sale, it's a unique game it's not perfect but if you accept the premise without prejudice there's a good chance you'll have fun i sincerely hope that more people try or revisit this title, as it would be very sad if it was only remembered for the failure of the initial release and not for what it became after all the work the devs did to make it as close as possible to what it was. people expected from night city. edit it's fair to say that among the contenders for steam's made with love award cp2k7 was perhaps not the best choice considering it was up against no mans sky  which has also had a failed release  but has been receiving relevant content to this day ... however, it must be considered that this award is destined to the game released some time ago and that its creators continue to support its creation, which corresponds to cdpr's effort to correct the defects and faults that came along with the release of this title... i'm already waiting for the expansion.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-16,"a pleasure to play. great story, superb graphics. just look at these characters. really enjoyable! everything the game promised it delivered"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-15,"after the last few patches, game got amazing! would definitely recommend if someone hasnt tried it yet to do so!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-15,"one of my favorites, for sure. graphics good, gameplay fun like 90 of the time, story great but quite a few bugs even now, a lot of missed opportunities and sometimes it feels overall empty cant say why. it is a great game but it does not hit the 100 mark. right now it is 85 of what it could be. there is quite a lot room for finetuning. lets see what phantom liberty brings us. i must say i had quite a lot of fun with the sidequests, also the main story is quite impactful. after 50 hours the gameplay might get a bit boring and if you look back at your playtime you will remember quite a few small and medium bugs. but at the end it will be quite a nice experience. buy it. i want to see a sequel in like 10 years in which they learned from their mistakes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-14,"there's a really good game hidden in here, but it's completely stifled by a lack of actual freedom and the longest and most frequent cutscenes i've ever experienced. pretty horrible dialogue too. i played for 20 hours and then couldn't be bothered anymore"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-05,i've returned to that game after a year. i'm fascinated about the world and diversity in missions. great effects and immersy. i'm waiting for more dlc's and mmo version

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2023-01-02,"''awful story'' i got the game at lauch on ps4 my review at this time would be 0 i returned the game to store it was a shame, i was in tears, i tried to play but game breaking bugs were present in a large amount but those was not my last words i got refunded and got to buy a pc with a rtx card only for this game lol but it became my main gaming system for everything. so i launched the game on pc months after with patches and edgerunners update, it was magic i had a lot of fun did a 100 here spent at least 400h on it, the game is awesome its a game to have fun maybe some can say like jumping out of the car is awful but if you see whats beside that the game is easy to take in hands the graphics and story is one of the best drama ever, everything in the game is a message hidden in the main script this is a masterpiece. i think thats why people was soooo upset at launch how can you support a crash or a game breaking bug  you do like really much like, i litterally tought i was going to cry when i first had to restart the game from 0 when i got stuck in a bug loop on ps4 yo the game was 100 too its money and some can take it next level by critically pointing the devs. so this game final review i give a 9 for the hard work and the good script it would be a 10 if i didnt got scammed on ps4 at launch."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-26,"not sure id have been able to give this a 8 if i had paid full price, got it 40 off and i really enjoyed the game. its really massive, lots of opportunities for combat and enjoyed the combat system, the stories are also rather interesting, lots of ways to kill and solve quests. easily put in 90 hours doing side and main missions, wished the main story was longer and a little more impact in the world when completing major missions or side gigs. time flew by when playing and a few sleep deprived days ensued with 'its what time?!?!?!' when taking a break. perhaps expectations and early bugs held the game back from higher reviews. the game was on the cusp of greatness, skyrim or rr2 scale and could have maybe been the best game ever. just falls short of that. it was very enjoyable. 100 recommend to buy on sale."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-26,"a great game that suffered from overhype. everything from characters to world and story are amazing. gameplay is deep, you can replay the game few times playing each time differently"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-18,another trash game like witcher 3... but i think it's way better than w3. so 110 from me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-17,"this game is a lie of a century. fact that some people are still trying to simp this company is just unbelievable. ubisoft has made some really sht games recently far cry 6, watch dogs legion, but they have also made countless of really good games far cry 3, price of persia games, splinter cell games, assassin's creed games, first watch dogs was fine. so in other words ubisoft has at least done something. what are cdprojectred's accomplishments? oh yeah, they made one playable game in 2015 i didn't like it btw, it was way too basic rpg. and then they made this fail, that's it. that's literally it. i'm not even counting witcher 1 and 2, that would be equal to count gta 1 and gta 2 for rockstar. sad stuff."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-16,"tldr this is an underwhelming lootershooter with super bad ia and other weird behaviors with a terrible, terrible ui. pretty, but lifeless cardboard world with very few things to do in it. it has a good story though. so that's it. if you want to play it, make sure it looks good because without that there's no point. tswm if you announce the grandest, most advanced nextgennest gaming ever and then you come out with this thing, then you had all the bad reviews coming. there's nothing nextgen about this game. forget the bugs and the glitches, theyre there but not that important. gameplay is bad, mostly cause of the horrible ai. npcs are comically unaware, so combat is often a joke. you throw bombs and fire guns in a room and npcs in the next room with the door open will often stay unaware or start yelling in loop im gonna find youuuu and stuff like that. behaviors of this sort are everywhere in the game. stealth is even less appealing due to the aforementioned bad ia, you just can't count on it and it often makes npcs behave in weird ways. sometimes they see through walls, sometimes they don't notice you when you're in front of them. most things get repetitive soon. youll perform the same hacks again and again, loot the same bunch of items again and again, same skin, same name, just different stats. there's so many crappy things to loot that it'll get unrewarding very soon. crafting, economy and general itemization are very shallow. crafting in particular looks like it's there just because it had to be. so far i've used it just to make ammo and maybe upgrade some weapon. in general you're always better off waiting to loot a better thing, which is often the same weapon you already have, just with better stats. customization is a joke. you either wear items with good stats and look like a clown or wear cool things with bad stats. there's not a lot of choice anyway. you can't even change your hair or beard, everything is locked after the character creation, which is simply amazing after they announced the deepest customization ever. and anyways it's not that important since you almost never see your character, so don't spend much time in it. the city is big and looks good, but it's a lifeless cardboard. interaction with it is very, very limited, all the doors are closed and npcs just say a bunch of stock phrases with no interaction. you can't eat at 90 of the vendors, they're just cardboard stores. you can't dance in a club, you can't play any minigame, again nothing except the few scripted things. don't expect to find unexpected things in a street or a dark alley, it's all just a facade and all the interest points are already on the map, and not that many. overall, looks like a game that needed at least another year of development to be okayish. five to ten years, instead, to maybe live up to the ginormous expectations they created."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-15,"e jugado a cyberpunk 2077 en 2022 y en pcversion 1.6. es un juego excelente donde te sientes vivo en el mundo, te encarias rpido de los personajes y quieres saber mas de ellos. la historia es el punto mas fuerte del juego, las misiones principales son divertidas e interesantes que disfrutas incluso con la corta duracin de la historia principal. lo malo es que aun hay bugs sin arreglar, pero suelen ser bugs que no te molestan para las misiones principales o secundarias."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-12,graphics mind blowing. story good. that's why i'm giving this score. audio also likable. everything else? even now garbage. your choices have 0 impact to story. life path? meaningless. what can you do after story ends? just slay dumb enemies till the end of time. not including missing features that was demonstrated in all trailers. remember what they said. we leave greed to others. but somehow didin't never send old gen demo keys to reviewers. and released game in horrible state. now it's kind a fixed but still can get bugs. people who giving 10 score is a joke tbh. spoiling company that literally trashed on gamers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-08,da die meisten schlechten bewertungen die ersten versionen betreffen sag ichs gleich dazu. betrifft version 1.6 eines der besten und umfangreichsten und dabei immer noch stimmigen spiele die ich je gespielt habe! atmosphre und grafik ist einfach geil wobei man natrlich auch die richtige hardware bentigt um in den vollen genuss zu kommen. eine radeon 6800 xt ist da natrlich kein nachteil. kurz zusammengefasst ist es ein bischen so wie das gute alte gta nur dass es eben in der zukunft spielt. das spiel bietet dabei aber so viele gute neue ideen die fast immer gut umgesetzt sind dass ich einfach nur staune. ein groes dankeschn an die spieleentwickler!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-07,"i must say i have never seen such an impressive game. its just beautiful  the atmosphere is amazing. gameplay, animation  fighting are awesome. glad i waited 2 years to llay as i havent had any glitches on my incredible steamdeck."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-06,very ordinary and boring game. technically poor graphics. low excitement. weak story. do not play the game at all. i'm disappointed
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-06,"i gave this game a second try after the release and it's the best decision i have made, wow. trust me guys, this is a masterpiece. one of the best stories i have ever played on a videogame  with a lot of endings , a lot of secondary quests that have their own story, stunning graphics, sound.. and the most important the atmosphere that night city transmits. i really hope they announce an expansion soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-06,"don't get me wrong, it's an amazing game when it comes to world aesthetics and story. but we've all heard the release bugs and issues. sure, cdpr fixed a few bugs here and there, but, they completely abandoned all roadmap for the game including multiplayer and more dlc. i didn't refund the game because i had faith cdpr wouldn't be like many other devs and abandon a flop, actually finishing it and giving their customers what they advertised for years. guess i was wrong."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-12-05,"yes, i understand that cyberpunk 2077 had technical issues at release, but, in my case, everything worked really smoothly. the plot of the game is one of the best that i ever witnessed, the overall immersion into the world was an unforgettable experience for me. i wish i hadn't play this game in order to witness the story. thanks, cd project red for such an amazing adventure."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-29,"i cancelled my preorder because of the buggy and unfinished mess that was released, but after finally getting to this game, i must say it's my favourite storyoriented rpg. this game is far from perfect in all aspects, from story to gameplay to the world in itself. but the characters and attention to detail show how much effort and love was poured into it, sadly most people will never get to experience it or look at the game without a pair of cynical lenses, and even those people who will always look at this game with disdain, it's not the talented people's fault at cdpr, it was the company forcing out an unfinished project and the gamers who got swept up in a tsunami of hype, no matter what, the game would have never lived up to such expectations. i don't know what they will do with this ip or even if the new expansion will fully change my look at the game, but as of rn, i hope they can come back to this franchise in the notsodistant future. this game is not a 10 nor 0 there are other number's you know"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-22,"i played this a year from release so alot of the glitches werent as bad, that being said i still experienced gamebreaking glitches, crashes and just general bugs. that aside i found the world to be immersive and the story was interesting. sidequests were fun, combat was repetetive but fun, cyber enhancements were cool but it was sad they didnt alter appearance that much. i loved the characters, and the voice acting was top tier. overall though, gameplay wise this game did nothing groundbreaking, just about everything in this game was good but nothing was great. i hope cdpr learn not the over promise and under deliver, most people will still have fun with this game though."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-21,"that was one of the best games i have ever played, history, climate and gameplay for me that was perfect. this game gave me great 30h of gameplay and im going to play it again with diffrent build."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-21,the city and everything to buy and loot within it is just such a wonderful place to explore when you first start up the game but it can't help but feel hollow after a few hours. the main missions are good but not great like a few side missions shine and there is definitely a feeling of great expectations weighing this title down after a horrendous launch. it's nearly 2023 when i first played it and my impressions still are unfortunately just a bit above average.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-20,"i remember once i sat and played, and i discovered that it was already 4 in the morning and it was getting light outside the window. i think this describes well how much i was drawn. but speaking in general, the game is just good, it's not some kind of masterpiece or something like that, but just a great game to take on some kind of sale"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-20,"game is in really good state now, way less bugs and glitches, new things added. wish cdpr delayed this game even more so everything would've been fixed before launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-20,"great graphics, good gameplay and good story with great characters. as i played the game this year, i wasn't exposed to any bugs or glitches and it was fun to play. after i finished the game i felt an emptiness. i just wanted to play more but it was time to let it go. i am waiting for the dlc now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-20,"un juego que en rebajas esta barato, con musica, ost y efectos de calidad dignos de cdpred, una historia muy buena, graficos increibles y el mejor en ambientacion cyberpunk. todo esto hacen de este juego el principio de un universo con miles de posibilidades gracias a su mundo abierto. pd a version 1.61, hay menos bugs que en gtav"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-16,"after many patches, the game is just great. i have played it on ps4 and yes, there si still lot of bugs, but they didnt affect the gameplay as much as at the launch. the story johhny silverhand is just best and lore of the game is fantastic, and the music, you gotta love it. you can choose any style of combat you like and the cyberupgrades can be so fun to use. but there are some bad things, for example the side quests arent the best and side jobs are repetitive after some time, but the gameplay savedit for me. at the end the game is worth it. i had so much fun playing this game. it may not be the best game out there, but still is one of my favourite games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-15,"the game still needs a lot of bug fixing because some bugs are still happening obviously in the cutscene  main story. character sometimes get stuck in the corner and nothing i can do, which force me to reload the game and replay the entire section. tposing in the cutscene still happens in patch 1.61. the bugs ruin the atmosphere that the game tries to build up. it's too hard to be serious in the story because of these bugs. also, why the game doesn't allow me to continue to play the game after finishing the main story ? it's not even a new game plus. witcher 3 has it, why doesn't this game have the same option as well ?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-15,no more words needed. the best game of all time. this is the best until cyberpunk 2 comes!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-14,"there is a moment in this game when you rescue some important npc from a warehouse where some bad guys have him kidnapped. the guy's pretty worn out, and you have to help him get to a van, where another of the important npcs is waiting for you. you get inside of the back of the van and the second npc drive you both to a safe house. both you and the npc sit in silence, awkwardly staring at each other, without saying a word for what feels like an eternity. and yes, you can skip the whole thing, but you can also not skip it and i don't understand why the game doesn't automatically skip the drive specially given that many, many other times an npc drives you somewhere the game just decides to skip the whole thing. that's this game for me. for every great moment you have an awkward and very long sit through in silence in the back of the van. i don't know if this review is going to help anybody, i don't think it will but there are like a million reviews already so who cares."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-05,great game at this moment the game is stable have a greate story amazing world.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-05,"cyberpunk ist ein ungeschliffener und hsslicher diamant. cyberpunk ist grauenvoll optimiert und hat eine oberwelt die sich nicht wirklich gut in die story eingliedert. night city fhlt sich an wie eine kulisse, deren schein dann zusammenbricht, wenn man hinter das bhnenbild schaut. die npc sind unfassbar dumm und schlecht animiert. hightech polizisten aus der zukunft kommen nicht klar damit, einen massenmrder in eine sushibar zu verfolgen. zugegeben, auch in vergleichbaren spielen wie gta konnte man die polizei durch solche wege austricksen, doch in diesem spiel wirkt das konzept des freund und helfers ein wenig unberarbeitet. eine wasserphysik ist quasi nicht vorhanden und auch das fahren mit den fahrzeugen steuert sich in keinem anderen spiel schlechter. die vielen bugs existieren noch an stellen, die so wichtig fr die story sind, das cdp dies eigentlich htte fixen mssen. die cybereffekte und flackern vieler szenen, htte man auch fr den ein oder anderen epileptischen anfall weniger entfernen knnen. die story wirkt an einem punkt unfassbar gehetzt, dass man frmlich spren kann wie den entwicklern die zeit ausging trotzdem hatte ich meinen spa mit dem spiel. und wie ich ihn hatte. in kaum einem spiel sind mir die charaktere so ans herz gewachsen wie in cp. du gehst mit ihnen durch fett und dnn, machst jede schaise mit ihnen zusammen durch und willst am ende alle glcklich machen, was  spoiler  nicht geht. auch der storyansatz und die idee hinter der geschichte sind fantastisch kreativ, wobei sie kaum ihren hhepunkt erlebt. das gameplay ist knackig die unterschiedlichen skills sind zumindest so abwechslungsreich, dass mir auch mit dem zweiten charakter nicht langweilig wurde. auerdem ist der soundtrack fantastisch und untermalt die nervenaufreibenden momente dieses spiels. die welt fhlt sich, trotz der schlechten polierung, auf eine merkwrdige art und weise lebendig an. berall gibt es logs zu lesen, sammelkram zu entdecken und verbrecher zu verkloppen. auch die oberflchliche kritik an der entwicklung unserer gesellschaft ist gut getroffen, und wirkt nicht zu sehr erzwungen. fazit cyberpunk ist nicht ansatzweise das meisterwerk zu dem ihn viele redakteure erhoben haben und nicht annhernd so schlecht, wie es zum release auf der play station war. es ist ein gutes spiel, bei dem jeder mit interesse und geeignetem pc, sorglos zugreifen kann."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-11-04,really good experience! played on ps4 30 fps capped and had no bugs when the game released in 2020! worth the 60 euros!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-30,"got this game in the preorder just to show my support for cdp red for amazing work on witcher they did, installed it and removed it after 20 mins, unplayable. revisited at 1.6 and game is much better, had a looooooot of fun playing it and in second play through with all the mods is even better. if you didn't like it in the past i strongly encourage to try again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-27,"before i start. yes, this game has a lot of bugs. yes, its performance isn't great at all. and yes, cdpr should have skipped the old console generation. besides that, this game is awesome. gunplay is by far no counter strike, cod or battlefield but it's still really fun to play. also it doesn't have to be that great. what this game is about, is the atmosphere, the characters, the dialogues, the world and the really really really good story. that's all cdpr wanted. a good story in an authentic world. and they reached their goal. play it. you won't regret it. if you love good written stories and good written dialogues in an authentic and very atmospheric world, then buy this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-26,"no matter what anyone says, game still  ultramegaass. 1.6 didn't fix the game, the  anime didn't fix the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-26,"this game is amazing, this game is incredible, a fascinating open world! engaging characters and actionpacked quests"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-26,"sure, it was a launch disaster. sure, the game was hyped beyond disbelief but couldn't lived up to it. sure, cdpr promised a lot but delivered few. but what i love about this story is that, they didn't give up. they didn't went full fallout 76 with this, they went full on no man's sky with this. i don't work in cdpr so i don't know what went down during the three years of development andor how did it go, but you can tell by the launch, something went awfully wrong. but they didn't let it put them down and let it beat them, they went straight back to work and start delivering. of course the game is not in the state which it was promised but i don't think this game reached it's peak just yet. there are still updates and new features releasing one after another and you can see cdpr is working relentlessly to get this game to it's peak. i hope, no, i know we'll see it in the very near future, not 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-21,"the truth cyberpunk is a good game, good graphics, excellent gameplay, the bad thing is the rush with which they released it, making it full of bugs, glitches, and programming errors, but i have seen that this is being fixed, something that seems good to me, i still have something for it of hope that it can be the promised game as in the advertisements."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-18,not as good as promised. the game was launched when it was not finished. the delelopers try since then to finish the game with patches but it still feels a little bit unfinished.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-10,"has the potential the be a great game for example it has a very unique and thematic artistic design of the world and everything in it and the soundtrack is awesome. the story and characters are some of the ok. the gameplay is serviceable and fun, but the loot, even though there is a lot of it, is stale and not diverse enough. the main and side quests are good and really make all of its drawbacks an extreme disappointment. now to the drawbacks like the plethora of immersion and gamebreaking bugs, that really hinder the experience and alone drop this game a point for me, especially the horrendously bad performance until they get fixed. but the moment that was the most impactful for me is the moment i realized everything is staged and the world isn't really alive. for example, npc a.i. is completely unfinished and arguably isn't even present. npcs don't react realistically to anything you do or do not react at all, all have a oneline generic toughguy response but  their pants as soon as you do anything like literally you shoot a guy in a nukeproof car with a pistol and he runs out and squats begging for mercy. the police a.i. is also nonexistent as they spawn right next to you and can't even follow you so all you have to do is run away and since they can't drive cars lol you are home free. the city, while being incredibly beautiful and painstaking detailed, is dead, because there is so little to do in it, except quests, and it doesn't react to your presence in any meaningful way. but if and when all this gets fixed i will change my score and review accordingly, which there is a high likelihood of happening, since this is cdpr we are talking about."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-08,"it could've been better. it was memed on upon release hard, got a lot of traction for being a mostly unfinished buggy mess as developers were continuously pressured to release before polish. but if you like rpgs, or are even a little bit interested in the game's unique setting, you will like this game. you can't explore a cyberpunk dystopia in any other game like you can in cyberpunk 2077. i wish it was better, i wanted there to be more, i had my own soft issues with the game, mostly surmounting to silly animation bugs and missed opportunities. but even looking back on how much i still enjoyed this game, i can't help but recommend it. they've continiously freely updated the title and have just announced their first and seemingly only major dlc expansion to the game, which i will happily be playing. i really, really enjoyed this game. even with how much 'more' it could've been, i'm happy giving my support to these developers to try and make that 'more' come true in any way possible, based on how much i already enjoyed what there is. and despite my gripes, there's still a lot. i have about 75 hours in this game, i've done two endings, and there are still sidequests and little pieces of the game i haven't found yet. i like it a lot."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-05,"while it had a very rough release, in 2022 in patch 1.6 edgerunners patch the game is very stable and runs reasonably well avg 5060fps at 1080p low settings on a 1650super. the main story is thought provoking and the side quests have so real gems. a perfect example of this is the quest sinnerman. this game is definitely worth 60 in my opinion."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-10-02,"with mod skip unskippable custscenes game is 9. on version 1.12 to 1.2 i was thinking about scores 6, 9, 7. first score 6 was due to learn what is this game about and how it works and played mostly only main mission. score 9 was given once i learned to use all those implants and rpg stuff and how menus works and grabbed all missions. score 7 was given as you could not skip unskippable sequencies and i couldnt continue how boring all those tutorials before missions are. nevertheless this review is made on version 1.6. game is simply great with mods skip unskippable custsenes and gta travel. graphics is best i have ever seen in whatever game. world is believable, streets full of dirt, different zones in cities has reason why those look like this, luxury part of town shines while narrow streets between houses can be set up for a trap... main story line presents basically everything that cyberpunk genre can offer, but took me a while till i understood and appreciated what was that about. its phenomenal what this game make you think about if you get along with your character. where he lives, what he lives for and fate of all protagonists who has no much options than to live in the night city. in that sense all choices has impact about how you think and what to think about what is happening in the game. its fantastic, nevertheless to get in to this perspective was not on first playthrough. sad is, that almost all main mission have two parts  tutorial and actual gameplay. tutorial parts take more time than actual mission and are boring and waiting till some npc moves make my nerves... its very sad, they make it that way and you can not skip it. this part downgrade overall enjoyment to unpleasent waters and you wish to turn this crap off  its really that bad. side mission also has impact and are great. some of them are even better than main story and main missions. imo what perfectly shows what this game is about is quest with paralez. whole game is about manipulation and power. nothing more to add you are simply a bad guy, you basically play as criminal and your job is to solve problems. third type of missions are what this game make game replayable the most  ncpd and gigs. those are small and short mission but have impact and gives color to the city. without those city would be rather dull and feeling of what this cyberpunk world is about would be gone. atmosphere is many times fantastic. sounds, graphics, tension  its all there. characters have their own lives, you can feel where they come from and what their intensions are. i have tried to play games with few builds and all works just fine. some feels better than others, but all are good enough to be played. netrunner is superior to most, i had most fun with fists, katanas was just fastest along with monowire. guns i have played only occasionally. there are few things that was simply bad  you can not skip cutscenes, you can only speed up some dialogs with c button. thats all. sequences in cars can not be skipped at all. many times there are places like press button to continue  i hate this in every game  for example drink and cutscene can continue... menus are what they are  there is need to learn how to work with them. sometimes you can leave with esc button, sometimes with c button. driving cars is not much fun and brings rather frustration. what irritates me most was radios  in cars music was cheap and music in the streets was ear tearing experience. why the f all radios and big repro towers plays like damages earphones or cheapest speaker from 1980? pace of game is also questionable and very slow. the game nevertheless is replayable and thanks to mod skip unskippable custsenes which make game fast 4x and you can also run this way from place to place insted of using cars of transport system, makes game 9. played oled, 5.1 surround, rtx."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-30,empty promises and an empty world. let's ignore the disastrous launch and the endless amount of bugs that they decided to release this game with. this game has promised customization which sadly there was almost none. fallout 3 had more character and skills customization than this halfdead released  world is empty and pretty ugly looking and the dialogue is not inspiring. this game is a 2010 game not a 2020 one and this is probably the product that has tarnished cd project's red reputation. will review this later when hopefully they fix this

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-29,"my original review of this game in hindsight was quite roesy. while i still gave it a low score i was willing to ignore a lot of the issues. i'm writing this review at the end of 2022 to amend that. the game has been hyped to heaven and back but you should be aware that at this time the game can be extremely buggy and an unoptimized mess. pc players can tweak things a bit but that's not what i expect from an aaa game that has been developed for as long as cb2077 has.  2 years later  we are now 2 years after launch, gave the game a try due to patch 1.6 and sadly it's still very much the same game. the open world is still boring and lifeless, ai is still beyond simplistic. no dynamic and interesting events, no car chases. nothing. they kept saying they have added a lot of dlc's to the game but for cdpr dlc  cosmetic items in game. but they keep marketing it as this awesome thing you should be excited about and mentioning how it's so great that such dlc is free.... 2 years later and cdpr is still trying to save this game with marketing instead of actually improving the game and fix basic issues with it. the levels of delusion around this game are truly baffling. people praise this game and outright lie about what is in it. they can't all be bots or cdpr employees so i'm not sure what's this phenomenon is. this game is not total  to some people but it's definitely not a good game. there are points of light in it for sure, but people tend to play them up to be more than they are. the overall game and story are still very basic and simplistic. the game recently got mod support so that will extend the life of it and maybe we will have something decent to play thanks to modders. things to know  amazing soundtrack  beautiful world  open world in name only it's a lifeless shell  rudementy ai  simple story with a lot of holes in it  boring simple side quests mostly, there are a few gems, but they are the exception not the rule  plenty of bugs and broken systems yes, even with 1.6 i'm sad for mike pondsmith and the cyberpunk series. we really thought cdpr will do it justice, but it seems all they can do is pure perfume on the pile of  they created."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-29,just a legendary game cyberpunk is one of the best games i've played. best first person tho. ultimate realistic graphics and pretty solid and brutal gameplay
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-29,i wrote a decent review before but they deleted it to raise the game overall score
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-29,"i played it again after 1 year. encountered like 35 bugs, realy polished now. had lots of fun again. impressive open world building. insane love to detail. for a video game extreme good writing and characters. 910 now for me, but you need a good pc high performance wanted still. buy it if you like rpgs and open worlds like gta, skyrim ect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-28,"honestly, it's a great game. huge, living, breathing world to get lost in. interesting stuff to find everywhere. compelling characters. great writing. its problems aren't for a lack of anything, really. it's for the presence of so much obvious scaffolding for stuff that isn'there. as a player, it's hard to experience that as anything other than disappointment  i want to experience that bit of story that was very clearly replaced last minute by this awkwardly rushed expository dialogue that explains all the things that just happened! a little longer in the kitchen and they could've easily filled in the cracks with a bit more delicacy, but many of these issues are pretty hard to fix postrelease. so that's a shame. once you accept that and immerse yourself in the world though.. wow."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-28,it has one of the best story i ever experienced finally they fixed most of the bugs and it was fun to play but you to have good system

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-28,"i waited 2 years to play this game. i was hyped like everyone else, but i still waited beacuse i wanted the best experience. i also made this metacritic account only to create this review. this game is a masterpiece and thats it! the graphics raytracing, hdr and deatils are crazy if you have a good pcmonitor, the story, the open world, the atmosphere, the facial expressions and more! of course there are still some glitches and not working mechanism like the police for example there are still no strett car chases. but which game is perfect anyway? everyone whos not playing the game because of the bad reviews is missing out!!! i played it first on a rtx 2080 super and changed to rtx 3090 with a samsung neo g7 hdr10. it was just a crazy experience. sorry for bad english also.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-28,"so many differences with launch on 2020 and now days a lot of bugs and some problems still in game but it does not really matter cause plot, atmosphere, characters are fantastic. please, play it if you have a chance!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-27,"despite the bugs and all the drama around the game, its still fun, atmospheric, replayable, sad etc. i simply love it and its sad that it ended how it ended. hope we'll see expansion or sequel one day. fingers crossed! thank you cdpr!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-27,"definitely the best recent entry into the cyberpunk universe. deus ex was always the standard for games in the cyberpunk universe, but with cyberpunk 2077, a new standard was set. the game had a bumpy launch, with much content cut from the final release. but at its core, it's got a heart of gold, with an amazing plot line. the storytelling and worldbuilding is topnotch. i never use fast travel in this game, as i just enjoy soaking in the sights and sounds of night city, while also trying to catch all the points of interest."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-27,"the game certainly had a rough start but now. almost two year after launch and played on a decent pc, it finally starts to shine. most of the nasty bugs have been ironed out. i had no crashes whatsoever. driving and exploring became more enjoyable. yes, the combat is clunky and boring. yes, the npcs and crowds are pretty much just for show. but the main storyline is good and gripping. some of the gigs are wellwriten as well. the music is toptier and very memorable. the only regret i have is that the promised multiplayer was canceled. i would have been nice to enjoy night city from a different perspective."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-26,"preordered this game on ps5. ran home after work just to finally try it out on release date. it was a mess. not by graphical or technical means. the ps4 version ran fine on ps5, except the crashes in every 10 minutes or so. also after a year we go the true ps5 version. yet why i feel misleaded, is how much they promised, how grandiose this game were shown, and what little it became. and no patch can sawe this. the story is so stripped down, you don't even feel the urge to start again, as your choices have no real difference. every time you make one, you never hear about it anymore. maybe the main story. but that also is just a fake choice. even your answers needs to be the exact same, to get the best ending. also creators are so lazy. i get it they had to cut transportation, even if they kinda advertised it, but honestly... tell me in my eyes, a game in nowdays where you drive a car, and have a wast open world you can walk in is not a joke without a working ai, that handles lamps, and make cars respect the highway code? since they decided to make the game first person only aka unable to make face animations at least i tried to feel like someone in the game, and drive how a normal person would drive. but i were the only one. pedestrians walking on red lamps, cars stopping in front of green lights, yet crashing you on red ones. cdpr wrote itself down in my eyes forever for being this money thirsty. they had the reputation of being the good guys of the game industry, yet they lied everytime, just to release this. a game told to be doomed because they had to? make previous generation versions of the game. those that just lost support for the upcoming content. content which were said to be a lot. now just one to make players shut up. i still hope one day we see a good cyberpunk game, from cdpr or someone other, but 2077 is beyond salvation for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-25,"bugs are not the real problem of this game. it's just plain boring. they can patch it all they want, but the core gameplay will remain unchanged. the fact, that only the very first story mission has any kind of branching choices will remain. the fact, that all side missions  and are nothing more than glorified fetchkill quests will remain. the fact that it's technically still 20 years away from the previews that were shown at e3 still remains. and the fact that they lied to everyone will still remain, too. this is and will always be a medicore game and it does not matter how much they patch out superficial problems. the core of this game is boring and uninspired. to fix this game, they would need to remake it from scratch. graphics 910 gameplay 410 story 310 result 510"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-23,"having played this game after patch 1.5 i feel like its a solid game with a few bugs here and there that dont really break the experience. great writing, great story, great voice acting, meaningful side missions honestly, i dont know what there isnt to like about this."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-23,"we need a new cyberpunk game, i'm impatiently waiting the dlc. everybody should play on pc. don't play on ps4 or xbox one it's new gen."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-22,"stayed away all this time as i knew at the time the hype wouldn't be delivered. put 75 hours into it since patch 1.6 and really enjoyed my time with it and only paid 12 for so money well spent. the thing is though although i really liked the story and the characters which were great the actual game play is only average with dumb enemies who just bob their heads up out of cover every 5 seconds or so. it really does feel like a great interactive movie with basic open world gameplay and features albeit it looks brilliant. almost everything else feels underdeveloped or missing entirely. playing it i was always thinking about how cool it would have been if this was in it or you could do that instead of the rudimentary gameplay that's actually there. even the quickhacking is lacking so if you play it that way as i did you'll just end up using short circuit and overheat most of the time while using cyberpsychosis on enemies for a laugh more than anything. the other hacks are mostly pointless. the driving is basic too although faster cars handle better. where are all the other motorcyclists? random events? why can't cars self drive to locations other than delamain?why can't they fly? why are trains nothing but fast travel? why are the police a joke who just stand on street corners? why isn't there more involvement with the gangs or even the police like actual quest lines ala skyrim? the list is endless for what should and could be in it however i'm still giving it an 8 as i was swept along with the main story and the main side character stories like johnny, panam, river and judy. that side of the game is a high standard as the missions are well constructed and rarely just a case of just go here and do that on your own but it's still supposed to be a game not a movie otherwise it could have been one of the best games of all time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-20,"amazing game. pc version is absolutely amazing. cd projekt red has proved again that storytelling is one of their strongest feats. with all the patches the game runs smoothly and without any glitches. during my whole play through i had only 3 moments that approached anything to a glitch. small things like the character waited too long in order to continue moving somewhere else with a script, an animation was missing no tpose, the character only stood still and during a conversation there was no animation and the mouth was not moving. get it! totally worth your money! d"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-20,i played on release one way through and put it to side cause it felt unfinished even on pc. i gave it another try with patch 1.5  1.6 and it's awesome and feels really good now. i appreciate that cdr  developers didn't gave up.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-19,"cyberpunk 2077 is clearly a game with amazingly big heart and passion in it. almost every corner of this game is filled with something interesting and i just simply can't ignore such hard work of cdpr. to be honest the best fun while playing this game i had by just doing side activities and enjoying the night city without bothering too much about anything. absorbing the atmosphere, slowly going from place to place, meeting interesting people, buying cars, clothing and houses  it's the best part of this game. but for me personally the main story was just bad... there were some awesome ideas and characters but only few. the story was short and felt shallow inside, the choices that we can make are 90 of time useless. optimalization of this game is a total nonsense... it's crushing and slowing down fps all the time even on lowest settings i don't know why. leveling system was unintelligible for me. map of the town was unreadable. crafting system ware useless. there were a ton of bugs even after patch 1.6. cyberpunk 2077 is a game that is really worth trying but it could be frustrating, irritating and annoying in terms of bugs, story and all sort of little things. but this game can also show us a beauty of storytelling, some great interactions, beautiful locations and it can just bring lot of smile at our face. i think that cyberpunk had a lot of potential but it wasn't polished enough. i'm looking forward to see it's sequel or some new stories dlcs."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-15,"overhyped game which didnt meet expectations. physics are raw, driving mechanics are one of details that give out distopia vibe. storyline is overcomplicated, yet linear."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-15,"the opening, while buggy, is still fantastic. it's one of those there's a fantastic game in here feels. only major issue is some addmitidly big animation issues and a soft lock in the skipable advanced combat training tutorial. about an hour and a half in, the game actually feels complete and play tested. hats off to cdpr for actually fixing their game. the gameplay is great, the game looks great, and now is runnable on mid level hardware average of 55 fps with dips to 25 in the main city on a 1070 with 8g ram on medium."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-14,"despite a terrible release, cyberpunk 2077 is right now an incredible game. it's main selling point is the rpg side, which is really well done. the city looks massive and realistic, the story and quest characters feel alive and seem to have feelings, the buildings and vehicles contain many details. after around 100 of playing it, it was a great experience overall and i just wanna jump back into the game after the anime edgerunners. also i can't wait for the major expansion next year !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-14,"nice game to play. nice open world and interesting main story. we were upset by the monotonous side quests with the exception of some and the bugs of the game spoiled the impression. also upset that the released version is different from the one shown to us at gamescom and e3 xbox conference. i continue to wait for the addition, and hope for the best. currently, this game deserves a subjective 710."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-13,1 first the cyberpunk that they promised and showed us is the one that got  and it was way more better and with less bugs 2 they just add some models that dose nothing to change and improve the game 3if you give feedback to cdpr they try to silence you 4the guns they made them worse then the  just just add sight and silence and mussel brake that is needed for a mod that is rare and more like that that do less then more 5the driving is slippery 6the map looks good but lacking and there is only one good place and it's after the tutorial it's the first mission map 7 legondary mod can't use them on common 8the system about the types of weapons clothes and hacks from common to legendary that only show it was made for lootboxs 9there are places like i can't sleep in them like judy apartment 10romance option is limited 11 clothes and armor you can't get the one you want it's all random and the type is random 12crafting most is random you can't get the weapon that you want unless it's from boss 13the hacking was the best but they make it more worse every time 14 perks there are bad perks and some do not work like the one that increase price weapons or clothes to sell and after some perks it stop working 15 there are bugs and they say it's fixed 16no game improvement but bug fixes and one car add dose not effect the story and some clothes and some weapons that dose not improve the game or even change the game 17 they do not want to add third person camera the most requested future 18the only good part of cyberpunk and there models and ideas is from  game is the npcs johnny sliver hand and panam and look for the looks is rita wheeler and denny's body and the mox leader body you will rarely see them except for johnny sliver hand

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-10,if we forget about all the bugs which i haven't encountered that much. the story is interesting but there is no rpg elements in the game. the only thing that you can change about the story is that it's ending.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-09,"the current rating of this game is 7.0 and i think a score of 6.5 for the current game makes more sense. however, i have hopes that i can get more from this game in the future. so i'll give it a score of 8.0"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-08,"the only way to play this game, the amount of mods that have been made has made the pc version definitive and mandatory. other than that, cdpr's decisions as to rushing the game out when promising it would release when it's ready was a humiliating disaster, and their propagandist russophobic policy has irreparably damaged the reputation of this development studio."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-09-08,"graphically the game looks fantastic and the artists truly did an amazing job of creating a wonderful city that feels alive for the most part but that is unfortunately where the positives end. when it comes to gameplay, i truly believe this is one of the worst video games ever made, ever. i just finished mafia definitive edition before jumping into my cyberpunk playthrough and i can confidently say that game, made in 2002, has better ai, gunplay, movement, pretty much anything that involves gameplay, is better in a game that was made 20 years ago and with way less bugs too. honestly, cyberpunk just feels like a graphics engine showcase and yeah the graphics look great but they maybe should've made an actual finished video game to go with it. big yikes all around."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-29,"people don't like to call this an rpg, but the builds you can make are too good where i feel it falls into the rpg genre because of that. now the game still has bugs, and it'll never have everything they said it would, but i find this game so fun that i don't care that much anymore. despite how bad this game is in comparison to what they promised, it's still in my top 10 list. that should really show how impossible it would've been for anyone to make the game they promised. maybe in a few years and if it's not on last gen it can happen, but right now it's still just a dream. the story is really good and so are the characters. the world is very immersive as long as you act the part. you are supposed to roleplay as v so when you start doing things they wouldn't do, it can break the immersion. the city is so good. the best open world i've ever seen. there's not much to interact with, but just walking around it can keep me entreated for hours."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-29,i really liked this game. the story and characters were really fun to experience. the graphics are amazing. i didn't experience any game breaking bugs so that might explain why i enjoyed it so much more compared to other people.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-29,"one of the best games i've played. it runs pretty good on pc, great graphics, great sound, great game play."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-27,"great visuals, sound and story. it's one of my favorite games so far! looking forward to patch fixing some minor glitches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-25,"this game has an amazing plot, characters, sound and atmosphere overall, but in terms of gameplay it has it's own troubles. overall if you're looking for some amazing story like red dead redemption 2, the witcher 3 or death stranding you should at least try this game! for me it's not 1010 just because of gameplay problems."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-24,"i started playing a long time after release and i didn't experience many issues. i saw a car flip into the air for no reason, that was fun. i had to clear out all enemies from an area and one of them was in the group, that was not so fun. ultimately, i enjoyed running around night city and meeting some interesting characters. i didn't much like the fps style combat and didn't feel like my character upgrades were doing much of anything. date completed 20220821 playtime 30h enjoyment 710 recommendation it's no witcher but, at this point, i think it's worth a run through."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-08-22,"i'm pc player and i really like this game i've played more than 50h . the main story imo is awesome. it's the biggest advantage of this game. most of the side quests were also really great. i can agree that the world seems to be empty after completing all quests main story and side quests, but imo most of the games looks similar. to be honest i don't understand why players blames so much this game i'm talking only about pc players. i agree that it shouldn't be released in such condition for ps."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-07-26,"the 8year long wait is finally over and it delivered a product that i'm happy to say i'm satisfied with, despite all the flaws that affect it. graphics this game's got it all. pixelperfect textures? you got it. real time raytracing? sure thing. super detailed character models? every single npc has it. cd projekt red did an amazing job coming from the witcher 3. sound love or hate cyberpunk 2077, you can't deny the fact that this game has an unmatched soundtrack. the audio fidelity is impecable and the soundtrack is as good as titles such as payday 2 or hotline miami. story it's a tale as old as time that cd projekt red writing is amazing and this time, it's no different. memorable characters, interesting events and a roller coaster of emotions from start to finish with the story, i'll even admit, i cried a river when i got to the credits. but enough horsin' around, let's adress the elephant in the room. is cyberpunk 2077 an unfinished game? no, far from it. it's an incredible experience that can be enjoyed from start to finish. does that mean that the game is polished? no. unless you have an enthusiast level pc 10700k5600x with a 3070 you're going to have to sacrifice some of those settings, that doesn't mean the game won't be enjoyable, but it will be looking worse than it should. the framerates are stable, however. once you find your sweet graphics settings spot to hit 60fps you probably won't see it dip unless you do something really extreme. there are other issues that need addressing, lods taking too long to load and dissapearing npcs are the most frequent for me, but there's plenty of other things that need fixing, hopefully, they will be in due time. cyberpunk 2077 is like an unpolished diamond. it may be rough around the edges and unpleasant to look at times, but it's still a gem."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-07-25,i waited a year for the major issues to get patched and for a sale on the game to run on my pc. runs great with 2060 nvidia gpu good frame rate performance. gameplay is fun lots of awesome music and stunning graphic design the artists deserve an award for how amazing the city design is in this game. i do wish it had more open world options like the fallout games since it does kind of force you on a linear path. i enjoyed the magic hacker system for net runner builds and endless crafting options to make your own character design. keanu reeves as johnny was super annoying they should have left that part out of the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-07-25,"i had a fantastic time with this game. it took me around 60 hours to complete and i started with patch 1.5 on pc. the negativity surrounding this game put me off from playing it for almost a year. while i had some bugs such as tposing characters and disappearing cars the overall experience was incredible. characters had depth, side missions were well written and different enough and the main story had me hooked until the end. i did not really like the skill tree, some skills felt useless and the ai was shockingly bad they kept coming one after the other and did not seem to use any tactics. what impressed me most was the city, it looked incredible and as a big fan of the original blade runner there were some days where i would just drive around at night and soak it all in while listening to the jazz radio, they really nailed the scifi vibe. i feel bad for the developers, clearly a lot of heart was put into this project, i am not sure how it ran on release on pc but can only recommend it now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-28,i diden't play the game at release instead i waited about 3 months so i did not really notice a huge amount of bugs but its far away from being as optimized as gta 5. the story plays well and has some memorable characters. the driving feels only okay. overall they probably needed another year of bug fixing and the game would have gotten less bad reviews.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-28,"it is true, there are many bugs, it is normal when a world is so big. graphically it's great, the facilities are beautiful, the lights wow. the story is interesting and lets you play it, definitely not a 10 game but for me, it's a full 8, it has entertained me for many hours and it's worth it for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-27,"revisiting my review. in 2022 you can expect a flawless playing experience with almost no bugs, with improved content and tweaks. if you buy the game now you can be sure that youll have no issues. now the question is, is the game good? in my opinion cyberpunk is the most immersive rpg ever created rivaling games like red dead redemption 2 in detail and immersion and ill explain why. consider the conversation system. most dialogue follows the traditional system we are used to where you are siting down or fixed in place while the conversation is on going. but its not always like that. there are many situations where both you and other characters can often move around while dialogue is ongoing. the game has interactions planned for most situation you can think of. unlike most rpgs characters move and express their emotions in every single conversation. animations dont seem to repeat. they pickup a cigar, eat foot, move around and drink dynamically while the conversation is going in a very believable immersive way. if you take a lot of time to continue a conversation theyll react asking you for input. in some cases if you dont respond quickly theyll act with or without your response. its hard to explain and you need to experience it to understand it. but its a clear evolution of past dialogue systems. considering the thousands of dialogue options and possible interactions this is clearly ahead most if not all rpgs created so far. regarding quests. we all know about branching paths in quests and so on. but cyberpunk takes it up a notch. im not going to give spoilers but to sum up one quest can have branches with branches and more branches of options basically covering every possible scenario the player can think of with drastically different encounters and places you explore depending on your decisions. additionally, how you approach any encounter is up to you. sure there is the typical stealth or gun blazing gameplay but with far far more options. for instance, you can use any kind of weapon you can think of. from guns of course to exotic weapons like swords or just your fists. or perhaps no combat at all. missions or quests are extremely well done with many options, many ways of completing them. i often find my self repeating a quest just to see the different outcomes. to aid in your playstyle you have thousands of perks and different skill trees of skill trees of skill trees to unlock your character abilities. you have some really well put up mini games that are far better put than the old follow the trail mini games. for instance situations where you need to investigate a crime scene for instance with a clever mini game that has several layers to it. i wont spoil it but its fun. and there are many other mini games that reward patience over just rushing it. in the streets of night city things happen all around you and you can chose to participate or not. be it one guy on the streets rambling about his religion or some gangs fighting over territory and many other dynamic events. you can gain street cred in the process. these really impacts gameplay over time. there are thousands of items littering around that you can grab and check. there are stores where you can buy food, weapons and clothes. there are bars and all sorts of places you can explore with dynamic events filling them up so exploration is never boring. there are fight clubs and all that type of content you already expect in most games like this. there are hundreds of radio stations, tv shows and news shows covering game events. also places that have no purpose to the player but are there just to set the mood of the city. you can hear thousands of conversations going around in the city and they dont repeat. they exist just to further immerse you in the world and further give you context to what is going on. the world changes as you progress in the game. night city is truly a busy city with day night cycles that completely change the tone and even the content available to you. everything is remarkably detailed with no loss of quality be it in exterior or interior environments. not like other open world games where exteriors looked good but interiors lacked detail often looking like empty rooms. this is the complete opposite. everything looks as it should in a real life apartment, hotel room, store or whatever. and the main story. you can expect a great story, with interesting characters, motivations and a high budget presentation to keep you entertained. without giving away spoilers its one hell of a ride. the game has a bit of everything for everyone. and even if you dont enjoy some aspects of it, there is no way you wont appreciate the amount of work and detail put into this game. if the game was released as it is now it would have been an instant classic. its a shame it didnt. but one thing is sure. its one of the best rpg games ever and for sure the best cyberpunk style rpg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-27,"je n'attendais rien de ce jeu, je n'ai donc pas pu tre du. les graphismes sont poustouflants si vous avez un pc pour les faire tourner, l'histoire accrochante, les personnages intressants, le gameplay dynamique, franchement j'ai pass un trs bon moment  night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-26,first of all im aware how the game looked in day one but now is a whole defrent game honestly. the story of the game is good has some flows and i'would want some more choices at the end of the game but overall was a good  1.5 version they are still some bugs here and there but nothing special or something that destroy the flow or the atmosphere i'can understand why some one hate this game but i'loved it for me is a 910 ps hope the dlc's make the game better
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-25,"the game that broke my heart. the game that made me think. the game that i will never let go. and the game i will never forgive cdpr management for. people burned themselves in creation, potencially, one of the greatest game ever made, and you just sold them for a little extra eddies right now. enjoy your little 'bonuses, kusoyarou. damn judas,"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-24,"it's a great game, visually it's one of the most beautiful games i've played, the city is crazy the quests are very well written, even the side quests it is a game that is mainly based on the story, the relationships between the characters and the evolution of v don't take it for a gta"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-23,"the game is now good. in fact it's fantastic. combat is a blast, driving is fun and the city and characters are amazing. the city is full of detail, wander around endlessly exploring or grab a double jump or charge jump and you can climb literally every building in the city and parkour around, running vaulting jumping climbing. the only thing you won't find here is a choice driven story that's as open ended as fallout new vegas or the police chases and chaos of gta. but if you enjoy a story driven exploration fps in a massive, incredible open world, it's a 1210 now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-22,"i love cdpr, the witcher saga gave me deep emotions and made me go back to video games after years spent looking for the art somewhere else. that being said, i don't think that this game is ugly it has amazing graphics, some characters are well written, but overall something important is missing the chemistry. i didn't fall in love with v. and his world, this night city, always celebrated with mouths but pretty much flat and hopeless in reality. it's not because of its violence, you can find good stories among the outcast, but the lack of depth makes most dialogue strings sound like caricatures. the characters don't interact, they just read their line and so you cannot establish a bond with them. to me, this is the major flaw, the bugs can be fixed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-22,"i know there was a lot of bugs when this game launched, so i didnt bother with it, but i really wanted to play it as it looked amazing and the kind of game i have been wanting to play for many years. was always a big fan of shadowrun and the genre in general. it appears most the bugs on the pc version has been fixed and i got it on a 50 off sale from gog. this game is absolutely amazing, runs just fine on my legion 7 with a rtx3070 and after about 20 hours i have not came across one bug or glitch or anything. i have never seen a game with so much attention to detail in the world, more so than gta v and thats saying something. the amount of cool tech, weapons, upgrades, and other rpg elements is awesome. i generally fast forward or skip cut scenes and could care less about the story but this one has me watching every minute. its just a big fun beautiful open world to explore, tons of content and stuff to do in the game. i feel like i have barley scratched the surface at 20 hours and the game still has that new feel to it as i still keep finding new fun stuff to do. thank you to the team that made this game, i know it was a rough start but as of this writing the game is a 1010, assuming you like open worldrpg games andor cyberpunk themes."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-06-06,"i am writing this review fairly late. i had played the game at release and had i been scoring the game then, my review would probably be quite different. first i will talk about my experience at launch on pc. cyberpunk 2077 released on pc with a host of bugs ranging from graphical glitches to audio bugs. there were also issues with certain quests failing to trigger as well as wonky physics, or a game corrupting issue if you crafted too many items. i didnt encounter too many of these but they were there. i wouldnt say my launch issues were any worse than say skyrim at release way back in 2011. that being said? players on last gen consoles had it way worse and cdpr even withheld review copies from press so many players werent aware of the issues until the game was in hand. they clearly knew the game wasnt ready and shipped it anyway. that alone would have been enough reason for me to knock the score down. after squandering the goodwill they had garnered with the witcher 3, they would have to play catch up and work to fix issues. patches came and went as did a roadmap with target dates which slipped by. so how is the game now in 2022 after its disastrous launch. well its still not without its issues, but it still is a great game. even playing it on pc with those issues mentioned above i could tell that there was a good game in there. its just a shame that the conversation became about the games shortcomings rather than its triumphs and the blame rests squarely on cdpr management. cyberpunk is first and foremost an rpg with shooter mechanics. you have various skill trees with points to allocate. do you want to make more of an assault type character or maybe you want to focus on a melee build with mantis blades with investment in stealth perks? maybe you want to be a net runner and specialize in quick hacks? my preferred play style was using smart optics and smart guns which turned sniper rifles into a bit of an aimbot capable of nailing enemies behind cover. where cyberpunk really excels though is world building and its character development. this city truly feels like a seedy city with factions vying for control. its writing is sharp and many of the quest lines stick with you. think of the bloody baron quest line from witcher 3. cyberpunk is chock full of detailed and interesting characters. keanu reeves of course plays johnny silverhand and i love the way they used him and his voice here. the score and music are on point as well and the song never fade away takes on a whole new meaning by the time you reach the end credits. i wont reveal more here due to spoilers. cyberpunk 2077 is a much improved game over the way it originally released. it was recently on sale for 10 during black friday. it was on sale again for a paltry 5 in apr 2022 at best buy. i cant speak to the ps4xbox one versions. i have heard they have improved, but if at all possible wait to play it on ps5series x or pick it up on pc. its been a long road and there is likely future content to come next year. if you have waited, your wait will have paid off. or you may wait for the new content in 2022. they might even bundle said new content into a definitive or complete edition like witcher 3 complete edition."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-04-03,"excellent. after 120 hours of mercenary shenanigans, conspiracies and heart aching drama alongside v and silverhand, this is one of the few games that i wish i could forget i ever played... just so that i could then play it all over again for the first time. definitely got that post game depression after this one. my ending was depressing as all hell, but also hopeful with somewhat of a cliffhanger. can't wait for the expansions! amazing characters and voice acting, especially from cherami leigh who manages to keep the cool voice and also be very expressive. in my opinion female v is absolutely the way to go. love keanu in it and the evolution of their relationship depending on your choices throughout the game. its definitely important to complete the gigs and side quests before pushing the main story, even if it seems to conflict with the idea of limited time, because johnny chippin' in with thoughts on all the crazy jobs you find yourself doing plays a part in their character development. also, as much as i enjoyed the main story, the side quests and even the gigs have great stories to them. some very memorable stuff in there. i don't usually enjoy the busy side work in games, like seemingly endless filler content, but the gigs felt like little deus ex levels. couldn't get enough of them and i loved their backstories. love this game. to me this was better than witcher 3, but i am more into cyberpunk than fantasy."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-30,this came really could be a 10 out of 10 if it launched better and with more rpg features. the world and story is one of the most immersive stories ive played in a video game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-29,game still has an abundance of quirks however the storyline is solid and the concept is excellent. witcher quality writing makes up for some of the glitches and other issues. the longer i play this game 20 hrs or so into it the more i like it. dialogue is believable and well written and the storyline is unique and interesting. its amazing how much a solid and fun storyline can save a game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-29,"a disgrace for gamers. to think that used to be gamers turned into greedy numbskull millionair suits, is uncalled for. turn in your job at this studio, and start working on something you are proud of. cyberpunk is beyond redemption. it cannot be fixed and it won't be fixed. totally  lies.. so take your millions and take a hike cd project. slaughter your hen, look at your successes, and call it a day. do us a favour."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-28,"bought the game when it first was released and didn't start playing the game till the patches, now i can say the game is much better and looks great. if you are looking for a gta upgrade this is the game, now don't get me wrong the game does need a little work here and there but just watching the amount of updates coming out to fix things means the company does care. the game is awesome the story is great this is a game people need to try."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-27,"cyberpunk 2077 is one of those amazing games that you get every once in awhile. similar to a fallout game, cyberpunk offers a giant, dense openworld with plenty of side jobs to do. other than the missions and side missions, there's not much to do other than random events. or at least, from my 15 hours of gameplay, that's all i could manage to find. however, given the open world isn't like grand theft auto, and the driving mechanics are bad, i still think the rpg elements and story are the strongest parts of the game. as i'm writing this review, i see someone saying the gunplay is clunky and unsatisfying. stealth is uninspiring. and to that i say, it's an rpg experience. the reason the gunplay is clunky is because your character isn't a trained gunman, and they need experience before they get to the point where you are running around headshotting everyone with a single bullet. but until that point, you are an untrained mercenary who is trying to reach the top. the same can also be said about the stealth mechanics. you're only as good as you make your character to be. think of an rpg like the elder scrolls, you're not going to be a master swordsman at level 1. i really want to get into this game with this review, but i also want to stay spoiler free. all i can say is that this game has already made me cry with it's story telling. if you ever have the chance to experience this, i highly recommend doing so."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-20,"revisiting review score 8.9 soo, after patch 1.5, with all the updates they made i decided to give the game another playthrough, i played as the female v, and from the beginning i wanted a playhtrough where i just go along with johnny everytime i could, and at the end try the secret ending whilst giving him my body. when it comes to the female voice acting, i liked it better than the male, idk why but it felt more real... when it comes to the immense updates, i can say that it feels different, better, but still not enough. on my first playthrough i had a couple of minor bugs, some crashes, a lot of frame drops, and a lot of those visual annoying glitches. on this second playthrough, the number of bugs went from a few to almost non existant, the only one i had 2 times, was when a blue bar showed on my monitor all the time, kinda annoying. visual glitches were nowhere to be found, performance was better even. the immersion didn't change much, this game is a lot of things, but it's not a gta, i don't feel like going around running over people or interacting with them, and when i do they still feel very robotic... with this second playthrough i also felt those shiiiiiiiiiii this was done much better in witcher 3 moments, where attention to detail was off the charts but in cyberpunk was left behind a lot of times... talking with someone like something i just did never happened, all those things that if the devs had the time, they would add some line changes and all that... this replay, gave me a better overrall experience, soo i think the new score i fair. for me, this game kinda screwed the pooch in a lot of things that won't ever be better, only if they could turn back time, and one of them would be to make two separate games... i think we became good mercs wayyyyyyyyyyyy to fast, holy  we literally make 3 missions and people already talk to us like legends... in my opinion, we should've had a first game, with no johnny, just mentions of a legendary rockerboy terrorist who died 50 years ago, and the premise of the first game would be just what they said, tto be a legendary merc, we would spend most of the game with jackie, doing all sort of crazy stuff, and by the end we would be almost legends, leaving that legendary status for the second game. in the second game,  would happen like what we got now, jackie dies and is much more emotional because we had like 50hours of game behind us with him, and we get a chip wioth johnny who was a legend and mentioned all the time in the first game... and now it's a race against time to survive... for me this would be a much better premise, but hey, it's easy to throw around our two cents after something is made.... soo yeah, overall, still a good game, a bit better even. first review score 8.7 this game could've been soo  much, this could've cemented cdpr as the absolute legends of rpgs.... after the success of the witcher, everything was set for them, their reputation was spotless, they had nothing to worry about. they should've just shut the hell up, give some updates, be honest and deliver on what they promised.... they failed in all of those tasks they talked too much gave empty updates they lied through their teeth they didn't deliver what they promised. and even then, even then, this game is a good game for, even great! holy  even with all the things above, even without talking about the bugs and poor performance, this game for me is goodgreat! for me the story was engaging, the world was alive enough altough it's alive with brainded people but ok, and beautifull. the gameplay was fun for me, i could decide different styles on which i could approach situation but nothing too crazy. now the problems  brainded ai... it's just not enough for a 2020 game sorry.  awfull performance... i know it's a very good and demanding game but my god...  no choice whatsoever  the background story doesn't chgange anything... just a lie  combat is diverse but not deep enough i recomend it if you get it for 40 bucks max. i hope they can make enough patches soo that they fix most of the core issues."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-09,"now that cyberpunk 2077 patch 1.5 is out more than a year after the game's release, i think it's time for my review. first of all i will comment that i played the game when it came out and i had to leave it because i had many bugs from the first minute. it was version 1.04. in such condition the game was a joke and unplayable. the problem is that more than a year later the game has fixed many bugs but... it's still a joke of a video game. the story is not bad, although it is not the wonder that cdpr has wanted to sell us. the best thing about the game is the city, yes, it is impressive but it is a shell, it is absolutely empty of content and activities that can be done. why create a mega city if there is very little to do afterwards apart from the missions? has cdpr ever seen or played the yakuza games? they should. then they would know what true immersion in a game is. being able to go to tons of restaurants and bars and watch your character eat and drink with even descriptions for all food and drinks. in yakuza you can play a lot of minigames and very well done and complete, there is everything karaoke, bowling, darts, arcade games, mahjong, card games, fishing, miniature car racing, pool... and much more. cyberpunk has none of this, the world is dead and has no activity. in version 1.5 they have added new apartments and in one there is a pool table, the only thing the protagonist can do is push a ball in a scripted scene!!. that's it, absolutely embarrassing and pathetic! but let's go with the action since it has been shown that the interaction with night city is practically nonexistent. all the missions consist of going to a place, killing the enemies, and so on, repeating all the time and from time to time the story progresses. the gameplay is very repetitive and ends up being very boring. artificial intelligence has improved very little, the routine of the npcs only consists of going from point a to point b and that's it. again, you should watch yakuza or red dead redemption npcs. the dialogues with the street npc's are absurd many times. the dlcs of version 1.5 bring very little, the new apartments, some jackets, a stupid look for johnny silverhand and some new cars and a couple of new weapons. oh, and finally being able to change the look of the character in the mirrors. truly very little to offer to the consumer after more than a year sewing up the tears in the game so it doesn't fall apart. after all this time this title is no longer defensible in any way, if cdpr is proud of this gaming disaster it is that they are an absolutely mediocre company."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-08,"so, let's start with the fact that you are already on my personal list of rotten companies. but they were there with a pencil, for their curve, and the chatty release of cp2077, i closed my eyes to a lot then, supported your community, sawed screenshots and various cuts. despite the fact that he was deceived by you. yes, no one cares about my personal list as an opinion, well, let them. now i will definitely circle the name in the list with a pen. continue to expose yourself to those who you have not been for a long time, i will never take products from your company again, especially on preorder. it's just that the people here are not to blame and can do nothing. exactly the same as you before the release of cp2077, don't you see the similarity. if you started to strike about the release of a raw game, you would immediately fly out of your office. it is a pity that everyone, like monkeys, picks up that heresy and repeats everything after the west. i have nothing more to add. good luck."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-08,"the negative comments are way overblown. to be fair the game was a mess at launch but the vast majority of bugs got fixed in a couple weeks on the pc version. you get a massive world, the most detailed animated faces, a decent story, good combat, rpg mechanics, and a cool cyberpunk world. in many ways it's not as good as the witcher 3, in some ways it is better. overall it's a great game, but it doesn't really have that extra punch. one big reason for that could be that the world is relatively empty and there aren't that many seemingly organic interactions save for a few not very interesting ones here and there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-08,i would have given it an 810 on release. my initial experience was mostly bug free and exceptionally fun. the recent patches and updates have given me cause to revisit the game and so far it has been flawless. i wouldn't usually take time to review a game but i heard this was getting review bombed for stupid reasons and i wanted to voice support.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-08,"i've been a gamer for over 30 years. this has been one of the best games i have ever played. after reading about how bad the game was at launch i decided to wait. i wanted to give them time to fix the game, and give myself time to get a machine capable of running at close to max graphs at 60fps. this turned out to be an excellent decision. saying the game is beautiful is a massive understatement. the level of immersion was such that i have already played through the game twice, completing all sidequests, gigs, ncpd events, etc, and i still have to fight the temptation of going back. that is over 120 hrs each playthrough. there are still the occasional bugs but their impact is minor at best. most of them come from mods i'm using and not the actual game. the level of effort put into this game is massive. the level of detail in night city is unbelievable. even the smallest sidequest has good to excellent writing and design. the game's main storyline is powerful, it tells a great story. if you play it through in one go the game will not last you more than 30 hours. but that is definitely not how you're supposed to enjoy it. you need to immerse yourself in night city. you will not want to come back out."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-02,mit dem neue update fr die next gen version macht das spiel jede menge spa. dennoch sind mir in der zeit immer mal bug aufgefallen die das spiel etwas an glanz genommen hat.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-01,"gra z fantastyczn fabu, fajnie rozbudowanymi zadaniami pobocznymi, grafika na bardzo wysokim poziomie. ocena tak wysoka, poniewa nie ogldaem adnych trailerw, zapowiedzi i nie miaem przez to wygrowanych oczekiwa i nie czuje si oszukany przez twrcw. po aktualizacje 1.5 gra jest na poziomie na ktrym powinna by w dzie premiery. gr przeszedem 2 razy udao mi si j przej ju po patchu 1.06 bez spotykania znaczcych bdw"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-01,"a very solid rpg. don't believe all the idiots complaining about bugs. they probably didn't download the new drivers. once i did that, i have hardly any bugs or glitches. nothing out of the ordinary for a game this size. the real issue is people seem to think this is supposed to be the new gta.....that is not what this is. it is a rpg through and through.  user rating of this game is tanked due to spoiled brats not understanding what they actually bought. the game is easiest the best game of 2020 for me, but i also take the time to read things, dive into the lore and story, and not just drive around and want to shoot people up. it isn't on the level of the witcher 3 for me, as some of the quests are forgettable, but overall it is still very solid."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-03-01,"this is my first game review ever in fact i made this account just to rate cyberpunk after patch 1.5, i am a huge witcher 3 fanboy and i am just going to say this about cp 2077 that it is a massive waste of time and patch 1.5 has not saved it, first thing notice is that the physics are so off putting when just walking over a dead body kicks it meters away the vehicles are the same a  a 4000 pound car won't budge if i slightly nudge in it real life cdpr! , second, why does flamboyant appearance options in the character builder even matter for a game that can only be played in first person that is just so dumb.. the npc is still so unintelligent, the npc in the witcher 3 was infinitely better, when bumping into pedestrians you phase through them and when you look back at them they don't seem to care as if nothing ever happened like you were some kind of ghost when you are in a mission and reload to the last checkpoint when you flatline there are plenty of times where you reset literally more than a minute away from where you died ,so if you die a lot of times in certain missions you waste a lot of time. melee combat looks too goofy for a game trying to be immersive, the developers loaded in two punching animations for the game, no kicks, no uppercuts, no variations everything you can see v do in first person feels so robotic. didn't even buy this game till patch 1.5 i still have a lot to get off issues with the game. i stopped playing the game when my save file for 5 hours got lost, i don't know whether it was cdpr or epic games that had an issue it doesn't matter because i don't want to play the game anymore, unless of course some massive update miraculously fixes things and saves the game probably in five years.... even then the best i would ever give this game is a 5 rating. if you value your time i recommend that you do not play this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-28,"one of the very best rpg ever made. really enjoyed 1st run, so much that right after i started 2nd run,."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-28,"cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. gameplay, difficulty, sound, story and storytelling are fantastic. cyberpunk 2077 side quests are also interesting, and the thrilling moments are enough to play the game til end. you do not need more than 30 hours!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-27,"is it an open world rpg? yes. does it actually give the player consequential choices? no. it's a linear rpg in a masterfully crafted openworld city... that is plagued with performance issues, bugs, and so on. after 1.5 i finally returned to the game and it's the most okay game i've ever played. it's not stellar, and once you get past the initial wow factor of running around the city, you end up just being ushered from one set location to another following a linear story. the rpg mechanics are okay, but nothing ground breaking. the best way to approach this game is the following are you a fan of deus ex? would you like more color and an open world with rpg looting mechanics in exchange for giving up player choice? if yes to both of those, then this will be a good fit. if however you want that player choice, you won't really find it here. if you want stuff that has player choices, play fallout, skyrim, mass effect, deus ex, or one of the many other vetted titles out there known for encouraging player choice. dark souls has more player choice than this game does. my specifications amd 2700x 32gb ddr4 4x 8gb red devil 6900xt ultimate 1tb samsung ssd lg 34 ultrawide 3440x1440 160hz freesync runs at 50150fps depending on the situation. benchmarks at an average of 95fps."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-25,probably the most disappointing game launch i have seen the game at launch was an extremely horrendous buggy mess that didn't work and now a year later it works? disappointing that i had to wait a whole year just to play the working version of this game but at least my 80 dollars i spent on this game didn't go to waste gold star for cd projekt red

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-25,"well what can i say, i was wrong about this game. it was obviously incomplete at launch and i think we can blame the cdpr executive suits for that.. it really just needed more time in the oven, about a year or longer. i am having a blast playing this, its innovative, creative and addicting. i wouldn't call it a full blown rpg but its damn near close. it features endless side missions, awesome story telling and characters, i would highly recommend giving it another chance, this is cdpr at its very best."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-23,so much good stuff here that was overshadowed by immersion breaking bugs. i have high hopes for where the game will end up after the devs clean it up and make night city feel more like it was promised. this game will probably be great someday but for now it just feels disappointing

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-23,"harsh score i know, and probably undeserving. bugs aside, this just wasn't the game we were promised. cdpr had such good faith after tw3, but it's all gone now. i expected a game of similar quality to tw3, not assassin's creed. short story, dead open world, filler gigssidequests  just not what i expect from cdpr. felt blatantly lied to choosing between nomadcorpostreet kid is totally pointless and it's still with a bitter taste in my mouth that i write this. sad."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-19,"the city feels very empty and shallow. this was supposed to be this really great openworld rpg where every choice matters, but it doesn't. even older games like yakuza, which is a totally linear game, have more alive cities than cyberpunk. when i played right after release the sound was really broken. many places didn't have background sounds at all and lost were muted. like tvs all around were so muted i couldn't hear what they said, and radio in cars was completely silent. so my experience of this game was a rather silent one with hardly any music, and that really surprised me since the music was such a vital part of the witcher. now, i don't know if they've fixed the sound problems i haven't replayed the game after i finished it. my overall view of the game is that it's pretty fun, you can kill some time with it, but definitely not the immersive experience i was expecting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-19,"cyberpunk 2077 is, to me, a huge step up in terms of graphics compared to cdprs previous hit, the witcher 3, or any open world rpg that exists to this date. even without the extra amazing stuff that is having raytracing enabled, the game looks impressive, theres no denying that. the designers who spent countless hours on creating the npcs and characters deserve a lot of praise ive taken like 300 photomode screenshots and at least 60 of those are from characters, because they look incredible and pretty unique from each other. their animations feel amazing, no lip sync issues, weird face expressions or anything like that it is something cdpr nailed with most characters in the witcher 3 as well, but it gets elevated to new standards for cp 2077great job there, period. voice acting is also great, nothing felt out of place and also the soundtrack is quite great, even though i prefer music from fantasy oriented rpgs, some of the tracks in this game are amazing, so no big complaints there. performance wise, i was lucky enough to being able to play this game with two different gpus my good old gtx 1070, and later on i managed to get an rtx 3060 ti, both paired with a ryzen 5 3600. on the gtx 1070 it was not possible to achieve stable 60 fps at all times even at medium settings, and i believe cdpr failed to make it clear that the official system specs for the game are aimed for 30 fps, and not even that, because a gtx 1060 is not doing 30 fps at high settings, at all times, in this game, its just not happening. on the rtx 3060 ti the game finally runs pretty well, even with rt effects enabled, but since its an open world, there are places where the fps will dip below 60 and even below 50, especially in really crowded areas where the rt lighting effects over npcs clothes and stuff gets too taxing. no big deal, because luckily the whole game doesnt take place in these places, and its pretty varied, with zones exceeding 80 fps with rt ultra settings too, at 1080p and of course always with dlss, which looks and works great in this game. nowby the sound of this review so far, this is a great game, isnt it? no, its not. it is not a terrible game either, but its not what it couldve been. for starters, this is the kind of game i had to spend two hours fighting the keybinds and controls, because i remap a lot of keys being left handed and we cannot remap keys like f, enter, or use the arrow keys the .xml config file can be manually edited, but its a laborious process as it contains a lot of actions linked to the same keys, its a pain, honestly. this felt unacceptable for me on a triple a game in this time and year, it just makes me have a very bad opinion right from the very first minute, and to this day it hasnt been patched to improve it in this aspect, which is sad. there are also lots of quality of life features that cdpr managed to patch into the witcher 3, like a better inventory system, or even crafting, that in cp 2077 are so terribly implemented that it hurts a prime example of this is our phone browsing contacts, which arent even organized alphabetically, is a pain, and one would think that in 2077 phones could work better than a fossil from the presmartphone era from 2004only, they dont, because stupid design choices i guess. then there are bugsa lot of them, most are non game breaking and are small rough edges that shouldnt have been missed in qc, but if the qa testing team missed, or were ignored, for stuff like the really bad keybinds in the game, im not surprised this game has a ton of small bugs and random glitches, not at all, for whatever reason. the storylastly, i liked it, it has several endings or paths at the end, depending on certain choices, quite similar to the witcher 3 here, and it left me with some mysteries and questions unanswered while other matters were quite settled. i didnt hate it, the story, mostly also because the important characters are well written and you end up caring a lot for them, and that leaves me quite satisfied.  edit  patch 1.5, feb. 2022 the game has improved quite a lot, although i still feel it has room to improve, and certain keybinds are still hardcoded, but it's much better for sure, now, therefore bumping the score to 8 seems fair, from my original 710. update 1.5 has been great so far, and i hope they continue elevating the quality of this game more and more."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-19,"i played this game in the second half of 2021 and it was quige good experience, but not marvelous. for me it was 7,510. but now, when the game is update to version 1.5 it is simply amazing. definitely the best game i played for last few years. i give 1010 even if there is still a few little bugs."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-16,"really enjoyed this game. i thought the story was fun and very interesting. definetely a memorable story. the gameplay was good for the most part. i wish they included more weapons that do different things and different types of quickhacks. at times, it just felt like i was going mission to mission guns blazing without really much of any variety. the music is fantastic for this game. bugs are pretty uncommon for me, especially after patch 1.5. despite the gameplay being a bit lackluster, i do think this game is worth a try, and i personally really enjoyed it, especially its story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-16,"i am not a psycho fan, but for me the game was great. played near its premiere and i really didnt experienced many bugs as everyone says. story for me was brilliant, maybe too short but i still enjoyed every moment of it. most of the side quests are brilliant and some of them are really wrote as if they were part of main plot. gameplay for me was great because you can fight however you want to and i always enjoy that type of games. i wasnt struggling with fps but i dont have the worst rig so its not what should be judged by me. but really didnt experienced that many bugs as everyone say. it had as many bugs as any game i ever played. some may occur but really not that big of an issue. one thing i am most happy about is how immersive the world is. soundtrack makes you feel depending on a situation like a badass or as if it was most emotional moment of your life. definitely soundtrack is amazing 1110. but yeah immersion showed by this game was the best i have ever witnessed."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-16,"patch 1.5 releases and fixes quite a few issues the game faced at launch, and while people want to commend them for this. i just don't. the game still has bugs, glitches, and performance issues after this patch, and i find it difficult to praise cdpr for an update 14 months after launch that still does not make the game complete andor polished. the problem with a game like this is that we spent the majority of the decade hyping it up and impatiently waiting for it to release while our expectations skyrocketed and never came back down, couple that with the turbulent development period of almost 9 years apparently and an advertising campaign that rivals, or beats, some of the biggest releases of all time, and you end up with a product that is set up to fail. i thoroughly enjoyed this game for the roughly 40 hours i spent in it, but i will not glance over the fact that many people could not, the console releases and lowerend computers have been an absolute failure on cdprs behalf, and i find it completely unacceptable when companies make promises and break them. this game had 9 years of development time and is effectively only playable on pc with high end hardware, and even then there are serious issues. bugs. call a damn exterminator level bugs. this is not early access, this is not a beta test, this is barely even a damn zygote at the moment of conception. the game simply should not have been launched in this condition, this is the kind of thing that gives game companies a bad reputation and it sticks with cdpr from here on out now. from cars inside the ground, tposing drivers, hdr blackouts, and characters that can't move their mouths, to cars falling from the sky, being unable to uncrouch, and subtitles that stay on the screen forever, any bug you have ever witnessed can be found in this game. i am a huge fallout fan, and i can safely say that bethesda makes less buggygames than cdpr now... put simply by mr. miyamoto a rushed game is forever bad, a delayed game is eventually good. gamewise, there's a lot to like, there are some emphasis on some really well designed bits of night city that make it a joy to take in, lots of neon lights, holoprojections, and cybermodded characters that look really great, there are a great assortment of weapons and perks to personalize your character, and i certainly enjoyed the sizeable array of vehicles made available to the player. i think cdpr did a nice job in creating a city, but when it is filled with lifeless ai, randomly spawning police, minimal interior exploration, regurgitated eventquests, the same damn character model every 10 meters seriously is this gta 3?, and phallic items all over the place, it starts to lose its luster. although... landfills, waste runoff, lifeless ai citizens, hyperpolarization in wealth... probably will be la in 50 years, so i guess it's honest. the story has some good and bad, but i would lean more towards the good side, there's a lot of fun moments to be had and lots of quests i thoroughly enjoyed, and i liked the relationships friends and romantical along the way as they felt genuine and added some much needed personality to the characters, but i wasn't a fan of how it all wrapped up, to each their own i guess. rpg elements are kind of hit and miss, mostly miss. your lifepath? means nothing, it gives you a few unique dialogue options throughout and changes the opening cinematic. i wouldn't care if they didn't make such a big deal out of it. choices? not too many that reverberate through time to come back and make a difference. character builds? while they can be unique, the perk points amount to being able to hack this or that, open said door or gate, or in a few rare instances, solve a sidequest quicker, nothing else.  new ip in a stagnant industry  grandiose city  fun character interactions  story has its moments  aesthetics are well done overall  dlss implementation is topnotch  way too many bugs  a few key binding options missing  bullet sponge enemies on higher difficulties  rpg elements are not great  lifeless city  awful optimization across the board  v's male voice actor is bad  ai can be temperamental overall, i think this game could be an 810 without the bugs, but because of said bugsglitches, poor optimization, and a lot of broken promises around certain features, this game is a solid 7 for me. this will certainly make me look at cdpr differently, this game felt more like watchdogs than i would like it too. it is a shame that people will not get to experience the good parts of this game because of all the surface level issues, but in all honesty, i cannot blame them for the 36 scores."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-03,"i am an absolute  for metaphors and cyberpunk 2077 delivers some great ones. ignoring the train wreck of a launch, cyberpunk 2077 is a diamond in the rough. cd projekt red made a game with such strong visuals that are incredibly stunning with a dark and realistic tone in some advertisements, with oversexualization of women being prominent in these many of these ads. cyberpunk 2077's world has a ginormous amount of backstory that intrigues you to dive even deeper and learn more. music. cyberpunk 2077 has got you. the sheer amount of music on the in game radio along with the remarkable soundtrack is amazing. above all, the story elevates this game to another level with some endings making you reevaluate your existence. the side stories even feel as though they are just part of the main story, captivating you into more characters. it's overwhelming how much there is to talk about."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-02-03,"if cd project red's devteam had been given the opportunity to actually finish this game and not have their higherups lie through their teeth about the game's state of development, planned features and crunch, i believe cyberpunk 2077 could have been one of the defining games of this generation. as it is, the 1.31 version i played was functional, with a relative minimum of bugs and crashes, though far from zero. it's a game i would have paid for. there's not much i can tell you about the game you haven't already heard. put short, it's a visually striking title with truly excellent voice acting and facial animations, supported by a reasonably entertaining, if wildly unbalanced combat system that overwhelmingly favors firearms and revolvers in particular, and passable driving physics. it has openended character progression if not equal effectiveness of character builds, a robust character creator though not a lot of opportunities to view said character, a lot of nods to the tabletop game's lore and other cyberpunk fiction, a trans character who simply exists as a person without that being a central and exploited aspect of their writing, and honestly some of the coolest vehicle designs i've seen in a game. and of course, keanu reeves delights with his portrayal of series mainstay johnny silverhand, a complex and compelling character that is at once terrorist and freedom fighter,  and capable of personal growth. cherami leigh, who i knew and loved as gaige in the borderlands series, acts her heart out right back as the female version of protagonist v. it is undeniably buggy, however, though perhaps less so from the  i'd heard about at launch. i saw the occasional floating car, tposing character, randomly exploding piles of papers and garbage, duplicated civilian models, ungrabbable items though never an exceptionally rare item and characters clipping into walls and disappearing, and so on and yes, these could and did happen in the middle of otherwise poignant scripted scenes. i encountered no issues with corrupted save files however, and only two fatal crashes, both of which i believe were tied to the monowire weapon, specifically when trying to block and counterattack with it. i was warned that the mantis blades weapon would also cause crashes, but had no issues with either that or the gorilla arms. the enemy ai, especially that of the cops, is indeed laughable, but i can't fairly say that it detracted from my enjoyment. i've also heard an argument that cp77 isn't actually a very good example of cyperpunk as a genre, and i'm not sure i'm educated enough to comment on that. aesthetically i think it hits the marks, but in terms of its writing, the central narrative is largely about saving one's own skin, though you are given ample opportunities to help or hinder others along the way. there is notably very little the protagonist can do, or even to express an interest in, bettering the quality of life in night city as a whole, so much as simply trying to survive it, this conflict being central to johnny silverhand's character and his past failings. as far as dystopic fiction in general goes however, night city as presented is a successful artist's rendering of one of the most nightmarish postcapitalist hellscapes i've seen, a place where people are murdered in the dozens by the day, the police are privatelyowned, triggerhappy and ultimately lousy at their jobs, proper medical care is restricted to the uberrich, some people have to eat of garbage cans to survive and corporations act completely outside the bounds of law, tact, morality or common decency. in other words, an environment not far removed from the america we know today only we don't have the cool and useful cybernetic augmentations to ease our transition into corpofascistinduced societal collapse. i'd seen what i'd needed to of cyberpunk's combat mechanics about 2530 hours in, but the sheer amount of side content padded the game out far beyond that i think i was closing in on 100 hours by the time the credits rolled. it's an immense game, and much like other titles of this nature maybe too much so for it's own good. it's mechanics really don't hold the game up for that long. cp77 has no less then four layers of missions the central story chain and side jobs as in many other games, but then the gigs and ncpd contracts, the latter of which offer no story whatsoever and are simply a means of gaining experience and items. and you will need to do nearly every one of these encounters to reach the game's level cap of 50. if you adhere to the admittedly dated and questionable hour per dollar metric  value, cp77 certainly delivers on that score. i can't recommend buying cp77, but i also can't say it isn't worth playing. i can only say it's a shame its publisher did not act in good faith."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-24,"i've deliberately waited a year after release to play this so that the game get more patches and the bugs get ironed out. and honestly, i've enjoyed every moment greatly. took me around 110 hours to do everything and it is clear they put a lot of work, love and soul into game. and yes, there are still bugs. most can be ignored, some are immersionbreaking, and one of them was gamebreaking. the gamebreaking bug i experienced was the instant police warrant on sight without doing anything. it happened only in a particular area of the city. i was able to fix it by using a mod, thankfully. night city looks incredible, never seen so much detail to everything. every single little alley has so many details added to it. soundtrack and radio stations are great and they perfectly represent the vibes the cyberpunk genre is supposed to give off. very satisfying progress system with various perk and bonus rewards. you can really specialize in a particular build, and you feel very powerful. my build was handguns with cold blood. there are three types of missions main story missions, side jobs and gigs. the main story is very good, actionpacked, plenty of twists. extremely short, too. but unfortunately, there aren't a lot of choices to be made. there are some choices regarding your dialogue lines, but this is no detroit become human. side jobs are surprisingly good, a lot of them are indistinguishable from the main quests, a lot of thought has been put into them. the gigs are your typical steal an item or kill a guy quests. they have a little bit of story and background. most of my time play was spent doing these gigs. gameplay definitely has a lot of replay value. there are different type of weapons, with different playstyles. and if guns aren't your thing, you can choose to be a hacker build. all in all, cyberpunk 2077 is a great rpg,  loved it. to me, it lived up to expectations. i love the world and the lore. here's hoping they will release some storybased dlc. perhaps a sequel in the far future. there is a lot of potential with this ip."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-12,"i've only played this since patch 1.31 pc but i have to say, i enjoyed the absolute f out of it. the world, the characters, the stories, the music, the voicing... i am hooked. i had stayed away from this for nearly a year because of the controversy i don't know if that was the right or wrong decision because i don't know what the game was like prior to patch 1.31, but a friend gifted it to me, told me to play it, and i'm very glad i did. sure, in the 180 hours i've invested across two playthroughs i have encountered a few bugs. things like audio lines missing praise be to subtitles!, optional objectives not completing, cars hovering in the air etc. but nothing that i'd call gamebreaking perhaps immersionbreaking though, however i've not experienced anything that's taken enjoyment out of the game. to be honest i find most of these small bugs amusing. i think this game is once of the best storydriven experiences i've ever had and i've played the everliving heck out of all the mass effect games, right up there with the goats. a game that hooks you into caring about the characters as much as this one does, is something very special. it's not perfect, absolutely not, but it's still very special. one thing i will say is that i went into this game blind  i hadn't seen any trailers, i didn't take part in any of the hype, so i personally don't know what was promised and then not delivered. but it's a really solid game that, with a bit more polish, i think will easily be one of the best storydriven games out there."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-11,i like it more than witcher 3. it would be forever early access like no mans sky huge imagination projects game was overhyped  but no overpriced. bugs wasn't biggest problem after release its something similar to development of mass effect andromeda  to much tech features  less soul. a specially  k. reeves face could play character more usual for him even minor or should be in some long dlc. there is still chance level up system  witcher was worse but could be more hack and slashmount and blade game. a specially there is no world reset. maybe with mods snipers and revolvers are so op. my second character used miniguns and shotguns but they are weak. too short main campaign. alternate choices  i dont know it was worth. more comfortable would be to choose beetween angry and calm answers and reputation stats. cars are pretending acceleration like fast and furious i dont like it a specially when car isnt accelerating or fps drop limits speed.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-02,"922  5.000 resultados de traduo you know that story that there would be more than 1000 npc's, all with their own daily routines and all that? bullet. npcs have virtually nonexistent ai and express no sign that they actually have a routine. either they wander aimlessly in the streets until they are abducted by an unknown force and disappear into midair, or they remain stationary forever in their predefined locations. remember the supposedly deepcomplex relationships with the characters and a range of possibilities to explore? guess what they're not there. you can count on your fingers the silverhand's metallic hand these very rare interactions. it would be comical, if it weren't tragic, that the effort you make to create some romantic bond, or friendship at all, with an npc is useless because he doesn't even have half a dozen dialogues enabled, let alone interactions, tours or whatever. you can't even change the color of the clothes or anything like that. the stores have very few pieces to buy, and they are very expensive. you will basically find yourself forced to use loot drops throughout the game due to the disproportionate price and the tiersrarity system that makes you change them constantly. there is no separation of combat gear and clothing it's all the same. the worst thing is that it's not even worth investing in your character's look due to the firstperson camera in the greatest flying camera style, which in itself is tawdry enough due to mediocre physics and why it doesn't make sense. i will explain why. it doesn't matter if you only dress in a pair of piercing underwear, a two billion dollar suit or like a juggernaut the npc's will treat you the same nutty and generic way. forget any kind of situation where you wear some faction x clothing would create enmity or problems for your character for frequenting faction y territory, or something like that. this kind of influence and weight is nonexistent. i'll repeat it for emphasis nonexistent. even gta sa held more weight in this regard because, when you frequented enemy territory, there was a constant danger of being shot at, here in cyberpunk 2077, not even that happens. it's even incongruous for you to walk around with a jacket with arasaka's logo on the back and no one lets out a peep! not even the damn silverhand complains about it!!! another point, incomprehensible, is the fact that the attribute values of clothesequipment are not even linked to their appearance andor material. the laws of physics simply do not exist in this universe. newton and company turn in their graves in disgust. imagine there is an epic tier suit that grants you 50pts of armor while armored vests of the same tier give you 25pts and a silk dress gives you 55pts ie zero likelihood. you saw the trailers and thought that life as a badass mercenary, completing contracts, accumulating money, respect and influence would open up a sea of possibilities for you to flaunt, didn't you? ledo deception young grasshopper. a mistake. can you believe that in a game like this you can't... buy housesapartments!? and that the very few extra locations you unlock are just through quests? and that after being conquered, you can't even change the interior decoration? and that there isn't some kind of dealership or something similar where you can buy new vehicles? do you know why you'll be carrying out several missions in an attempt to accumulate your hardearned little eggs? for nothing, basically. you can't buy new cars, only used cars that are listed one by one after you progress through the game. or when completing certain quests. and no you can't customize the color, plate, interior, rim, or whatever of your snapper. can't even change the color of the car!!! not even in 2007 that happened! maybe until the 70s of this millennium they will add these options. but... night city has loads of things to explore and activities to do, isn't that right uncle infante!? ehh... no. there is not. you are not encouraged to go looking for activities to do because they don't even exist. most buildings have doors that are, in theory, interactable, but none can be opened. all locked. it's such a false sense of freedom. the world is big and well built, with lots of details and a good graphic, but that's about it. no amusement parks, no virtual reality adventures, no video games, no mini games, no puzzles, no binge drinking. a sea of possibilities thrown down the drain. finally physics. ah, the physics. i lack adjectives to express how crap the game's physics are, in particular our beloved generic v. i'm wrong, but that's the kind of thing that doesn't go away. it's miserable to look at the v's shadow as he runs. it's horrible! it's not even funny, it's just really bad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2022-01-01,"cyberpunk 2077 had fallen well in covid period as a nice illustration of dystopian reality, it is seen in the game, it is seen in the contemporary world the story part is excellent and the storytelling mastery seen in witcher 3 can be clearly seen together with excellent acting of voice actors. there is quite a lot of content to explore, in terms of ambiance and media graphics, music, sounds the world is rich and varied. most places are quite unique. it is a way to visit blade runnerish city and its different flavours, including mad maxish, fallout like vibes. the disadvantage is that quite many of those places are dead ends, the decorative doors and buildings not accessible to player are numerous, what is somehow a pity for such big gameworld. another issue is with npcs while we can regularly stumble upon those scripted npcs talking between themselves, i had quite often the feeling that night city is filled with very rudimentary ai bots in the way i have never experienced in witcher 3, which seemed much more alive there are no dialogues with random npcs and they have very basic routines, giving an artificial feel. as for quests they are linear mostly, and the player's impact on the gameworld is quite insignificant, despite the recurrent theme of leaving the mark on the night city, that is exposed in the game lore and story, still the writing of individual quests is very good and worth following despite that linearity, deeply in the cyberpunk vibe. one can admit the gameplay is less fluid than the one in gta v especially for vehicles part, the races for example are laughable but still, cp2077 is supposed to be rather crpg game than action adventure, but it succeeds more as a latter. actually the simulated content is of bad quality, while scripted one has an exceptional quality and that explains my score for that game. the character development schema is in state of art, together with skills evolution enforced by player's play style skills increase levels when they are often used and quite a lot of customization that can be done on weapons and clothes and such craft system, yet the random loot somehow renders all that irrelevant, since just playing forward and leveling we gradually get better and better gear without much need for any crafting. the fighting ingame with different enemies is fun enough. last but not least the bugs  they are everywhere and they diminish the pleasure of gameplay while being immerged in the gameworld, still they get fixed gradually though still a shame that unfinished game has been rushed out on market to increase shareholders value. i suppose that undercooked parts, such as police system, the unscripted part of empty gameworld will not improve much in future except for modders work maybe, that seems to be supported by cdp red ?, still for scripted storytelling alone the game is worth to be played and enjoyed. all in all it is a must play for all cyberpunk ambiance fans that liked blade runner movie or observer game, even if the game has weaker parts, especially those similar to gta v gameplay together with other polish game in similar setting, the observer, that game is worthy sf content."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-12-23,"the game is unfinished and you can see it. at the start, playing with a pc, i could not pass it due to many technical problems and bugs. but in a hurry i returned to it already on the series s, and realized that it was really good. this is an original story, not a remake  remaster, a quality plot and characters, great environment design. the developers did their best and the game is not worth a hate in their direction and it is really interesting to play it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-12-22,well the game is good good gameplay good story good rpg but i play it after moths from it releases and there were some bugs but i enjoyed it not like hoverfield  knowen as battlefield
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-12-22,"its hard to talk about cyberpunk out of context. it was what felt like the most hyped game ever at the time of release and one of the hardest disappointments and pr disasters in the industry shortly after. but even if the bold and dishonest advertisements are ignored, the game doesnt even leave up to the expectations it sets itself. right from the start, the character creation menu greets you confidently by presenting a lot of choices in your appearance and a choice of the background. really enticing! but the former choices turn out to be quite slim, while the latter one doesnt really contribute much throughout your playthrough. and the letdowns dont end there. everything, from the quality of quests to the progression systems, from the driving to how rich the city environment you drive through is, ultimately fails to deliver on the first impression it makes. everything you engage with sooner or later turns out to be much shallower than expected, undercooked, or just broken. for me, the biggest disappointment was the equipment. in itself, its a system that inspires you to get into a certain look, follow a cool style direction, cherish your newfound awesome guns  up to the point when you realize its a looter shooter, so guns last for about an hour, while armor stat of your clothes makes no sense and if you play to win, youll soon look like a clownhobo hybrid, flexing a versace blazer on top of your grandmothers boxers. and things dont get better when the equipment comes in contact with other systems i was the most excited in the game by quite a margin when i finally managed to buy the doublejump implant, but it turns out that theres not much to do on the rooftops theyre usually quite ugly and the game doesnt consider them to be an important part of your exploration. a letdown again. and its like with the doublejump thing throughout the whole game cyberpunk invites you to make your own way, but its really only ready to support a narrow, expected playstyle. it wants you to do its missions, to go through locations within a certain path it nudges you into. a safe path. the one where night city looks good, its citizens feel alive and things dont break as much. you cant choose your own adventure, you have to play vs. and vs story together with johnny silverhand isnt bad at all, its one of the strongest parts of the game, but i feel like letting you experience it in a more linear, controlled, and directed way, as the game clearly wants you to anyway, would be a better decision than to put up a flimsy facade of an uninspired, broken and dead open world. music is cool, tho. and so is art direction, and some qualityoflife features. people clearly worked hard at the game and i dont want to rob them of their due credit. they just lacked the time and, unfortunately, the vision. and even cdpr is still able to provide the former, i dont see how they could redeem themselves for not having the latter."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-12-20,"started with almost no expectations. pros  great atmosphere. i read the paper rpg and imagined many times how night city would look like  the game's rendition of a dystopian future is detailed and superb. some scenes are as if blade runner or altered carbon came to life.  great art design. i'm a  for retrofuturism, and the neonlook of the game's environment, cars, etc. delivers.  interesting and thoughtful story. important if you power through only the main storyline you will miss 8090 of the narrative content, as, indeed, many side jobs reveal much more than the main storyline. so play the side missions. you will feel rewarded. kudos to the writing team.  keanu reeves is yo wingman. while one can debate his dramatic acting chops he delivers the loudmouth, egoistic,  rocker johnny silverhand perfectly. also lets not forget about the rest of the cast, who all deliver memorable characters.  great soundtrack. i'm a  for electronic and industrial music, too.  interesting, i prefer this game to the witcher. dunno why, both are bleak in their own right.  cdpr at least gave some mod support and brought the modders on board which is a sane decision. cons  bugs. they are really annoying, even on pc. they break the immersion which is a pity in a game building so much on the atmosphere.  limited clothing customisation options. the generated npcs through the city wear more interesting stuff than the player character.  release given the buggy state of the game, had i preordered the game at full price i would have been pissed, too. if the game had been released a year later and without bugs, it would be considered as one of the great games of the decade. such a shame. i bought the game for 40 and i consider it a good investment. would give it 8 or 9 on the content, but the bugs and the release bring it down to a 7. if they iron out the glitches, build solid mod support, and add in dlcs in the future i would say this game still could be one that sets benchmarks in the future. respect to mike pondsmith and r. talsorian games for the original game! all of us knows cyberpsychosis will be a thing, i mean people are already going insane from looking at social media on a screen  so what will happen when twitter will be wired directly into your brain?...."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-12-09,this game is right up there with hades for the best game to come out in 2020. what an experience! visually and aesthetically this game is one of the greatest marvels i have ever witnessed in an openworld style of game. the combat is fluid and snappy and feels satisfying to execute. the main story is solid all the way though with good voice acting. the side quests are incredible and actually bolster the main story quite a bit. this game is meant to be savored and really encourages you to explore and find out what you want to find out about night city. i think a lot of people frowning on this game are taking things a little far. i think people expected the game to be some sort of gta? i know 90 of people playing on pc at the very least like the game and you can see that reflected on steam reviews. i enjoy this amazing dying lightcrackdown? type of game with rpg elements. as far as pc goes the bugs aren't even bad and most being common types of openworld game bugs we see in basically all aaa titles. i can see why people playing on last gen might not be that happy although i have been told good things about the xbox one x running it but i also remember when games were coming out for the xbox 360 and crappier versions were coming out for ps2 still like tony hawks project 8. at least when you get these versions you get another copy for next gen along with it at no extra cost. i think cd project red did a great job with the pressure they were under and the expectations everyone had. at the end of the day....seeing a bunch of adults cry about a game they didnt care about or buy is pretty sad. you can tell who has actually played it. they may complain about some bugs especially people on last gen but even under the worst conditions they arent going to hate this. there is just way to much about this game not to like. what a really cool and ambitious title. 9.510

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-12-07,"this game was 7 years in development, with 3 delays, and a whole year post launch to patch. what the patches have done is minimal to barely noticable. in terms of bugs, i still got tposing npcs and cutscenes, characters mouths not moving in dialogue, textures not loading on npcs, causing invisible legs the very first npc i encountered on the bar stool as a streetkid had this after trying it again. i knew this was still lame from the get go the police system fix is still laughable, where when you commit a crime a drone spawns in off screen roughly 50m away to spot you and you're instantly wanted. every now and then a police officer or 2 just spawns in, and only if you stand still like a pleb would you ever get caughtoverwhelmed. but even if this game was technically perfect with no bugs, the mechanics themselves still functionally fall flat from it's very core, the combat. the cyberpunk roleplay game frank made in the day had some real effort into balistics. what caliber fired from what gun was extremely vital, with body armour properties also having a very real effect on absorbing and blocking those rounds. in this game theres no attempt at simulation like this, it's binary and boring as hell. they basically ripped off the destinylooter shooter style where what gun you're using is useless. only the flat stat attached to it. so if you run into a militech rifle at level 10 shockingly early and easy to accomplish, it's damage will become irrelevant by the time you hit level 15 and pick up some janky crap everyday street revolver. because it's all based on the flat dps stat. and that stat is tied to your level in the game. basically level scaling every item in the game. this creates a crap sense of immersion when good weapons you bought get outclassed by bad ones you can just pick up off common gangsters when you out level it. the fact they advertised this as an rpg, based off a tabletop rpg, then changed it to action adventure to get around how little role playing there is and how call of dutyised they made it at the last minute is nothing but fraud in my eyes."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-29,"beautiful game with intriguing story held back by technical issues. this is after 20 hours of gameplay and a year from initial release with some major patches applied. cyberpunk is a very enjoyable and engaging open world rpg with shooterlooter mechanics. this is hands down the best looking game i have ever played. better than rdr2, forza horizon 5, metro exodus. the story is great even if you're choice of path in the beginning doesn't change much it is very immersive and has different outcomes determined by your choices. think of a more modern gtav set in a nearish semidystopian future. yeah sounds cool huh? everyone knows about the launch and i will give you my first hand experience. first i have not run into any game breaking bugs but there are smallannoying glitches bugs frequent enough to pull me from full immersion and knocks the score down from 8 or 9 to 7. now every vast open world game i have ever played has bugs and glitches i.e. skyrim, assassins creed, even gta. the main bugs i have come across are graphical like flashing textures, items not being able to be picked up, and audio glitches such as voice lines not being spoken or continuing when skipped. not huge things but immersion breaking and annoying."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-29,"honestly it doesnt deserve most of the hate it gets, the last gen version was unplayable though so i had to wait to play the game til i got series x in january. so with that said, the game isnt even as close to buggy as it was on last gen consoles, ive experienced very little while playing on my series x. the game is much fun once you get the hang of things, lots to do, and explore, a good story, not on red dead redemption 2 story level of good but close in my opinion, and gameplay is so much fun, fast paced and intense with background music that makes you feel badass while in combat, the music themes in this game are so good and fit well with each parts of the story. and the endings, which ive only played through one ending as of now, and i chose to raid arasaka tower by myself, which was very hard to do, but rewarding and made me feel like john wick. im not going to spoil anything if anyone is reading this so ill just leave it to this, each of the endings will leave you feeling sadempty, at least thats how i felt. the game is fun, fast paced, and exhilarating outside of some few bugs. the only thing i dont like about the game are the driving and fighting, outside of those, the game is fine and play able. but if you havent played it yet, and youre deciding to give it a try, than id say go for it, dont let others opinion on the game form your own, you might like it, you might not, its not as bad as people are making it out to be in my opinionunless your still on last gen."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-29,"this is a good game but it will be remembered by it's terrible state at launch especially on last gen consoles ps4  xbox one,one year later most things were fixed. now let's talk actually about the game itself not it's technical side. it's a classic modern open world game with a mix of things from fallout,watch dogs,gta set in a futuristic dystopian city. it's not something revolutionary but it's really a good written game with a brilliant story,excellent written characters and plenty of content."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-26,"the game is incredible. the world, atmosphere, and characters are amazing. combat is very engaging, it gives many options you can deal with enemies. you can fight as meele or range, you can use envirorment to sneak past your foes or hack multiple objects the world is filled with. also the way you level your v can open new options of completing your tasks. i would give it a 10 but... there are still many little bugs innthe game. sometimes they can be funny but overall it's not causing any big problems. and the second con is a lack of these small things that would make the world complete. first example i could think of is a arcade machine game with roach from witcher, i would like to see that as a playable simple game. maybe some other mini game i could play with npc, car tuning. cyberpunk has a lot to offer, but on the other hand there is sometimes that feeling, that there could be more goodness that would make this game 1010."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-25,"cyperpunk 2077 is awesome game as of today 150 hrs i bought it without any expectations. i never read what the studio promised or said the game would do. i just like scfi , deus ex games and i have always been intrigued by cyberpunk 2077 for me this game is up there with gta5, rdr2, witcher3 and mass effect. games that i consider the best of the best. the game grabs attention with its gritty, dark and rough world of cyberpunk. the game music composer marcin przybyowicz is absolute virtuoso. his music will stay with me for a very long time. i have spent over 150 hours playing this game and the more i play it the more i like it. the game is absolute behemoth because there is just so much to do in there. i have read here and watched some youtube videos with people complaining about ai in cyberpunk but to me there is not much difference between ai in this game and witcher 3. yes there are some weird stuff here and there but i think this has to do more with being a bug than being a bad ai. people complain about driving mechanics saying that they are somewhat not as good as in gta5 but i see no difference. to me some people just had such unrealistic expectations about this game that now they cannot enjoy this really solid aaa title. the game story is interesting. there are moments in my first 15 hours which surprised me and i thought to myself wow, this is very cool stuff. from technical point of view this is state of the art with cutting edge visuals that requires latest rtx and rx hardware to experience it to the fullest. it seems to me that there are some people are really sore that their hardware cannot handle the game as they expected. to them i will say tough luck. you want next gen visuals and smooth frame rates then it is time to upgrade to next gen hardware. the game needs good hardware to enjoy the visuals to the fullest. this game made me upgrade my pc from amd 3600  5500xt 8gb to amd 5800x  3060ti. red dead redemption 2 should have been wake up for all of us. it is going to get tougher on old hardware in next few years as developers will spend more time developing games for the latest pc hardware and new consoles. there are some bugs in the game and again some people just over dramatize saying that the game is infested with bugs. this is simply not true. i am 80 hours in the game and i have encountered few bugs like people walking through walls or some people standing on top of a car but nothing that i would consider major. nonetheless it would be great to see cdpr to address those issues. in summery cyberpunk is good game. it is solid 9 out of 10 for me and i will be glad to bump up the score to 10 once the bugs are fixed and ai is improved. cyberpunk 2077 is another special gem from cd projekt red. i am looking forward to explore night city with my first character and then replay it again and experience the game with other characters and do everything that this game has to offer."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-25,"i didn't see bug as much as everyone. it seems it is better than launching. only one side mission stucked actually it is not soo important for me. i can recommend it without any pressure. story 1010 it is short but it gave the message it want. i love it. gameplay 910 you can play how you want. if you want to be a cyber ninja, you can. if you want a war machine, you can. if you want a hacker, you can. open world 910 night city is perfect. driving car while night is amazing. you can see too many side missions. some side missions are really good, some side missions are only ''go kill himher'' or ''go take this files''. do or don't it is your option. graphics 910 optimization 610 i played it from geforce now and as i said i didn't see too many bugs. but of course i can't ignore other people's problems. i hope they fix it soon as they can."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-18,"while the game still has technical issues and bug even more than one year after launch, i gave the game a second try after refunding it in the beginning, and if you take the time to complete the lengthy intro which might not seem like an intro to you, it really  me in and i just finished it. when compared to the beginning many annoying visual and gameplay bugs were gone and performance on 34401440 with everything maxed and dlss on quality worked out perfectly  making the visuals of the game the most beautiful ones i have yet seen. also the story and world are really really addictive. so yes, while cdpr fed the release and made false promises, the game is still a masterpiece in my opinion  so give it a decent 5  10  hour chance."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-17,despite everything its a good game full of bugs the story is not bad though it lacks rpg choices but the soundtrack its just brilliant and the map is very well made it has the best textures i've ever seen and overall and as i said despite everything they promised i don't think they under delivered just wasn't truly honest about the state of the game. i just hope the dlc can bring back to life this game because it had and has potential

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-15,better than all this trash in 20202021. game has really good history and attractive cyberpunk world. the main problem of the game is player's expectations which was raised by marketing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-15,"the game has its problem, but the story, atmosphere, city, characters, relationships makes you want more and more. this world is addictive and makes you think about life and meaning of it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-15,i can say that i am lucky and i didn't encountered a lot of game breaking bugs or crashes but i still encounter them and a lot of other people. the game itself its amazing the story is an ez 1010 but there are right now too many problems. i recommend buying this game after some patches because like i said earlier the game is simply amazing. but i will give it a 7 for now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-15,still better than gta trilogy definitive edition. still better than gta trilogy definitive edition. still better than gta trilogy definitive edition.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-15,"they messed up bad, we thought cd projekt was god but apparently not, it . the game could have been 1010 but now it just feels like an unfinished product. it had some really good new ideas, the graphics and the level of detail is 1010, i also liked the combat and the story it was a bit too short, it had interesting side stories. still no additional content 1 year after release only smaller patches development of this game is a disaster sadly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-15,"an absolute masterpiece. gorgeous graphics, fun gameplay, amazing voice acting, the best game world ever created and its a blast to play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,"bug and bugs and bugs. story is mediocre at best and the characters are forgettable. they tried really hard to make everyone so extreme that they had the personality of a mountain dew commercial. the ui for the menus are absolute trash and the customization options go hard on things that you don't really care about. not to mention, if you care about stats, your character will be walking around in outfits that look like they were picked out by a group of 4 year olds. combat is clunky not witcher 3 clunky but still and the world is not as interesting as the game tries to make it look. i have had more fun playing average games than this so that is why it gets a 3. did i mention the bugs? luckily, i was able to get a refund so no hard feelings to cd project red. but the game is meh with a side of bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,"it's one of the best games i've played, its story is beautiful, and its world is the best i've seen in all of the games"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,nothing new. nothing as promised. only poor people who give this game a 10 can only afford 1 game a year....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,"simply the best game atmosphere ever. atmosphere 1010 night city is truly a masterpiece of a city. it provides an atmosphere you've never witnessed in any other game before, particularly during night. the city is dense, with many vehicles on the streets could be more on the highway and a lot of people walking around, although there is almost no interaction between npcs unfortunately. every part of the city is filled with extreme detail and the lighting is stellar, especially with raytracing enabled. 1010 without a doubt. storyside quests 810 halfway through the main quest flow, the story is good and you definitely want to see what's coming next. side quests range from boring to very fun to play. overall, i like the quests in gta more as they offer more versatile and crazy tasks. aside from the opening, the three life paths have very little effect on the game. i expected many sidequests exclusively to every life path that deal with the background of v and cover the the respective life path in depth e.g. corporate rivalry, nomad rivalry. this is quite disappointing to me. ai 610 the ai is mixed. neutral npcs, when shot, sometimes do not run away or leave their car and crouch forever. police always spawns out of nowhere when doing some criminal activity e.g. shooting a random npc which is awful and has to be fixed. enemies however seem to have very little issues so far, but they are nothing special either. they hide and shoot, throw grenades, hack your mind and sometimes rush to your hiding position. that's it. some of them have a bug and act like a scarecrow, standing there with arms stretched out and doing nothing. some enemies with fists only do not attack you and just try to defend your punches. both effects are rather rare though. gameplay 810 this is an unpopular opinion, but the gun play feels good and is realistic. you cannot shoot an enemy precisely in the head from middistance without using the sight or scope. this should be the way to go for games that aim at mimicking realistic gameplay. firing weapons sounds amazing and is a lot of fun. there are a bunch of different melee and rangeweapons, grenades and skills to level. adding the hacking abilities gives a versatile playing style. more weapon modifications and specialeffects would be welcomed though. driving feels terrible once you start the game as steering overshoots compared to other games, which leads to too much drifting. after a few hours of gameplay however, you are used to it and driving also makes a lot of fun, especially with fast cars and during night. other negative aspects  characterstyling options are too few. you cannot set the height and weight of v and there also too few options for hairstyle, skin color, hair color etc.  clothing if you want to dress with the best items, you most likely look like a clown. cdpr should implement clothing that better fits to each other.  craftloot crafting is nothing you are very excited for. loot is okay, but you'd be more hyped for a boss if weapons of higher rarity had unique special effects.  other tasks in night city become repetitive quite fast  difficulty sometimes the game is too easy even on the hardest mode. those are all, if at all, minor points. bugs yes there are bugs, and there are a lot of them, which cannot be all listed here. many of them are minor bugs that occur very infrequently e.g. npc having a gun sticking in their head or others moving weirdly, but summed together, there are still too many of them. more often however are... ... textures of cars not loading fast enough which obviously dampens the atmosphere. ...cars and npcs suddenly spawning out of nowhere. ...cars spawning inside other cars, causing some mixture of an explosion and a crash and making cars jump 3 meters in the air...??? but that bug seems to be very rare at least. ...sometimes clicking q to change from first to thirdperson while driving is delayed or bugged. overall, the game is very much recommended, at least on pc with good hardware. what makes the game special and possibly the game best ever is not the interaction with its open world but the atmosphere and stories. you will most likely exceed 100 hours of gameplay. if cdpr removes the bugs, the game is an easy 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,"cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece for me that i loved, even though it was really disappointing in some ways. i didn't encounter almost any bugs throughout the game, the number of bugs i saw was very small and it was said to be uncomfortable, so lower your expectations before you start the game so you can enjoy the game a lot more. 95"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,"unpolished game. weak support. spectacular work of designers and story writes. huge drama of expectations. as aftermath i can say it's still one of the best action rpg of last 5 years. does it make this game something i can recommend for everyone? hell no. does i enjoyed this game  absolutely. i'm a fan of gits, matrix, neuromant and other early cyberpunk fictions. and this game worth every dollar for me, as extremely rare product. i don't want shadowrun cyberpunk elves. i wanted cyberpunk stories of people. and that's what i got."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-14,"i just have to support this game either way i could, even though cyberpunk have got a lot of technical issues it is still a great game with characters which can touch feelings which feels real, and interesting world. the game provide experience youll never find anywhere else."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-13,"the publisher cdpr lied and decived millions of gamers when their ceo stated that it runs surprisingly well on consoles right before release while simultaneously not allowing any reviewers to examine the console performance. this resulted in now an infamous case study of how not to launch a game. the publisher is intermittently patching the game well after release, but it is still highly suboptimal and doesn't contain 12 of what was promised in the total propaganda of the marketing before relase. total disaster. wait until 2023 or 2024 and buy this game on a huge discount, if ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-13,"ah yes, the pinacle of pc gaming. i enjoy playing the game. after finishing the main story and getting 2 different endings i ended up wanting more. my pc at the time could run the game at stable 40fps. but i'm waiting to get a better rig to give it another shot. the game has almost 0 post game content, and the npcs and choices seem lack luster."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-10,"i am half a year after ending the title and still puzzled what the game should get from me. let me start it off with with graphics. you need a pc in price of a lambo to even enjoy it so better leave it that. but for real i played the game on my 1000euro laptop that is used to gaming and it flopped. game barely got 40fps on low with  everything. many graphical and badly loaded graphics, with you just cant put on weak pc. if two textures are overlapping each other i would rather say bad optimisingprogramming than weak pc. but the it didnt really was an issue bc... city . you come into night city. you are amazed. you start wandering. you discover its a shell of a city. the thing i had my hopes so up just flopped like that. city itself is pretty but you would love to just do more there. i dont expect to enter every single doors in the game, but you should be able fe to rob some house a thug. to invade and kill someone as part of random quest. to steal something and so on. and yet there are barely none of those thing outside the mainside missions. no optional content like that to make you feel like you are making your way in the undergound of a night city. second issue for me was all biotech. i mean this should be integral part  in my opinion and it just falls flat and lets you boost numbers here and there. simple example  there are now real benefits of mantis blades. you buy it for a ton of money and they . you need to build whole tree for them to make it make sense. while in the real world you would buy them, 'cus they would automaticly boost your build with nececerry skills. they woud have fe some motors to make a powerfull enemey even from a weakling. next one is not enaugh future content. yes you get braindance and biotech. but those are almost not integral to the gameplay. hacking is nice addition but its not that nicely made in my opinion. the best kind of a future content for me was braindance itself and dolls brothel. it shows you this wicked ways the world coud go into. oh and i should not forgett the corsairs... plot  its original. the biggest issue here is.... you get this feeling of the game suddenly quickening right after festival. you put 1 to 1 and you come to the conclusion that developer had no time whatsoever to do everything that he wanted for ever the reason. and that reflects in the endings... which i dont want to spoil so i will say are just not that for that kind . i could go on and on about the bad and good sides of the game.... but i feel like you can get the wrong idea here. its not brilliant game but its still a good game with its problems. i think if the team would not come to the clearly many problems form time pressure to kinda small team the game would end up as a pearl and easy 1010. everyone and me is actually covering the game from what they wanted it to be, and not what it is, which is kinda a good review in a way, 'cuz everyone seen what this game could heve been putten right time and ppl into work. i am opting to weak 7 on it myself, as i enjoyed my time there and put 50 happy h in main and side content not doing everything."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-06,"this is a game with no heart and soul, the shooting mechanics are boring as hell, the ui of the inventory and upgrades are complex and uninspiring, the driving and police mechanics are worse than gta 3. i player for 3 hours and got absolutely bored out of my mind. you wanna play a better game? play zelda botw or metroid dread, this is plain hyped trash"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-02,"false advertising, 90 of advertised features are either missing or wildly overexaggerated. hacking and stealth is a massive waste of time. skill tree is a cluttered mess with most improvements giving just a number increase here or there. crafting is yet another cluttered mess. driving feels bad and npc ai is jarring. enemy ai is just as bad. wanted system is a joke. nudity is included expand"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-11-02,"this game has many bugs or glitch but the the developers made an effort too much and they are still continuing to improve the game.i played 3 times,it has a beautiful open world,very good story and you can do whatever you want in the world.i know the developers suffered a lot before the release game. they couldn't add any drm protection for us.they are working too much.please respect them."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-30,"this game is absolute dog  even 25 year old games deliver better expierience than this dumpster fire. for example driver 1 released 1999 has better car, chasing, and driving mechanics than this pile of  gta5 released 2013 is a thousand times better in every regard than this game from hell. your character is a vampire without a reflection in mirrors, pedestrians are brainless zombies walking in circles, police forces are spawning out of nowhere, and they have cut about 80 of the content that has been promised to the playerbase. ea, activisionblizzard, konami, take two, ubisoft, bethesda and now cd project red joins the group of , antiplayer, cashgrabbing, group of absolute fail developers. like the other up the list, i wiill never, never ever, never buy a game from this developer again! i just hope you go bankrupt and your stock goes to 0 where it belongs you deciever. this game is a gamers worst nightmare period."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-30,"wow. just completed the story. i have no words. the game is just amazing, very good story, nice sounds and a beautiful map. i didn't experience any major bugs after all those patches. i highly recommend buying. you will not regret that experience"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-29,"the game is of low quality, with average gameplay and prohibitively high system requirements. issued a refund. i do not recommend buying it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-29,one of the best games iv ever played. really hope that cdproject solves their problems and gave us the sequel
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-29,real rpg game not like skyrim. i like how the world was created in this game. lots of interesting quests with interesting characters.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-28,"first single player game for a 10 years which really immerse me. i'm not a cdpr fan, i didn't play any witcher longer than 1h, but in cp77 i have 230 hours in steam atm. waiting for dlcs stronger than the birthday"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-27,"the story is really fascinating and narrative, there is a lot of gameplay of the game and a lot of different missions and an exciting plot. what else is needed for a big openworld game is this game and the story of a youth scenario and a lot of side stories."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-27,"one of the greatest games i've ever played. just tried it on my mid range pc with update 1.31. open world rpgs are not without some funny glitches here and there but it's miles better on pc compared to consoles. the game was made to be played on pc. it's shame that console users are down voting this game here. it has become a fashion to bash it. storyline is exactly what you expect from a cd projekt game. visuals are on next level. one of the best level designs i've ever seen. it's better version of deus ex human revolution set in open and immersive world. i don't think this game could've worked in any other genre other than being an open world rpg. replay value is very good. it's longer than witcher 2 and shorter than witcher 3. it gives you decent number of hours to enjoy but doesn't overstay its welcome at the same time. meanwhile it also leaves you wanting more. a game that even lets you develop bond with your pistol can't be poor. i'd say it's vampire the masquerade bloodlines of this gen. that became a cult classic despite having a rough launch. actually the said game was in much worse form. cp2077 is in a lot better in shape. will definitely play the game again once inevitable enhanced edition comes out sometime next year perhaps. the game definitely deserves a relaunch. however, i don't recommend waiting for that long. buy and play. it's brilliant."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-27,"almost a year has passed, but no changes! version for bettesters! nothing will ever change in this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-26,"post patching, this is an excellent game, so don't miss out on all the fun it offers as it stands now versus its unfortunate release. i played 90 plus hours on a regular xb1 and the game only froze once. plus there are multiple endings, which is awesome. the story is solid, the graphics and environment are sweet, the voice acting is excellent, and you get to hang with keeanu reeves as the rebel johnny silverhand. i love action rpg's and this one did not disappoint."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-25,"hi all. cyberpunk 2077 was probably one of the most anticipated games of several  far i have spent more than 80 hours in it, at the moment, namely the patch 1.1. 12 i'll start with the pros of the game. it has a very high quality story. almost every character that you will meet along the way the story is welldescribed and evoke some kind of emotion. the game is full of varied gameplay for many hours of play,the story fits very well into cyberpunk atmosphere and intrigues you till the end. the story has a nonlinear, combat system. the game has a huge variety of weapons, from melee to clever homing. and the game itself is very atmospheric and emotional i enjoy it to the fullest."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-24,"i am glad that today the game is great and is played well for me. the story justifies its staging and a lot of time in an openworld game, yes the game is flawed and has bugs, but the story, plot, and overall vision is a masterpiece. i heard that the game will be redesigned .thoroughly in the future and as i know they keep their word."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-24,"the game had very bad release with a lot of bugs but the graphic, music and story are great and the game is definitely worth playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-24,"the best game  exploring fascinating topis, no important bugs, revolutionary approach to npc and dialogues, both of which are naturalistic and interesting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-24,i have enjoyed the game it was a good experience except for the bugs every other thing was good.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-24,"this is the only good game of this genre in 2020  2021, where you can adequately play in the big world and a normal story. i've already played for 30 hours without even particularly affecting the main quest. the game is addictive, fashionable, youthful, beautiful, stylish, everything you need for a good  soundtrack is given 10 points."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-23,"very happy for the many patches, interviews from the developers and the goal to overhaul the game and modernize it . today this game is played decently and well. no problems or glitches for me. the story is written is great. lots of game time and secondary missions."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-22,cool more that the game will be completely revised as i'm still deep in dozens of hours of play. the gameplay justifies this purchase and i hope for a remaster of the game from the developers.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-21,"i finally got myself to play the game this month, i've been hyped for this game since i saw the tease trailer back in 2013. i never even believed the game would come out and thought that the hope of ever playing it was just a pipe dream. and to be fair it probably would have been for the better if it just hadn't been made. looking back i feel very betrayed by the developers, cdproject red was a studio that still had an ounce of respect in the gaming industry, however it is clear now that they just manipulated and deceived their audience to make some quick cash. during the development of the game the developers kept gradually hyping the game out, promising features that never made it into the game and making it seem like this was gonna be a game of the century, the new skyrim of games. throughout the development of the game there have been countless trailers made showcasing different aspects of the game as well as how the game would generally play, what i was expecting of the game was to be a massive open world with countless interactions, different factions waring against each other, turf wars between gangs etc. i was expecting to see v come from being a nobody and eventually climbing the ranks of the clangangcorp they joined up with and helping them whilst experiencing a storyline of their own. this brings me to the point that the story is  the lifepaths do not matter at all, they are essentially just a choose your own tutorial. the game tries to make it seem like they give you the option to progress through your lifepath and then choose the ending based on it but it's just not enough and they feel like a gimmick. during most of the time with a few exceptions you will feel like you are playing the street kid path because that's just what you do in the city, you complete jobs from fixers for different people or gangs and get paid for it. you don't get to be a corpo rat working for a corporation at all if you choose that lifepath and while there is some nomad gameplay, it isn't the major focus of the game. i don't want to go too in depth on the story as to not spoil anything but trust me when i say it fails in every aspect of story telling and it felt too short and too linear for what i expected from it. to add to all this, pretty much none of the gangs or orgs in the game feel consequential the game barely tells you anything about them and you almost never directly work with any of them. now as for the gameplay, the game essentially gives you a choice of a few classes. you can basically either be a stealthy hacker, a gun wielding maniac of your choice pistol, shotgun, rifles, a samuraininja with blades and katanas or a paladin with a blunt weapon. the game does kind of hint at the original pen and paper cyberpunk classes but mostly with npcs fitting those classes like cop, fixer, rockerboy, media, corporate etc. v basically gets a choice of solo, netrunner and some techie stuff. as for weapons, the only thing is that there doesn't seem to be too much variety and a very weak customization. the game is essentially a looter shooter where you sometimes collect x ammounts of the same gun that you already have just with a different stat so you can sell it or dismantle it. the ai you fight is sometimes dumb as a rock and it just makes the gameplay feel very weak and unrefined. as for the city i was expecting it to be bigger, when i initially saw it in the reveals i was saying to myself that it is kind of small. the devs said that its because the city is also very vertical and you can explore different levels of the same place which kind of assured me but turned out to be a complete fabrication. there are just way too many issues with the game and the things that we were expecting from the developers are not there. there is no vehicle customization, weapon customization like skins and differnet mods aside from the scope and muzzle you can put on, you cannot customize your character at all after you start the game, no races aside from 4 side story quests, you cant ride public transport, you cant buy different houses, the relationships in the game are meaningless outside of the side stories for those characters and the ending of the game. i could go on and on but to sum up this game is just an overhyped mess that puts shame on the cyberpunk genre and should have never been released in this state. to add the cherry on top, i didn't even mention the bugs. i didn't want to talk about them here too much because i don't believe they are the main reason why this game is so bad but rather a distraction form the real issues however the fact that i lost my entire manual save file of the completed game because i started a new character and the old file got deleted on it's own by the new ones is just a joke. that's all. don't play this junk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-21,"played on pc , with patch 1.2 and endend the game tried two different endings , completed lots of subquest but not 100 completition...i'm not an 100 player type. i enjoyed the game. it's isn't perfect but it entertain. good awesome music, good characters, lots of cyberpunk 2020 pen and paper rpg references night city looks and feel like nigth city sourcebook from 1988, great keanu, good stealth sections, fast hacking, good visuals, great city locations, entertaining melee and hand to hand combat, some unexpected good and fresh minor quests, iconic cyberware, some tough moral choices, has cyberpunk rpg grim and gray area style. bad no real variety between classes both in gameplay and endings and quests, unrefined firefights, a little tedious crafting system, mandatory open world, some bugs not game  still, slow first half of the game, few interactions with city pedastrians and shops, few cutscenes, some lore could use some more introductions and explanations towards people who aren't cyberpunk rpg fans. i was a player of cyberpunk 2020 in the 80's and i find here a good game. i'm an old guy and an old gamer so i'm not easilly suprised  here i find some side missions, some endings and some dialogues that surprised me...like sinnerman."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-20,"tldr review  final score  7.8 good indepth review spoiler free  visuals  810 visually speaking cyberpunk is... well... breathtaking. on pc i haven't come across the same poor optimization as lastgen consoles and honestly, the game runs much smoother than i anticipated. night city is beautifully crafted. it feels organic and alive, driving around and exploring everything it has to offer is a blast. something which i rarely do in games is taking screenshots, but cyberpunk looks so good and has such a great screenshot tool that even i felt compelled to take some photos, if you love screenshots, you will love to do it in this game. gameplay  710 from a gameplay perspective, i was a tiny bit disappointed by the quite generic fps and stealth the game offers, the game does try to fix these problems by introducing some mechanics such as hacking and smart guns, but even though they are fresh after some hours the feeling of far cry's 3 stealth and shooting starts creeping up on you. the abilities are many to choose from and you could experiment a lot with classes and playstyles, even though i don't think a determined class is necessary to finish the game. i played on the hard difficulty and didn't decide on a specific class to play as i just chose what abilities made sense to me at the time. before release, i thought cyberpunk would be a true rpg and i would be able to play as the person i chose to be, but in reality that is far from the case, you play as v the merc, and even though you can choose what v thinks you will never feel as if you are v. the roleplaying elements are rather weak in my opinion and i expected more from it based on all the trailers and prerelease info we had. now let's talk about the dreaded bugs. yes, the game is very buggy, but in my experience never encountered any game braking ones, it does make the game feels unpolished, and that is because the game is very unpolished, i have over 1.000 hours in skyrim so i can overlook harmless bugs, but if you hate bugs you should probably wait for some patches. story  810 the game's main storyline i could only consider as good enough. there is nothing mindblowing about it and is interesting enough for you to want to finish it. i liked how jhonny's character could oppose your thinking depending on the dialog you chose, but i really disliked how when the turning point of the story comes, he just accepts whatever you choose. i just feel like the story could have been so much more, the cyberpunk genre and theme has so many possibilities to explore and i just feel as if they didn't put enough effort to write something better which we know they can since the witcher 3 has amazing writing. in my opinion, where the game really shines is on side quests and side characters, just as in the witcher 3, the side quest are an absolute blast, even gigs which are more like miniquests can get quite interesting. for me the best side quests are the ones where we get to know better the side characters, they are all great characters and offer hours of fun to the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-19,"amazing game,! blade runner  at the maximum, with characters registered at the level of the third witcher. many thanks to the editors and voice actors! ................ go!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-18,an amazing cool story for 50 or more hours of play. i am very happy for the constant patches and additions to the game. consider this product as the best in recent years in the gaming industry for pc.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-18,great game with an amazing story and soundtrack. i personally got hundreds of hours of fun out of it. characters are great and there are a ton of subtle player choices. it also has an amazing modding community. i'm glad i bought it on release and played it without being aware of the controversy around the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-18,it's great game. some minor bugs but it's ok. graphics are true next gen with rtx
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-17,"when the game came out i was super hyped and gave it a thumbs up, after 160 hours i must say this game is a huge disappointment, the city although visually impressive feels like something made for the ps1, ai is a joke, game physics are a joke and of course place is littered with bugs, overall the game feels unfinished, story and side quests are really fun and there is a lot to do but though the game has huge potential is nothing even close to what we were all promised, if you have not bought this game yet do yourself a favor and wait for at least 1 year and a half when maybe it will be ready, after doing most of what can be done in the game i am left with a bitter taste of what it could have been and regret that i did not wait for the game to be completed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-17,"overall a very poorly designed game, it feels like every single featureaspect is rushed and incomplete. give it at least a few more years of patches for it to come out of alpha stage and it might just be complete. even then i'd temper my expectations a lot since the base gameplay is mediocre at best  even if it hadn't been riddled with technical issues. what a shame."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-12,a good diverse game with a cool scenario and awesome cool missions for hundreds of hours of one game. i'm happy with this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-11,"my review of cyberpunk 2077 can be summed up in this statement. cyberpunk 2077 is a gorgeous generic fps. i wasn't one of the people that was super hyped for this game, but i did pick it up on launch day for pc. a mixture of liking cdpr's other games, and generally just needing something to play lead me to do so. after investing over 50 hours in the game i feel that my opinion is more or less finalized on the game. first of all let's tackle the good. the moment to moment gameplay is fun and gets that itch for a shooter scratched. melee combat isn't perfect, but it can still be fun slicing up enemies wildly. driving was a pleasant surprise as the vehicles handle really well. and finally the dialogue and story is fun to follow, and you feel an attachment to some characters. now to the bad, or more just disappointing. night city is beautiful, and has so much potential to be a fantastic place to explore, but it doesn't live up to that potential. the city is empty with nothing to do. the vast majority of buildings are locked and have no interaction with the player. if you ever get tired of shooting bad guys the game doesn't offer you any other distractions to clear your pallet. the citizens of night city are also lifeless and do nothing other than coward at the slightest thing out of the norm. don't expect them to get angry and retaliate against you, or do anything else but curl into a ball on the ground until they fade from existence. shops are sprinkled lightly across the map, but don't really feel different from one another besides the two shops at your apartment which have side quests tied to them. the rpg mechanics in the game feel almost like an afterthought since they have very little impact on the actual gameplay besides stat increases. levels and stats act like a barrier stopping you from interacting with parts of the game you shouldn't be until later. feels more like an invisible wall than it does rpg. dialogue options don't really change the outcome of quests, and are much more there just for flavor. finally i don't want to spend too much time on this, and it doesn't really change my score at all, but the glitches and bugs at launch are pretty bad. textures not loading, clipping, ai standing still, the list goes on. i have no doubts that they will be ironed out eventually by cdpr, but my issues mostly stem with things they can't patch. all in all this game is a generic fps with a coat of rpg on top set in an interesting world. worth playing if you have nothing else and just wanna blast some bad guys. 70100."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-11,"all in all, a pretty solid game with lots of interesting mechanics, which unfortunately aren't all explained very well which was a problem with witcher 3, in my opinion. aside from the comical bugs that happen every now and then, and the general confusion i had whenever interacting with takemura, the game was a lot of fun and the story was fairly enjoyable. its easy to accidentally pour a few hours into the game when you don't intend on it, as you start picking up random sidejobs because they're right around the corner, or there's an assault in progress you can quickly take care of, etc. the performance is a little spotty at times, but it's not horrid. some of the critique of capitalism is a little bit on the nose and hyperbolic at times, but it gets the message across well enough. if you're diehard proamerica, you'll probably hate this game, as it casts the us in a fairly negative light not undeservingly. in short, good game. kinda wonky, but still a good game, worth picking up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-09,"disaster,probably the worst game i have play on my live... comming when is ready lol..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-08,"my biggest gripe with this game is the narrative. the main story is way too short and moves from point to point way too fast. outside the side quests for your possible romances, there aren't really any other interesting ones. 75 of my play through was just boring busywork visiting every single gig and ncpd scanner events in the hopes of finding something interesting... i did not. the game is an open world looter shooter and not an rpg."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-05,"overall a great game. yes, not without jambs at least at the start in the form of npc animation, some combination of textures, not entirely successful selection of voice actors, etc. but this is the same solid product as the witcher 3 wild hunt, although the games are not similar in many ways, but the quality of performance, plot, colorful and charismatic characters are at the same level. i recommend it to all lovers of good games, as well as the atmosphere of cyberpunk. 10 samurai out of 10"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-04,what hasn't been said? this game is buggy and even if there weren't any bugs the story isn't that good in the first place.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-03,great game. didnt entcounter any gamebreaking bugs during my playthrough. both main story and side quest were mind blowing

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-10-02,"gameplay is out of this world. shooting, jumping, sliding, killing, it is almost perfect. the world is also very beautiful. the story is half baked, there are no real choices, no real way to create your own story, the gear is lackluster, as all of the other secondary systems police, gangs, and all rpg mechanisms. this is fun actiong, fps game. not very good rpg game. and yes, i bought it for 20 euros and it was worth it. i would never buy it for more, it's just not there."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-26,"magnificent, confident and loaded with content that other games do not offer. such is the action blast called cyberpunk 2077. all the expectations were more than"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-26,"very disappointing. graphics are ok but the engine is poorly optimized. you can clearly see that they tried hard to get raytracing into the game for no apparent reason and forgot about other more important things on the way. like gameplay for example. or the promised nextgen open world. as others already pointed out the world is empty and nonresponsive. witcher 3 did way better in that regard. rdr2 is closer to what i would consider nextgen open world. they didn't even try with cyberpunk 2077. driving physics , especially the motor bikes. gps is not working properly, changes routes while you're going, switches objectives on the way for no reason, etc. distance to quests is not shown in the journal, wtf?! bugs everywhere, npcs glitching through walls, bodies flying around... one of the funniest things i've ever seen are the traffic lights that switch to green when you're approaching in a car even when they just switched to red because implementing logic for stopping and waiting is so difficult, it's actually nextnextgen. and thank you very much for taking the time to implement a fcking p3nis designer with pubic hair styles and bell end tattoos and what not instead of making the basic game loop work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-26,i personally loved the atmosphere and the 80s  90s sifi vide. loved the romance options and the story in general. i have over 200 hrs into the game and haven't gotten boerd yet. i know this game gets alot of  bc of glitches but release bugs are a normal thing and i never had  breakinghappen. this was one of the few games i've ever preordered and for me it was well worth it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-26,"after some months i had to return to my review and change it considerably. after delving deeper into the story, gameplay and mechanics i have to admit it had the makings of a legendary game but because of the lack of polish and glitches it fell short of that and just became a very very good gam maybe even a game of the year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-25,"good game, not bad at all. but not good as the witcher or gta if you like farcry or watchdogs you can enjoy this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-23,"it's a decent game, i wasn't even following the hype but i'm still a bit disappointed. the setting is amazing, night city is one of the prettiest and most intriguing worlds in gaming. however the open world content is seriously lacking, the ai of cops and civilians is horrible. npcs are lifeless they just stand there smoking or doing nothing. most of night city is just cosmetic you can't interact with it apart from a few shops and restaurants. if you only care about playing the main story and side quests you'll probably really like it, but if you were excited to explore night city freely this game will disappoint you. also the bugs and launch state on consoles are extremely bad, especially after all of the delays. people were expecting the delays to mean the game would come out finished and polished instead it got delayed so we could have a buggy experience and terrible optimization for console players."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-21,"too buggy and poorly optimized, but these can be fixed, gameplay and the storyline is solid. played it for around 55 hrs and still going strong. just keep updating and fixing the game, it is really promising."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-19,"the game is simply amazing. the obvious criticism is somewhat still present, but for the scope and scale of cyberpunk, these criticisms are far from accurate. i've picked it up, albeit with a bit of reluctance because of reviews and negative pr about the publisher. that's all  the game was made for pc and it shines on the platform. you'll need high end hardware to be sure, i'm running it on a funny equipped aw x17 r1, i911980hk, rtx3080 16gb, and 64gb of ram all 3 running intense overclock. that's said, my god the game is beautiful at psycho rtx settings. the game would of benefited from another year of closed door development, but the accomplishments of cdpr on this title should not be diminished. great game, pay full price. it's worth it. don't play on a console."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-19,"i have never played single player games when they are just released game. i wait 3 months for aa games and 6 months for aaa games like cyberpunk. i have waited 9 months for cyberpunk. i have started to play at 1.30v. now it's 1.31v. there are still little bugs, but it's ok. the atmosphere of game, story, music everything is cool. i really feel like i'm at 2077 while i'm playing. user interface is also very good. there are many things to do. if there many things to do normally it becomes so much complex. but this game achieved to keep many things simple."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-18,"i feel like this game is not bad at all. people really hate. right, the game is still full of glitches, and even some gamebreaking ones. but it's still a fun game. the guns in the game are very satisfying to use and i find them very interesting. if you play on a computer, the population, and the density of the traffic on night city will make the game feel very alive. the map is very immersive and big, which i adore. i talked about the glitches, but i would have to talk about it again. it could be funny, but it could be gamebreaking either. i think most people will agree about the fact that the melee combat wasn't very fun. the game was also way shorter than i initially thought it would be and the dialogues could be pretty unengaging at a times. the story isn't my cup of tea, that's for sure. but i can appreciate it. would i recommend the game? yes. does the game worth the money? not really. wait for a sale."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-16,"a great game, a lackluster rpg. this will be a spoilerfree review. what i could say about cyberpunk i could not fit in a 5000 character limit, so i won't even try to do it but i will express what i have on my mind after freshly beating it. cyberpunk is an atmospheric thriller. my system is older, and the game ran just well enough for me to enjoy it. it wasn't fantastic, and i would not say the game is optimized but i pushed through, but the visuals were great. the city does feel like one of the most detailed hand crafted maps in a video game i've ever played  however, while nothing feels samey, there is very little to actually do outside of missions. from my experience there are no casinos, actual restaurants, properties, minigames or more. this isn't the worst thing, but what little marketing i saw made me believe that would not be the case and there'd be more to do. the characters are enjoyable, and the felt unique enough. no characters felt like filler, or like they were too similar to another. voice acting in almost all instances were excellent. i do have a few complaints in regards to a few characters but they weren't awful. keanu's performance at the beginning was strange, and then soon after it got genuinely lifeless, however he does fix that not too long after that, it turned out much better than i thought. grimes' character was another glaring instance of strange emotionless voice acting, there are times where its done well, but a few lines threw me off. the rpg mechanics are fine, nothing incredible and certainly nothing unique but they served their purpose. gear was sparse and the stats i found on them were strange, you did have the option to buy them but it felt worthless to do so as i always seemed to find better pieces from killing enemies. i often looked very goofy and not exactly how i pictured myself but there are outifts to remedy that but i just couldn't find many. guns are fine, they're separated into categories that break down by type and they have unique perks like ricocheting and more. there is a degree of customization and upgrades with your guns but its not super complicated which is nice. some guns come with mod slots and attachment slots, i did not see both but i'd be surprised if they didn't exist, and all guns come with sight slots so you can get a sight that suits your preferences. the side missions i was told were not that compelling and often felt like fetch quests, however i did not feel like that at all, i think they really delved deeper into the characters we knew or introduced to new fascinating ones. the games story is strange, i have in my notes when i first started the exposition is compelling, then strange, clich but compelling prologue. i redacted the sections with spoilers, but after finishing i felt that best fits it. i'd say the story is strange not because it makes no sense, but the way its told at the start is very confusing, it does come to you pretty quick, in my notes there's a progression of me confused and eventually getting it, but its a quick process. the plot is well established but like many other games makes you feel like you have to rush and cannot do side content. i did end up doing side content, but i did not do a ton, but i finished several side story lines. what i once believed to be a clich or common cyberpunk trope ended up turning into something much more developed and much deeper and thoughts i had written in my notes are not what ended up coming to fruition. its not overly lengthy, and the beginning up until the end is very enjoyable. the endings are where things get different. my ending wasn't bad, but it left a lot of questions and things to be desired, however the other endings i watched and read offer far less closure. i understand why the game wants to be open ended with their endings but it does frustrate me to a degree. i will warn you now, as the game does, when you start your ending mission you cannot come back. no matter what ending you have, you are unable to return to the city to continue things afterward. this should not be taken as a spoiler, as it doesn't really indicate anything other than you need to save as you start your final mission. i do not expect to see any dlc or updates to remedy my questions, but it did not ruin my experience with the game, it just left me a bit annoyed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-16,"bugs aren't the main issue here it's the main storyline that falls short. i'm a huge fan of blade runner, and i can't deny the joy i feel when i'm driving around night city, taking on contract kills with my handgun or katana. these moments give me strong blade runner vibes and are a highlight of the game. but here's where the conflict arises  the game isn't sandbox enough to let you carve out your own story. many buildings in the city remain inaccessible, which i understand from a workload perspective, but it still feels like a facade. the main story, in my opinion, isn't great and feels quite tedious, falling short of the benchmark set by witcher 3. despite this, i've spent about 50 hours enjoying most of what the game offers. it's rare to find a game that can hold my attention for this long, but i can't shake the feeling that it could have been the best game of all time. however, almost a year after its release, the developers haven't fully delivered on their promises. whenever i think of cyberpunk 2077, i'm left with a sense of disappointment, a lingering aftertaste of what could have been, and a sense of betrayal by the marketing."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-04,"the game isn't 110, but isn't even close to good. it is 610 at best even once the bugs are polished in another year. i voted 010 because the average is biased garbage. 710 is what you would see at the low end of actually innovative game like botw. this game is at best a 56 out of 10. the features removed destroyed the game and the prevalence of 4 mission types repeated to make 120150 missions makes the game beyond trash and boring. it innovates in nothing and excels in also nothing. the police act worse than gta 3, no joke, they teleport in, even after patch. sure now, they teleport in further, but still, gta has cops that actually respond and show up, no cheating  like teleportation. they claimed it would innovate but the ceos remnoved all innovation in any feature. the game does a lot, but is beyond mediocre in all of it. it is as mediocre as any game can be, the story has amazing moments jackiejohnny, offset by a lot of garbage johnny as well... as well as the myth that choices of any kind in the game matter, it is a play our way game and all other choices, even the best ending are trash... the game promised a lot, and i think the premise that it never could have lived up to the hype is ignorance. all it had to do was be witcher in a cyberpunk world. instead they delivered cyberpunk, a world of xxx  stores at every corner, no cyberpunk museums, zoos, or anything else, just xxx sex shops everywhere and a bunch of stuff you cannot enter and a mediocre experience of removed features across the board. features like create you own weapons and armor work worse than any other game, let alone comparisons to witcher. if you created too many items it would corrupt your save game in the first month. with no fix ever, until it was patched. this is a bethesda level game breaking bug, but they are cd projekt red so... ignore reality and 1010 even though it innovates on nothing and is subpar compared to witcher 3."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-09-01,"most anticipated game of 2020 became the most hated one. console players may find it fair, due to terrible optimization, countless bugs, extremely low fps and overall graphics downgrade. pretty justified hatred indeed. but pc version came out in better and more polished shape so most of those notorious problems passed by me. main plot kept me glued to the screen throughout the entire campaign. game was filled throughandthrough with humor and irony, even though most of events in the story were quite tragical. cyberpunk aesthetics was original. there was no grim noir vibe inherent to the genre , nightcity was actually bright and sun shone constantly. but the main genre concept high tech  low life remained and was represented honorably. gameplay is... normal. neither bad nor superb. just another openworld first person action  la far cry but with rare rpg elements. map is immense and welldetailed so you will certainly spend couple tens of hours only exploring it. music, characters, dialogs  everything was made with soul. i can't agree with people  pc players particularly who give this game 010 and blame cd project in degradation solely because of several bugs and overall technical state. cyberpunk 2077 is a true nextgen experience if you play it on appropriate pc, and even if you don't have one an average computer can still run it on a typical consolegame level. despite all flaws cyberpunk can impress , just give it a chance. solid 810"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-28,"the new standard for overpromise and under deliver. cprd literally spend 3x as much marketing the game as they did for dev and it shows. despite being in development for years and years allegedly the majority of the game was just tossed together in like 3 years. either way no one really cares about how long it was in development or how much crunch the devs had to endure. we paid for a product and were ripped off. the same is very short if you only follow the core story. the story is bad. the same also has maybe 25 of the features advertised in the run up to launch and that's being generous. huge sections that were advertised as much as 23 months before release were cut. entire quest lines just end with no resolution or follow up. driving, a critical skill in the game, is literally the worst driving mechanism in the last 20 years of gaming. it's like each car as roller stakes. ai is basically non existent. cops spawn right next to you and just open fire. all civilians react the exact same way. cars far away are rendered as 2d animation and obviously disappear as you get close. about 13 of the perks in game don't actually work and another 13 are basically useless such as being stealthy underwater literally never used in gameplay and 100 completed game. there's endless things to complain about. this isn't even getting into the endless bugs, crashes, and graphical glitches. as of 1.3 it's not unusual at all to see cars vault off the street and into the stars, civilians all dressed the same, and destroyed cars zombie driving around with dead drivers. cdpr promised the stars and instead sold a 20 bargain bin title for 60."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-25,"it is difficult to compare to witcher 3, probably not even fair. that has so many established background and builds upon a common tale and story background that cyberpunk can not build upon. the whole setting is different, it is a very dark future utopia, with the litter everywhere and the missing animals. there are so many perks in the game that the same quest can be done with various ways. one play through can just exploit one of the many styles you could try. the shorter story resulted in lack of established bonds with the other characters, so i could not really care in a way as in the witcher. also the plethora of weapons result in that you do not bond with your weapon neither as in the next corner you will find one with 0.2 dmg higher stats and you dismantle the current one for ammo. the weapons have unique features but it is interesting that the sniper rifles has nearly the smallest damage while the revolvers have the highest. driving the car felt difficult and i always hit somebody that resulted in cops so i switched to motorcycle instead soon. though it was buggy as hell and always teleported under cars, you could go into a car with it, so that part is very unpolished. the side quests had also lot of bugs, so instead of stucking at a wrong point i missed most of them. the melee weapons are difficult to use in close combat as some enemies are superfast and you just hit the air with them. it was absolutely worth to play with it. and the good news is that the engine is ready, now it only needs to be exploited and fill in with various contents from now on."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-17,glad to see a lot of patches and fixes for improvement. i've been playing for 100 hours now and i still have a lot to go through as an interesting and exciting gameplay game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-17,"i expected that this game will be a revolution, but in the end we got a game full of bugs and stupid ai. graphics and storyline are good, but gameplay needs some work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-17,"broken game since launch. overhyped, missing features, open city with with cookie cutter missions, soulless game, broken game mechanics, buggy missions,  ai  etc. the lists just goes on and on. do yourself a favor, use your money on other more worthwhile games."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-16,"it's bad. really, really bad. i preordered the game in anticipation for what turned out to be the biggest letdown in video game history. even watchdogs was better. the game is and was unfinished, the story is boring and the choices don't matter as much as the trailer would make you believe. if i could, i'd want my money back  but some mistakes can't be reverted."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-16,"this game was a miss for me,i expected so much more from the game,but its playable and you will enjoy it if you didn't overhyped the  mechanics are good,but yet kinda outdated,it looks like you are playing game from 2015."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-16,"in my opinion, this is one of the best games ever. i just finished it. it was 50 hours of great fun. the main story is really nice, but to feel it better, you can't just go through it. you have to check the side quest and feel the city. based on the comments, i am really surprised by the optimization of this game. i have around 3040 fps which sometimes went down to  20 when fighting multiple enemies. i was playing on a pc on ryzen 2400g, so i don't have a powerful computer and yet it was nice to play on minimal hd. the game still looks good on these settings"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-15,"if it weren't for the glitches this game might be mediocre. even without the endless amount of glitches the game is repetitive while the diologue seems like it never ends and the game play is quite limited. driving could be slightly improved, the game as a whole could be majorly improved."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-09,one of the best story telling games of all time despite some bugs and glitches. never before have i felt such emotions in a game as i did during the credits. an absolute masterpiece of story telling. really really love this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-08-08,"this game doesn't deserve the hate bandwagon. it's great open world game with very unique different missions. sure there are some glitchy mechanics and they'll be adding polish to make sure those happen less over time but the core experience is there for everyone to enjoy. if you rate this game anywhere below 7, all your opinions should be disqualified forever. i've seen accounts with 0 reviews paid accounts working for competition? downvoting this game with 010 reviews. everyone already knows the game is buggy. but you know what? so is red dead redemption 2, so is gta 5, so is every single open world game out there, witcher 3 included. the level of anger the gaming community shows to the one of the most charitable company is simply just stunning. shows exactly the level of group think, mob mentality and ability to be persuaded to believe anything. in couple of years everyone will be asking themselves why was i hating this game so much after watching the actual gameplay footage of the game, rather than these very nitpicky glitch compilations. newsflash glitch compilations are not representative of what the game actually is 99.9 of the time. sure i get some stupid bugs maybe once a day, my car flips or a character starts walking after being incapacitated, yeah it's annoying, but it happens so rarely and i've been playing the game since launch i just don't get what the point of all the hate is. you guys ever played skyrim? the game is notorious for it's buggyness, and yet everyone was rating that game 1010 experience, must play. why can't there be option to actually remove accounts with only one 0 star review from the scoring system? i did some math and it would actually boost the average user score above 8."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-07-14,"cyberpunk is by no means a bad game ,the game had its few great moments but its clear as crystal that the game is simply an unfinished mess and im completely ignoring the buggs here ,cyberpunk tries to be many things but fails at pretty much all of them ,the world is stunningly beautiful but at the same time its lifeless that its even haunting ,gangs ,ncpd and trauma team add nothing to the game ,some of the character related side quests are goat tier but most of it are some ubisoft tier fetch and kill quests that are no where near as good as the contracts from the witcher 3 ,npcs and police system are not just bad they are completely broken even after the patches ,the story had its great moments and the characters were phenomenal but the pacing is extremely fast it feels like its summarizing a story rather than experiencing and entire story ,it takes only 1820 hours to beat it which is a far cry compared to the witcher 3 which had 50 hour main quest ,the gameplay is kinda meh ,its not bad but its not great and the rpg mechanics and choices are basically none existent and are just there ,its also quite jarring how much potential content is there but you cant interact with ,not even a single mini game. the problem with cyberpunk is that it tries to be many things but fails at pretty much all of them. you want an open world with deep rpg mechanics where your choices mean something? play fallout nv you want to play an open world game with an amazing story and a lively open world? play rdr 2 you want to play a cyberpunk game? play the deus ex series you want a great open world game with amazing side quests? play the witcher 3 you want to play a smaller open world game that is filled with amazing mini games? play yakuza 0 you want to play an open world game with a much better police system? play gta you want to play an open world rpg with meaningful choices ,character customization freedom that rewards you for it and a great faction system? play fallout new vegas again im not saying cyberpunk is bad its just that there are much better games out there."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-07-06,"false advertising, 90 of advertised features are either missing or wildly overexaggerated. hacking and stealth is a massive waste of time. skill tree is a cluttered mess with most improvements giving just a number increase here or there. crafting is yet another cluttered mess. driving feels bad and npc ai is jarring. enemy ai is just as bad. wanted system is a joke. scammers!!!!!!!!!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-07-05,unplayable . even after the patches the game still suffers from extremely noticeable glitches and bugs . this game is robbery . it was a very different game from what it was hyped up to be . not a single dime should be given . the story is interesting but the game still suffers from the hype it built . millions of dollars and a bigger team of game devs and more time to develop than witcher 3...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-07-05,"i'm changing my original review. i had given this game an 8 based on my initial impression, but after playing this game for over 80 hours and nearly completing all quests, i think this game is a 610 at best. what a beautiful disaster. there are so many instances where it seems like the devs had a good and interesting idea that just never got fully implemented or scrapped altogether. i had even waited 7 months v1.23, but there are still lots of immersionbreaking bugs like floating cars, semi broken side quests. in one instance a door panel just said dynamic text after entering the code because they forgot to change the text. i also didn't find the end to the main quest to be very satisfying, but not the worst. i'm hoping there will be some dlc or something, night city hashad so much potential if every detail had been fully fleshed out. anyway, i've found cyberpunk 2077 to be very hollow, compared to witcher 3, after my first play through."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-07-03,i'm confused why people say it's bad. i'm about 15 hours in on xbox series x and it's absolutely stunning! the world is huge and varied and beautiful with insane details and characters. the music and atmosphere are top notch and feel badass. it's also very challenging and has a lot of skills and mechanics to learn. i absolutely love this game. if you're a sophisticated gamer who likes electronica and industrial themes and such you will really really dig this game.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-28,"coming into the game pretty late here. we all know what went on with this game and their is no reason to beat a dead horse. overhyped and completely unfinished upon release. however, i personally just picked this up on a sale at gog and have been having a pretty good time with the game on the pc. i'm gonna say thing, if you don't have at least a basic rtx card or radeon equivalent, don't bother. the game looks terrible without ray tracing. i turned it off to up my fps and just couldn't take it. my eyes were not taking it well at all. i ended up turning ray tracing on and put a bunch of other settings to medium and low to get into the 60 fps range on my gaming laptop, 2070 rtx maxq with 32 gb ram. this game is a hoss now, so i can only imagine how it was launch, lol. that aside, this game does some things extremely well. great immersion factor and the environments are constructed with an immense attention to detail. there is plenty to do, from the lowliest side missions that pop up randomly to the full blown main missions and main side missions. the map is littered with icons ala ubisoft games. it's both a blessing and a curse but is typical of open world games. anyway, the games systems are a bit convoluted and it honestly you can just upgrade your melee fighting skills and annahilate any group of foes with a katana, but it's fun to play around with other methods. if someone asked me to describe this game in one sentence i would just say it's deus ex mankind divided but on a much bigger scale. if you liked that game, you should pick up cyberpunk. not perfect, but finally playable and worth a look. you can tell that the actual developers and not the corpo heads in charge of cdpr cared a lot for this project. there is a lot to love here, but ultimately does not reach the ridiculous mountain of hype this game got. i'm having fun playing it though and i'm about half way through the main story. thumbs up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-28,"playing on pc. there are technical issues, but nothing that has spoiled my enjoyment of the engaging story and characters. the world of night city is breathtaking to look at and feels alive as my v walks the streets and takes in the sights and sounds around them. i have no doubt that i will be replaying this game many times to see the results of taking the different options and life paths. however, the npcs don't appear to be living their own lives, many looking like they are walking around aimlessly, the cars stopping in the middle of the street and causing the traffic to just halt. the ai needs some work. it's not the game i was expecting, but i enjoyed the first playthrough, and i am now on my second."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-23,"i played the v1.2 on rtx3060. having seen many negative reviews, i played with a negative bias, but as the time goes on, i like the game more and more. to be honest, i enjoyed this game a lot. i spent 52 hours to finish playing it within 10 days. let me address the cons. the game still has minor bugs during the missions, where sometimes the enemies are dumb, but they don't break the game. the pedestrians, cars and police are dumb, but i don't really care too much about that since i don't spend a lot of time doing what i would do in gta 5. what make this game ticks are 1. the gameplay. on some scenes i feel like a badass 2. the characters. i feel like i have developed a good connection with all the major side characters. there are moments of 'wow'. 3. the graphics. there are also many moments where i look at a particular scene and went 'wow'. 4. the music. i really enjoy the selection of music, they blend in very well with the game. i would say that cyberpunk passes the threshold as a good game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-17,unfinished mess   50 of the features that are promised in each trailer are not included or not working properly. half of all item systems and stats not working. shallow missions  decisions almost do not matter  bad ui  it's like an overhyped and overlong movie with nothing in it that you haven't seen before. except that i paid 60 for it on release instead of 10 for a forgettable flick. i feel badly scammed!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-17,"the game is littered with more bugs than a bethesda game, and is missing more promised features than the original watch dogs, ultimately leaving the game with gameplay that is below average even if you are somehow able to ignore the bugs. even more than half a year after it's initial release. the gameplay is stale and uninteresting as it brings nothing new to the table, the game has a lot of different gameplay styles to offer but its average at best in all categories, think of driving, shooting, melee, hacking and to be honest we can't really speak of any opportunities for stealth in this game due to the lacking ai. the story, worldbuilding, and lore of the game is however very good, which is no surprise due to the large amount of source material available to cdpr. its really easy to get completely immersed in the world of the game. however where they lacked was in the differences between the starting points of the game, cdpr gave us a choice between 3 startingpoints of the game nomad, streetkid  corpo. these were supposed to have great impact on our story, unfortunately the only change it offered was the very beginning of the game and later on a few dialog options which ultimately don't do much. the game is just in an unfinished state right now. as stated earlier there are a bunch of promised features just straight up missing from the game. but you can see in the game however that they were planning to implement them, there are plenty of areas where you can see in the level design that certain features were supposed to be used, like using gorilla arms to break open doors, or mantis blades to run on walls. these details in level design remain even though the features themselves got scrapped probably due to insufficient time for development. it goes much further than just those however, players have already found completely decorated interiors in otherwise inaccessible buildings like clothing stores and barber shops, showing that at one point during development they were planning on implementing these into the game. overall this makes the game just not what people suspected it to be nor what cdpr had promised to deliver. even more than half a year after it's initial release and cdpr promising to keep improving the game after release. the best they have been able to do is make small changes to how the police spawn around the player, some animation changes and a bunch of bugfixes which the player barely notices in the ocean of bugs that still remain. although i appreciate the initiative to fix those bugs, there has not been an attempt to improve the actual gameplay itself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-17,"its not a masterpiece and there are lots of impurities cause of the early release. but it is one of the best games of the last 5 years. it isnt an rpg really, but its a far better gtav with nice story and grand immersion. if you didnt hop on the hypetrain beforehand your in for a great game. looking forward to some dlc's though."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-14,"updated close to the end, i've noticed the quirks and the general emptiness of the game. i never had a crash though and i liked the story. it's just it doesn't look so good once you scratch the varnish. i've adjusted the score accordingly. original cyberpunk 2077 is a dark, sometimes depressing, dystopian, resolutely adultonly game with an accurate take on the cyberpunk genre. gamer discretion is advised  there is violence, gore even, and it doesn't shy from sexual references. the rendering is beautiful and the music fits well with the atmosphere. the raytracing clearly adds the the realism. i've found the story very enjoyable. the characters i've encountered are well fleshed out. i love interacting with them, it's fantastic. it has been a long time since i felt an emotional response to a video game character. the world feels alive, even if it's for a short time given that violence is never far. during some transitions, i feel like in a good movie. sometimes a depressing scene reminds me of the original blade runner. if i wanted to be nitpicking, ... one thing that could be improved as far as i'm concerned is the key customization. i've been able to reconfigure what i needed but i would like to be able to reconfigure everything. also, i've encountered once an issue consistent in one pedestrian disappearing midwalk. i've heard some people had performance issue, my machine isn't exactly weak though, and the game is installed on an highspeed nvme. this is the best game i've played in a long time, by far  i'm not easily pleased. if you are an adult attracted by good stories, dystopian worlds, roleplay in general and you own a relatively powerful computer, preferably with an rtx card, you have to try this one."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-12,"bajo mi experiencia, la cantidad de bugs no fue tan abundante en mi primera partida, habiendo jugado en las versiones 1.20, 1.21 y 1.22. tiene una historia bastante interesante, con un ritmo que se mantiene constante, con muy buenos personajes y una ambientacin muy bien llevada. el apartado grfico es sobresaliente, la jugabilidad es divertida y algo adictiva. sin embargo, hay que recalcar tambin que comete errores algo graves, como es su mundo abierto, ya que este carece de vida o no tiene un impacto real. incluyendo adems la falta de cosas que se prometieron en los trileres. lo recomendara comprar cuando llegu alguna oferta o su precio sea algo accesible. con una rtx 2060 y i7 de sptima generacin corre muy bien a 60fps con todo en ultra y dlss activado."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-07,"note i have refunded this graphics demo after playing for a almost two hours thanks to steam's refund policies after noticing several issues with this game not the bugs, but game mechanics that are either broken, poorly implemented or simply omitted. several videos and reads confirmed what i feared the overhyped cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 in an unfinished state and garnered outstanding reviews by paid off critics world wide, who didn't play it  there is no way that they could have given it all the 10s out of 10s if they had. more and more came out about the state of this game by cdpr insiders who were shocked that this game was pushed out for release, stating that it wasn't finished and would need at least one more year. this unfinished state was clearly visible through and through take the wanted system which said employees have stated was not integrated in the game and had to be thrown together to rush it out the door, the result is a system in which cops spawn into the world behind you and shoot instantly. they are incapable of following the player in vehicles ai in this game is abysmal. the game is full of features that feel like they were programed 5 minutes before it was rushed out the door, several features that were promised are missing or included in a very basic way. now, i heard that some patches fix some issues, but i have no desire to returning to this pile of dog p00p. the state in which it was released is an audacity and cdpr lied about it, which makes it even worse. i also had the feeling the devs ditched the original storyline when keanu reeves came on board. some characters feel like they had a longer storyline originally but got cut down to a sideshow to make room for the main attraction. i like keanu reeves, but i really think this game would have been better with the original story. all in all, even the aspects cyberpuke 2077 gets right are not as astounding as critics say either graphics are good but not mindblowing even with maxed out raytracing. character models range from ok main characters to outright ugly pedestrians, the open world is sterile and lifeless with npc ai being braindead as if they were in a zombie game. compare the graphics you get in the retail version with the 2018 preview you clearly see that cdpr have downgraded their graphics again. it looks nowhere near as good. then driving is just terrible as well. there is zero traction, cars feel like they are made out of paper. it's ridiculous! and when you turn corners it doesn't feel like a car on wheels turning but rather like a tank. well, is it at least immersive? hell no! the world is sterile with pedestrians spawning in up the street and fading out down the street  sometimes even as soon as they leave your view. i saw a car wanted to highjack and i lost it for a split second and there was no tracking it down since it faded out! npcs don't really live either, they are glued to a specific spot  day and night. there is zero life in this game, zero. compare cyberpunk 2077 to gta v red dead redemption 2 and you will see big differences in the game world, the latter being literally alive. do not buy cyberpuke 2077 and buy necromunda hired gun instead if you want cyberpunk done right."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-06-06,"time to update my rating after 6 months since the ''promises'' that cdpr said that they would deliver. no major fixes or improvements, game still feels sluggish, and really nothing to do in this game after completing it and seeing all the boring endings accept of the panam ending which is the best one imo. overall im keeping my old review below the update but honestly dont bother with this game anymore. after going ahead and completing the game and waiting for more patches to come out i promised myself i will delete my old review and edit the review and truly describe how much of the hype was real about cyberpunk 2077. im gonna start by saying that the people comparing the game to gta or any rockstar titles, just note that rockstar has more than half of cdpr's staff and have a bigger budget as well as investors and backers and have much more experience in open world games. so if youre trying to trash other open world games that are not made by rockstar then your comparison is awful! and you probably didnt play any bethesda or ubisoft which is the worst of the bunch games at all! and you should appreciate was cdpr delivers in this game and you will see that they truly make games with a ton of heart and soul. after i got that out of the way here is my review i want to say that cyberpunk 2077 is such a beautiful game in all its aspects, with so much attention to detail in dialogues with npc's and the open world and especially the amazing night city. especially when playing on a high end pc youre going to experience rtx like ever before and i dint think visually there is no game thats matching cyberpunk! the game is so freaking beautiful and so realistic and alive. but one thing is for sure its missing a ton of physics to be implemented into the engine. other than that, the gameplay is very very fun but at times it can be meh like and not realistic or fun at all. when you start guns blazing everywhere its not fun at all like in cod but feels more like far cry, heck even the npc's during combat act like the ridiculous npc's like in far cry so you wont find anything interesting when you get noticed, rather i found stealth to be much more fun in the game and far more interesting with loads of different approaches and especially fun once you upgrade your cyberweare and skills. the melee combat is also meh and not as impactful or interesting unless you use the mantis blades, all the fist fights and sword fights are not as fun or impactful. driving in the game is dull and faster cars feel so bubbly like where the just fly all over when you get to a certain speed, and the mini map while driving really needs an improvement!!! i believe they shouldve just taken driving influence from nfs games where its exactly in between realistic and arcadey. story wise, omg the story is unbelievable! its so beautiful and well crafted and so many options and paths to choose and overall i dont want to spoil anything, but wow! i have also never felt so connected to video game characters like this since the mass effect trilogy! tho it is missing a ton of content and scenes and you can feel the cut out content to try and rush the game but i felt like it really needed more, and i dont know who complained about how the witcher 3 was long but thats probably cdpr not showing self blame that they tried to rush this project as much as possible in the best way possible. i really wanted more acts or a opening missions and something longer that wouldnt make me feel so empty after i finished the game. i dont want to talk about much of the story to not spoil but i wish the game was longer because it needed that extra 1020 more hours of story telling. hopefully dlc's will make up for that. soundtrack is phenomenal! nothing to add much because its a 10! so overall to not make this review entirely long im going to say that i am 100 absolutely loving the game! it does live up to the hype and im so in love with cyberpunk! tho there is missing features and cut out content that really disappointed me in a way but non the less its a well crafted game that is a must buy on pc! and i cannot wait to see what cdpr continues to bring in the future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-31,"playing this on the pc with a high spec machine is a dream. its something similar to outer worlds i would say, more than it is similar to witcher or fallout. overall a great experience. the gameplay is fun and fluid, albeit not groundbreaking. the setting, story, and voice acting however wow. superb. length perfect. i do not want another game like the witcher 3 with 200 hours of gameplay. im an adult and have no time for that. i want a game i can enjoy, beat, and move on. and there is certainly a lot of replay value for those wanting a longer experience overall it is a great experience. avoid the haters review bombing. and the pc version doesnt have bugs like consoles. its a great game worthy of your time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-30,"despite all the other people having lots of issues with this title i was lucky and had none of them. i was able to enjoy the game in all its glory without any major bugs or gamebreaking issues. so i had one hell of a ride! a masterpiece! really a shame that it didnt work for so many people and obviously miss management and cheating on old console customers expectations thru fake promises and presentations. only bugs i encounterd where fast running on sidewalkstreet and police spawning just a few feet away from yourself. so nothing crazy at all. the worldbuilding, the details of it where just incredible, lived up completly to my expectations. the storytelling was a bit obviously and easy to predict, so not many woah im suprised moments, but overall still very well done. the whole 100h playthru for me felt like binge watching your favourite series. voice actors did amazing jobs and i had fun to explore every corner of the world. really a shame that it will never be goty due to all the bad reputation it has due to missmanagement."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-29,cyberpunk is so immersive and the story and characters are great. there are a few bugs but they don't ruin the game experience in pc.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-29,it's excellent. the bad reviews were from people who expected a video game with quantum artificial intelligence. the cd pr had never promised that
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-27,"awesome, immersive open world with one of the most breathtaking depictions of a futuristic dystopian city that i've ever seen. has some bugs but go in on a high end pc and you will be relatively fine. also, this is not gta, so don't go in expecting to engage in a chaotic crime spree. i had a great time in the game with my only gripe being the ai. play it for what it is and not what the hype train wanted it to be!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-27,"60100 i enjoyed this game. its not exactly what i was hoping but i still did like it. now i played this on pc where it was at least stable most of the time but i still had plenty of frame drops and some textures not working or loading wrong. as an rpg its not very good most dialogue choices are just for show and usually there's only one or two choices that move the story. crafting's basically non existent and the amount of components you get for breaking down weapons is so low its not a really viable strategy because the cost of upgrading is so high. you can't buy weapons becuse the cost is also to high, the amount of money you make from missions is so low and that most things you'd want to buy is just to expensive."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-27,i love you cyber punk 2077 . best characters i've ever seen. thank you cd project red.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-25,"a good story driven adventure, not really a good rpg and very very few real choise. wonderfull map and a really good graphic, i did not find particular bugs but i've a great pc setup. it's not the game they promised but it's a good game if you play it on a real good pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-25,"the best game ever! even better than minecraft. graphics are beautiful, optimisation is good i downloaded optimisation mod story is a masterpiece. just whole game is masterpiece"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-24,"el juego es increible, es inmenso, el mapeado puede parecer no tan grande, pero la realidad es que la mayoria de edificios en el juego esta modelado con sus pisos y su gente en el interior, ascensores, televisores, radios, luces, gente, el juego esta lleno de cosas y detalles. ahora la parte mala, los bugs xd tiene muchos, nada que te impida terminar el juego, mas que nada cosas visuales y los tiempos de carga de texturas, si demora algunos segundos dependiendo de cuantas texturas deba cargar, cuando est pulido merecer mas de un 10. la historia es muy interesante, una ciudad de mier... y una critica a todos los grupos de poder en el mundo, incluido la comida de plastico xd. inclusion no forzadas, raro ver una mujer con pene, pero es opcional xd, mi primera partida hasta pasarlo fueron 85 horas. recomendado"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-24,"un juego muy esperado, decepciono al principio y continua. narrativa mente es fantstico y todos sus personajes tienen carisma. las actividades secundarias tienen un impacto significativo en la historia el trabajo de cdpr por repararlo no lo vi en ninguna compaa mas. en el apartado grafico no se puede decir mas que es una pasada de ciudad carteles luminosos etc, con rt sera una pasada. testeado con una 1080ti y una 980ti gold asus y una rx5700xt. este anlisis es con la version 1.22. mejorara mucho seguramente"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-24,best game graphic and story and gameplay also rpg element bet the game has some glitches
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-24,"story and sidestory are in some cases top notch. gameplay is mediocre. bugs are still there, a ton of them 1.22. luckily there is nexusmods for pc users. night city sadly feels a little empty and there is so so much unused potential. will edit my rating when there's been further patches and dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-24,"most disappointing release of all time. the game is not unplayable, but it is so broken it's certainly not enjoyable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-23,"yes, the programmers have messed up a bit. but the artists have done an outstanding job. the scale of the game world and the attention to detail just blow my mind. this game is purely a masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-23,total dissapointment even if the game not buggy mess with it current gameplaystory it at most 5 if it got a great non buggy launch it just generic action adventure game the world feel really empty and there like only 2 prostitute and with how sexualize this game it reasonable to expected an erotic adventure. it almost like the game is half done then some a55hole just ask to redo the game from a scracth it the vibe that i get
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-23,i love the cyberpunk environment. the poles made a great shooter with no experience in this. the only downside of the game is a bad open world
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-22,"scorebased review after 80 hours  gameplay 1010 story 1010 graphics 1010 soundtrack 910 immersion 1010 ai 710  overall one of the best games i've ever played. there are bugs but it is natural for a game this massive. my own beliefs i believe the team has been working so hard since 2013 to make it perfect. if someone wants such perfection, perhaps we might never get to play it. i believe that the improvements of the game will be synchronised in realtime with how the world develops. as new technology becomes more accessible, the graphics will be patched to match the original design. also, i believe that they are improving the ai. in the future, it will feel so real you can't even distinguish from the real world! ps if you quit because of some minor bugs, then you miss out something great here."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-22,"an excellent game with a decent deep storyline. as much as possible makes you immerse yourself in the history of each quest and empathize. in this game, the main problems are all the same in the technical part. the graphics engine was not assembled successfully, and the game has problems with the physics of everything. but all these problems pale in comparison with what awaits the player in the process of passing all the side and story quests, in which it is not known where the story may turn. sound and music are clearly integrated into the narrative, and the immersive experience becomes more natural. this my new game of the decade is unambiguous."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-22,"not what we were promised, however i had a blast playing this game nonetheless. although i have experience numerous issues and bugs i have still enjoyed my time with cyberpunk. i particularly liked learning more about the characters which i think are well written and compelling. the nightcity looks phenomenal when playing on higherend machines. the story is pretty great and the gameplay is serviceable especially when compared to other openworld games. when i finished the game, i felt kind of empty as i wanted the story to carry on so i can keep playing. one of my biggest issues with the game apart of the obvious bugs and glitches were the openworld activities like ncpd jobs and the gigs. most of them felt rushed and uninspiring at sometimes down right boring. overall, its the best unfinished game out there so lets hope they fix it for the nextgen release and provide us with free dlc and expansions. thanks for the game cdpr but i will never forget the lies and misleading marketing campaign."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-21,"i've just finished the game. i spent 102 hours with one ending. 2 hoursending, if you want to see all the endings. i did every sidequests, and collected every car. i think the main story is very interesting and esily to attract attention. some side quests are boring, but some are very funny and imaginative. the rpg and gunplay parts are good, nothing special. i play on normal graphics and qhd, and it was good to me, but the game in low graphics is very ugly. i played after some huge patch pack, so i didnt experience bugs, only a few, but thoose are rather amusing than irritating. i didnt disappoint. it worth the full price. it is an excellent game. i dont understand the mass hysteria arund the game. i recommend the game for everyone, who likes the rpgscifi."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-20,"cd project red really hyped up this game and although the witcher 3 wasn't perfect, the game was so damn amazing in several aspects so the expectations were so high but cyberpunk 2077 became a buggy and flawed video game in its gameplay and presentation. even after several patches some core gameplay problems are still there. cd project red could have easily blew up the world with this game but by rushing it they ruined everything about cyberpunk. cyberpunk's disastrous launch will be remembered as one of the worst moments in gaming history. the pc version is definitely way better than the console versions and can be a good way to experience the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-20,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-19,"the most ambitious game i've ever seen. those who gives it a bad reviews just cannot understand, how hard to make such a game. witcher 3 had few mechanics and animations of geralt and his enemies. cyberpunk has way, way more of everything  graphics is stunning, and optimisation is pretty good my rtx 2080 ti allows me to play at 60 fps in 4k, with dlss set to performance  shooting feels very good  there is actually physics  something that rarely exists in rpg  quests are made with love, this is not ubisoftlike game with tons of quests, each one of which is the same  night city is unbeliavable beautiful and big  there are tons of content cons  story will not make you cry, like witcher 3 did, but i don't know if that level of hearttouching story is possible in cyberpunk setting. i think we all should support cd projekt in order to have their great games in a future. yeah, this release was admittedly clunky, but how many compamies do you know, who make games like this?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-19,"i'm don't usuelly writes reviews but i really felt the need to write one for this game. it's unfinished, it really is. the current state of the game is absolutely simply sad. this game has a long way to go before it could ever be considered finished"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-19,very good story
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,"this game a is great! story and visuals are fantastic. i had launch issues, but im rating this as the game it is now after patch versus the people who are raging and wont give it a second chance."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,"to me the bugs were only a minor hindrance to the game even if i lost a couple of hours of progress, what bothered me far more is the lack of replayability, rewarding freeroam, polished mechanics and limited story options, the game is still good but it just lacks the amount of gameplay it should have, at its price tag and as the aaa game it pretends to be. many systems perform only mediocrely, the inventory system seems a blatant copy from deus ex but far worse, the items are just generally uninteresting, there are many weapon copies and the inventory is far too large, another example there are 2 medical items, one heals instantly and the other over time, but there is no reason not to use the noninstant one at all as it isn't really rarer or more expensive making it feel like a low effort copy to create the illusion of options. then there is the vehicles, i just didn't buy any because the game isn't enjoyable for long enough to bother getting a vechicle. stealth is also an example of the unpolished mechanics, just like the deus ex games you have an energy currency for powerful attacks and hacks, but they are quite overpowered and poorly balanced, sometimes takedowns are even disabled in missions because they couldnt balance them and no wonder, you can blind enemies with the attack points you get, which basically means you can take down any isolated enemy but doing so requires you to wait a minute before each attack to regain your attack points, trying to hide how broken the hacks are by forcing you to wait between attacks."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,"um dos piores games que j joguei, extremamente bugado, mal otimizado, no vale mais que 30 reais, embora seja um game feito pra quem tem um pc da nasa."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,"this games first steps were like tossing a toddler into the deep end, however this games gotten better, i surprisingly enjoy it even if it has flaws big enough it can make a giant hole in the experience, but its not out of the pond yet, they have to work hard and keep making it better, they cant afford to pull a bethesda at this moment"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,"loved this absolutely gorgeous game! i play openworld rpgs a lot and this one will remain as one of those seminal gaming moments for me. i admit i am lucky i have a decent pc rig so my review will be based on that. i have completed the game, as in, i got to the end of the current storyline but i did not do everything. gameplay is fantastic. controls are great. gunplay is awesome. the storyline is living and dense so dense, in fact, i forgot who was who at times which was a bit of a problem. the world you inhabit is the most gorgeous and engaging world i have ever played in a game. the artistry is superlative. you can fast travel but i stopped doing that as i just like travelling around the world. every gaming session i would stop to look at something, whether a grand scene or small detail. hats off to cd projekt red for this one. if you enjoy openworld rpgs you need to get this in your life. bugs, a few minor ones that did not detract and they went away with successive patches. driving was odd but i realised that this is not gta that sort of driving experience would not be suitable and they released a driving patch which did help a lot. i enjoyed travelling by vehicle. one minor thing that was annoying was the way you can see car lights in the distance. ok for city scenes but in the desert it looks really weird and jarring. stealth i did not really use although i would have liked to use it more but it didn't feel necessary. typically, a bit of stealth then using hacks and shooting everyone did the trick hacks are a lot of fun. summary, enjoyed this game immensely and will be going back when they release dlc for it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-17,"cyberpunk was a wasted opportunity, the first 56 hours of this game are really good but after that the game loses everything that was promised to be. the witcher iii wasn't perfect but cd project red could have easily built upon that game to deliver a way more balanced and variable openworld experience, but cyberpunk 2077 is none of those things."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-16,"en su estado actual el gameplay es muy disfrutable, si tienes pc para jugarlo. yo tengo 16gb de ram, un i7 8700k, y una 2070 no super. puedo ejecutarlo con todo en ultra, sin raytracing, y con dlc puesto en modo calidad, a 60fps constantes y a 1080p de resolucin. no cabe duda de que a cyberpunk le queda bastante trabajo. est plagado de bugs tontos, y tiene un puado de bugs molestos. algunos de los que encontr, son por ejemplo objetos que no se pueden recoger porque se bugea su interaccin. cuando cometes un crimen la polica hace pop y aparece de la nada. npcs bugeandose bajo el suelo incluso autos, los mencionados anteriormente pero atravesando estructuras. conversaciones que se cortan de la nada y toca cargar partida para saber de que trataba. muy rara vez me ha pasado que al llamar a un npc por telfono, este se teletransporta a mi lado y queda flotando en el aire wtf con esto. al recargar el arma no se reproduce la animacin de recarga, pero el arma recarga. aveces cuando me bajo de un auto, este desaparece. cuando cargo la partida y habia npcs o autos cerca, aveces desaparecen. cuando estaba cerca de enemigos y guard la partida, al cargarla y atacar a los enemigos, estos quedan en modo tontos por varios segundos y no se mueven, es como que se les laguea la ia. en fin, cyberpunk 2077 es un juego con muchsimos detalles, pero el cual cd projeckt red lanz demasiado pronto y sobre el cual minti en muchas cosas  dijo que iba a tener una branching story, y no la tiene.  el juego tiene 1 solo final, solo distintas formas de llegar a dicho final.  las elecciones que hagas realmente no importan, porque la conclusin de cada solo afecta a corto plazo, y no a alguna otra cosa importante.  la historia es demsiado corta, y esto causa que a pesar de dar mucha importancia a los distintos grupos de enemigos durante las presentaciones, no tengamos prcticamente nada de info, lore, o construccin sobre ellos.  todo lo que nombr arriba demuestra que el juego est rusheado. tendran que haberlo seguido haciendo mnimo hasta 2022, y quiz tambin hasta 2023. en su estado actual dudo muchsimo que cd projeckt meta las missing features en l."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-16,"this is a rubbish game. like from 2015 or earlier. trying to chear gta v. no comparison to gta v. horrible. no climate, no mechanic, no nothing. witcher was the game. no cyberpunk 2077. i regret spending money on it. horrible. such a game was not supposed to be released in 2021. don't spend money on it. you will waste it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-16,"honestly, one of the only recent games which really made me feel immersed into the story and connect with the characters. excellent gunplay, mechanics, voice acting and character writing. one point down for technical difficulties and some areas of weakness, most notably the ai of npcs outside of quests. game of the year, too bad it came under pressure from both players and investors to release before the developers thought it was ready. at the end of the day, could it have been better? yes did it meet all that it promised ahead of release? certainly not, but i can't deny it's still one of the best games out there which you can currently pick up. go ahead and play it yourself, you won't regret it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-15,"stupid game. buggy mess. what a disappointment for a game in development for more than 8 years, and it is really laggy and slow. i cant see why this stupid game kills many graphics cards."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-15,one of the best games i ever played. night city  best city i ever seen in games.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-15,"in my opinion cyberpunk is incredibly good. its is probably the best game i ever played, very good story about real problems in the future, incredibly graphics and very nice open world. the only downsides are many bugs and sometimes awful driving and shooting mechanics!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-14,"this game is great! great story, good gameplay and good shooting. but there are a lot of bugs and poor optimization."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-12,"pros the story and characters are amazing with spectacular visuals and some very amazing side quests also the gunplay is very good in my opinion also some good netrunning mechanics and some pretty good stealth. cons the ai is very bad, the gigs  with almost no variety at all, there is wayyyy too much bugs even on the pcconsole, the driving , you can't do anything with any of the npc's, the physics are so bad to the point that san andreas a game that was made in 2002 has better physics than this, most of the content in the open world ncpd shootouts are boring as hell, this game is not an rpg like it was marketed to be like, most of the time when you run over a person they will fall over like a ragdoll with no bones, there is only one useful cyberware the other ones are practically useless, the fighting is very very very bad, don't bother to spend your skill points on intelligence because you will never use hacking, sometimes when you are in a fire fight between enemies they will look like ps1 characters, most of your actions don't have consequences, and also your life paths are useless verdict this game is very unfinished in its state right now and has many problems even without the glitches and bugs . i hope this game becomes like no man's sky and it improves after dlc's but for now i do not recommend this game to anyone. 610"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-12,"cyberpunk 2077 patch 1.22 life is full of drama, and so is the whole story around and in cyberpunk 2077. the game is so special, somehow everything fits together. i played the game for 97 hours. completed all the missions and still don't want to leave night city. cd projekt red have created something unique. it's something that not everyone likes, but... i don't know. the game world is the embodiment of fear and longing from days gone by. i don't want to convert anyone back for the game here, but  you're missing out. i wish i could forget everything again and start over."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-10,"i have liked the game so far, when i bought the game i thought that it was gonna be as bad as lunch but it got better and now i love the game and the story its fantastic. to those who are planning to buy the game but are not so sure i would say go for it. now to say there are some few bugs but its not that bad i actually just laugh at it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-10,"ok it's full of bugs even after two massive patches, ok you won't find the same level of depth of the elder scroll series, ok a lot of it is just being pretty for the sake of it 99 on npcs are there just as a side dish which i honestly find annoying but you cannot argue that the main story and all the side quests that ultimately are part of it are awesome, full of memorable characters, wacky dialogues and great story writing. it's an engrossing videogame like few i have played in the last few years maybe only the last of us and hzd hooked me the same way. don't believe the hype nor the haters, just enjoy it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-10,"cyberpunk 2077 can get boring after the first half an hour. i would rather cdpr to be delayed with another year to master the game instead of getting this. patches don't matter since they fix bugs and glitches they won't change how the game works or add new content excluding future dlcs. yes, it succeeded but if all players are disappointed and critics write fake reviews what's the point? cyberpunk is way into rpg and grinding not actually immersing yourself into night city. everything in the game feels like it tries its hardest to keep you doing the story campaign because everything else is just not interactable or not working. you will notice the notdoneright parts when you get into any conversation. there is just one line that keeps the talk progressing, other blue options are optional and they put you back to choose the yellow option. you. do. not. have. control. over. anything. the only thing i admire is that you get additional options from time to time depending on your origin nomad, corpo or streetkid but that comes rarely. the npcs you are talking to will wait for your response and will repeat some phrase and not do anything else until you answer themthe cop woman said that she doesn't have all day and still she waited me to click the response for two hours in real time. the story is fine, i will give them that, but everything else is just a watered down version of what we were promised. all beautiful until you try the openworld and discover how ugly everything is..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-10,"an honest review from someone who loved the witcher 3 and completed cyberpunk 2077. i promised i would alter this review once i have played through, and i have a few things to add. first of all, i'm usually a completionist ghost of tsushima, witcher 3, god of war but i finished the game here after roughly 48 hours. with some side gigs done not very interesting but gives eddies, all side quests and all main quests. this is, honestly, very short for an open world rpg. i heard it from someone else before, that it's short, but i didn't believe it until i played it. i personally can't fathom how another youtuber accumulated 120 hrs, because i have no interest in clearing out the map  it's just not interesting enough past the side and main quests. pros  the main story is witten really well and interesting  and i'm basically playing the game for it.  most of the characters and their backgrounds are enticing jackie, delamain, johnny silverhand, evelyn parker, alt, rogue, kerry.  the graphics are great on a topend pc with a 3070 and ryzen 3900x.  the music and soundtrack is top notch, outright amazing. cons  zombie npcs  ai and idiotic traffic  so much less impactful, quirky and lighthearted side quests in comparison to witcher 3.  the world feels just grim. and bland, and empty. everything looks very similar, it could just be another american city like las vegas.  i expected to run into interesting stories randomly while exploring the map, but i haven't yet.  lifepaths don't matter. even if you come from corpo, you still end up with a weird v street slang as if v was meant to just be a streetkid. past the first 15 minutes your background doesn't really get elaborated on anymore.  customisation basically non existent.  you also rarely get to see your character in cutscenes.  romance the options are underwhelming to say the least.  too many bugs, considering how much time they had to polish. which suggests to me they were massively behind in development schedule all along.  the ending leaves much to be desired. why? because a lot of our questions aren't getting answered, no matter which ending you'll get. cdpr decided to take you back to where you started before the last mission after you finished the main story, a design choice i absolutely disagree with. ghost of tsushima did this better heck even the witcher 3. i also can't see how they connect here in future dlcs, because the endings you can achieve for v differ greatly.  the story overall feels very linear, despite the fact you can get a bunch of different outcomes.  i don't feel the urge to 100 complete this game or replay it anytime soon. probably when a paid dlc is out. conclusion cdpr is a company that can produce great games, and we all know it. with cyberpunk, i feel like they shot themselves in the foot announcing release dates that just weren't doable. they hyped up the game too much, and invested an insane amount of money and time into marketing and keanu reeves, as much as i like him  when they should have laid low and told us we release it's when it's ready, 20212022. this is entirely, and i mean entirely, on the management and leadership ceo of cdpr. i assume it was just greed for money, nothing more or less. don't get me wrong. cyberpunk is a good, enjoyable game if you can run it well, but nothing extraordinary like the witcher 3. it basically plays like it wasn't ready to be released, and a lot of things were rushed. it feels like it got released a year or two too early. they promised us content that just isn't in the game. can it reach that legendary witcher 3god of warghost of tsushima status? i highly doubt it. but it can certainly get a lot better  with additional content which was promised and great new story dlcs. and the biggest thing is learn from this release. improve."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-07,"810. why is such an overestimate? i liked the game, but the optimization is nowhere lower, but there have been and will be bugs as in other games. but still, the plot is not very bad, the characters characters are at a height in 50 hours of one passage, i managed to become attached to many characters and experience the life of the protagonist with them. i hope the dls will not let you down and the cd project will complete this work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-07,"cyberpunk 2077 is an engaging experience unlike anything else. the open world mechanics are top notch and there is almost always something to do on the map. furthermore, we have a large number of different game paths to choose from, all of which give you a very own experience of the story. combined with the hundreds of weapons, augmentations, upgrades and side missions, there is plenty of material that will last over a long period of time. cyberpunk 2077 will definitely be remembered as one of the most significant titles in the history of gaming media."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-07,"review about game version 1.0.1 great game with a great atmosphere, music and story. sadly it lacks the last polish and has some game breaking bugs such as freezing, crashing or aiproblems. i will stop playing the game for now, because i really want to fully experience this masterpiece when it is truly finished. if cd projekt can resolve all the bugs and ai  problems it will be one of the best games i ever played and get that 1010 from me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-07,"after playing this game twice now, i have come to the conclusion that it's one hell . a very solid rpg, with incredibly well written stories and very well balanced gunplay. the world itself is like nothing i've seen in a game. a metropolitan city of towering buildings and dank slums, makes it one of the most atmospheric open world games i've ever played. after over 100 hours of gameplay, it's still a game that is breathtaking to look at. it's not without it's faults however. it's commonly known that it has a lot of bugs. these have been mostly corrected now and i have never experienced anything game breaking, thankfully. i understand that some people are annoyed by bugs or the game running badly on old machines. however, gaslighting the game and it's rpg elements, are one to ignore. just go play this game for yourself and make your own mind up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-06,i think it is a masterpiece if they introduced police ai as good other open world games and this game has great support in mods that makes the game more immersive and the story is perfect and side missions are awesome as silverhand can be seen more side missions waiting for the dlc if they jackie a story in dlc i will give this game 1010 there are less bugs than first glitches are there but not some much i think this game can be two to three times this game is good and mods make them awesome

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-04,"now the worst experience, but now about 5 months after release they have fixed some issues. but still i see some horrible things wrong with the game. ui is really weird in the beginning and takes time to used to. take a weapon wheel as an example. you have to have perfect mouse sensitivity to hit the correct weapon you want. then the menu, as ux it is trash. takes too much time to realize and then you have to interact with it a lot. then why cant i un check missions so they don't appear on my map all the time? i would like to explore more but the markings really are annoying. the story is interesting and it is almost the only thing that keeps me playing. performance on rtx 2080 and 9th i7 is decent but i am still experiencing small fps drops in some areas. please let me un check the quests ffs. and still can't believe that experienced studio didn't organize the development better and released completely broken piece of ..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-03,"feel like a scam, bugs, hype. so sad but its true. cd projekt red, please, do not think everything can be fixed like the witcher 3."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-03,"es un videojuego muy divertido, para nada es lo que se esperaba, ni creo que cambiara a la industria, ni es tan complejo o rompedor, pero tampoco significa que sea un mal juego, tiene una buena historia, la jugabilidad es buena, grficamente es increble, y por lo menos mi experiencia con los bugs no fue tan mala aunque si tuve varios, algunos muy molestos."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-03,"a 610 game that is brought down by an overabundance of bugs and glitches. the gameplay is completely fine, but less interesting than any other fps of the last couple of generations. the story moves way too quickly, and the side quests, while sometimes fun, don't really convince me that this is a living world. there is also the issue of cd projekt red trying to both make a blank canvas and a fleshed out character in v. we can customize himher, yet it is very obvious from dialogue that he has a personality out of our control. the combination is a very frustrating experience of trying to roleplay and being forced into this bland and opinionated character. the rpg elements are basically nonexistent, with skill trees mostly providing insignificant percentage upgrades, and rarer weapons feeling completely useless due to the loot distribution. the highlight of the game is how the city looks while not in motion. cdpr use beautiful colours and advanced techniques to make the city look beautiful, and yet it feels completely lifeless. when you see all of the npcs walking around as if they have a completely random path you feel like you're playing a game that should predate even oblivion. all in all this is a very flawed game that i don't think will be fixed in the foreseeable future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-03,this game has lot of bugs maybe in the future this can be really really good but in 20 21 this game is
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-02,"the good  amazing visual design  weapons are fun to use  cyberpunk. not many games in this genre  atmosphere. you can stop at almost any place in this world and the view is breathtaking, the back alleys neon is a true depiction of gibson's acid dream. top notch  graphics  some characters and dialogues are great. some side missions are fun. the bad  bugs. game breaking. immersion ruining. save breaking. not working skills. all and everything you can possibly imagine that can break in a game can and will break in cyberpunk. mafia 3 on release was better.  people talk all the time over each other. get stuck in animations, tpose  shallowest open world you can find in the video games. wide as an ocean deep as a puddle.  silverhand's character is just plain badly written. his character developing is random.  terrible vehicle controls, small minimap you have to stare at all the time and still miss the turns  no character customization.  no vehicle customization.  no apartmentreal estate customization  no full respec feature in a game with 8 hour prologue until you can play it  utterly, hilariously dumb ai.  some perks simply don't work  other perks are simply useless  radio music is 90 royalty free 'beepboop'  story is extremely linear, choices don't matter  stealthhacker gameplay is boring.  no role playing. you can only refuse the job and fail the quest. that's the only choice this game gives you. so no matter how you play your character if you want to see game's content you have to agree to everything.  terrible ghosting with dlss. unplayable even on top rigs without dlss  overly sexualized cyberpunk dystopia with 3 characters to have sex withd  0, i mean zero npc interaction. they disappear into thin air, mindlessly walk around. same models are repeated a lot.  minimal replayability  blur filter applied on screen  90 of the stuff this product was advertised for is either missing, doesn't work or looks like was never even planned for the verdict this game is advertised as an open world rpg and if you treat it like that it miserably fails. if you treat this game as deus ex on steroids and you want to enjoy some good cyberpunk graphics then you might enjoy this game. i certainly don't regret buying it, i do regret though what it is and what it was promised to be. hint do not play stealth hacker character. game has no proper respec and until you realize what this game is it's going to be too late and you will have to replay it like i had. use your nvidia filters to remove the blur filter that like weird plastic bag covers your screen. enjoy the characters, the dialogues, the story and side missions. try to ignore the open world. good luck!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-02,"well, it's a good game if you have good specs. the game is pretty good but they should have added more story and make it less glitchy. i had some of the recommended settings and ran decent, but i do not recommend this game to people who have below the average specs."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-01,zero replayability value. weak side quests. no reason to return to the game after finishing the main campaign. the game is still bugridden gog patch 1.22. awful cops pursue and vehicle driving mechanics.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-05-01,"cyberpunk was presented as an open world rpg, most of the mechanics of cyberpunk don't respect what cd projekt red promised. the choises in the dialogues don't make you go in other directions, the choices are basically useless. the shooting isn't much good, there are games with a better gunplay. once you create your character you will never be able to personalize the physical attributeslike hair, face and anything else. in a rpg where you can be ''everything you want''like they said you can't be a criminal for the bad ai and the bad police that teleports near the player, in fact you can't do a chase like in gta, in this you have to much limitations, the police is jesus christ.i don't reccomend this game, there are games that have deeper mechanics than cyberpunk 2077. at least there is keanu reeves but he has an ugly face in this game. this game will be like skyrim, if you want to play i think you have to wait until the mod community does something for making it more playable and enjoyble. buy this game when is on steam sales."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-30,"the game is amazing. possible one of the best games ever made. great story telling, choices and consequences that matter, and which npcs react to. unique endings for your choices. even the bad ending was so good. keep it up cdpr!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-29,it is a good game with a compelling story. it is easy to care for the npc's you meet. and it is fun to build characters. there are some rough spots in the mechanics and some systems that aren't fully fleshed out yet. i believe that cdproject red will fix more in time. each improvement patch just gives me a chance to start a new toon and work a different build. games improved since its release. i've become addicted to this game and im gonna waist half my life playing this game with nothing on but a smile on my face. its more than worth it.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-29,"a good game with some great moments and greater characters, undermined by medicore gameplay and technical issues. cyberpunk 2077 is certainly a good game and an enjoyable experience. but just how much depends on how many technical issues you encounter. i was lucky enough to only experience a few during my playtime. but experiences vary. but what bugs me most aren't the technical issues. it's that cyberware, even in its best moments, never quite lives up to its full potential. it's always good, but never great. even the best characters like johnny, jacky, judy and panam can't gloss over the rather dull gameplay that offers a lot of depth on paper, but no in play. equally, the openworld is really little more than a facade, never more than an inch deep. it's a bummer trying to imagine what could have been with just a little more focus."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-29,"i'm still not sure if i like this game or not. but i keep playing it, so i probably do. the start is really slow. after about 5 hours i was ready to give up because i thought that was how the entire game would be and i wasn't impressed. it got better though. i do like the story, the main quests and some of the smaller quests too. most of the characters are interesting. and the design of night city is amazing. but it's not what i expected. hype hurt it a lot. and i don't think it's on par with the likes of witcher 3. there is some aggravating stuff. i wish people would stop calling v in the worst moments, i'm trying to have a serious conversation with someone only to be interrupted by a gig i don't really want to do, and i can't hear what the character is saying. and stop changing my tracked quests just because some low level  called me. if i want to track the quest, i will click on it in the journal. there are plenty of visual bugs and i started playing after the 1.2 patch, and even some potentially game breaking ones character wouldn't talk to me so i couldn't finish a quest. but reloading an earlier save helped. some of the physics are a joke. and the npc ai is so stupid. your background doesn't matter, and some of the quests don't seem to lead anywhere. it is fun to play, but it definitely doesn't live up to the hype and it's not going to be one of my favourite games. but it's not as terrible as some people say. still, i'm glad i got the game on sale."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-28,"man what a dissapointment. don't get me wrong. i loved the witcher, not just the witcher 3, but i played since the start, both 1 and 2 as well. so expectations were high. cd projekt red felt like one of the few good companies left. man was i wrong. cyberpunk is an absolute joke. there are three good things with the game. the first hour of gameplay. the enviromentartstyle looks cool as hell and really breathtaking at times get it? and the guns feel alright. that's it. so what are the negative things with cyberpunk?  terrible character customization not even zoom or bodytypes? really? really? 2021 and dragon age from 2009 has better customization  terrible ai. games like gta which came out years ago has better ai especially in city streets, how they react to situations. this is an absolute disaster in cyberpunk. police who don't care if you shoot someone infront of them, people who only have one animation if you shoot a car. police spawning and directly starting to shoot you. it's just so friggin terrible. hell even oblivion had a go to jail system  stop you violated the law.  music is terrible. the witcher had some of the greatest music in gaming, probably because it's was a folkband from poland making most of the music and not the composer. because man is the soundtrack to cyberpunk bad. where are the vangelismass effect big dreamy 80's inspired synth soundtrack? nowhere to be found. instead with are left with a bunch of screechy bs which nobody with half an ear can like, you just want to turn the radio right off as soon as you get into a car to add to it. mass effect 13 has so much better music. hell even bladerunner from like 97 does.  lack of choice. there is no choice at all. you are just allowed one option all the time. doesn't matter what you do.  your actions don't matter. run into someone with your car? no problem. run a red light? no problem. shoot a whole gang up? no problem you will just get a topjob from their boss anyway 5 min later. want to say something cool in a conversation? sorry you are only allowed one option. even wasteland 3 did this so much better.  no factions !?. i thought i could choose to become a corp and that it would be a faction and mean something, that the story would build around your choice... wow i get a 10 min intro and a useless option every 20th conversation to say something related to corp knowledge that doesnt matter anyway.... truly immersive. the quests are terrible. gigs and other things, feels like a bad ubisoft game most of the time.  censorship of sex and other things like shooting wounds, if you shoot someone.. they don't even get a wound. we have a dark gritty world, but still censorship? a world full of sex and degeneracy as the devs put it in like 2013, but everything is censored. what a joke.  the animations are ok at best.  you cannot steal cars and keep them or have some kind of system for it? why even buy cars when you can just steal any car all the time?  no factions as was promised. wanted to be a corp? too bad, it doesn't matter one fuing bit.  story is overall bad and the storymoments are mediocre at best. with few exceptions. there are good moments to be fair, but they are way too far between. most characters are boring and uninteresting. with few exceptions, for example a certain person who doesn't stick around for very long. i played 3540 hours. didn't even want to go back to the game. i even tried to really like this game, but it's impossible. so i uninstalled and haven't looked back. biggest gaming dissapointment ever."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-26,"i am one of the victims of the cdpr marketing team that brought me so much hype for years and rooted for this game to be a goty candidate. however, i think an honest review would be somehow a significant contribution to those who are thinking of getting this game. i started playing this 3 months after its release in hopes that the bugs are fixed, but there still a lot of them to be named. it took me 70 hours to finish the main storyline along with 90 of the sidequests. i pay attention very well with the dialogues and the story of course. i don't speed run stuff. 3 points that i take out is mostly from the disappointing features that was promised from the trailers and teaser footage 2 years back. i do not think that the bugs are what's making this release a controversy. for me it was the overpromised and also the free world doesn't feel its alive. there are numerous instances where you would encounter npcs who would literally say what can i say? when you try to interact with them. ridiculous for a 1liner dialogue. there were instances where you would see a group of identical kids yes, identical... exact models of about two or three look alike npcs in one location.. literally just standing there and doing nothing. there are a lot of places that it felt like they were placed there just for the sake of it. not even moving or talking. if you pay attention to the teasers and interviews, they aimed to make the city feel alive and seamless. but it was the contrary, a lot of it were inaccessible and just lacked life for the most parts. for the positive points, i think the story were crafted and very innovative. this was a whole new experience for a storytelling rpg game for me and i enjoyed it. the main questline is packed with action and character development. same goes with the sidequests. somehow, the sidequests had significant impact towards your main progression. that i believe have met what they promised. without spoilers and overall, i would recommend this game and look forward for its future content and updates. i must say, it was a disappointing launch and overpromised features. but i believe in redemption especially for a game dev who crafted the witcher 3."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-19,"i'm probably not the only one who has been waiting for cyberpunk 2077 for years. hype would be unreal and expectations unleashed. i was probably one of the few to be satisfied, but a few things disappointed me. i would start with the technical state of the game. needless to say, i played the game on pc! from what i was watching, the game ran terribly, even unplayably, on the consoles. i was almost without a problem on the pc, but it may also be because i waited and played the game about 2 weeks after the release and waited for a few patches. here and there i came across an enemy man flying through walls or unfinished textures on a map, which were in play until recently at the time of writing this review. perhaps the biggest problem i noticed in the side task is a pity. the side games are almost like main missions and they are really sophisticated and they are not the classic repetitive tasks we are used to from other games. no. here the authors approached with love and it is true that the side tasks simply have a story. it's a pity that i just had one bug and couldn't play it, even after loading the . lucky it wasn't the main mission. this was perhaps the biggest problem i personally noticed in the game. these were technical problems and now the problems of the game and these are the npcs. look, i won't lie to you. i wouldn't notice it myself, because i just did missions and didn't look at passing npcs, which are fine at first glance, but if you start researching them in detail, you'll find that they often go round and round. in my opinion, this wouldn't be such a problem, but the problem is that the cdprs promised how several npcs in the game would have their daily routine and several of them would be different and behave the same way. the biggest massacre was perhaps the police, which usually appear directly behind you. it just sleeps and nothing more. so i solidly criticized the game, but now for the good side. what immediately took my breath away was the story! maybe i'm alone, but in my opinion it was really luxurious and i didn't expect parts of the game in parts and overall. of course nothing masterful. i'm not saying these are cutscenes at the rockstar or even naughty dog level. not at all! i'm just saying that a few scenes surprised me, especially with john silverhand. i will no longer spoiler you, but simply a story of delight, but there is also one unpleasant thing. the game has 3 acts. the story is being built and is being built, and in the third act it is as if it has really started and you don't even hope and the game is over. after finishing the game, i just said that's all? the game is kind of short and i'm not saying it's wrong. i understand the purpose of the authors. they wanted to make the game shorter and therefore more accessible to more players to complete the game compared to the sorcerer 3, for example, but it occurred to me that the story was not shortened, but simply torn off. as if something was missing. i thought it was just a dream, but then it popped up on the internet that there should have been 5 attacks in the game instead of three, which would make sense and it's a shame. but what's wrong maybe a few bugs here and there is the atmosphere. this is one of the best i've ever experienced. night city has its charm and all the lights and especially the music while driving in the car is, in my opinion, as keanu would say breathtaking! i've already bitten a car ride, which i was happy with. for example, such a watch dogs, in my opinion, really had no control over the vehicle, but this is not the case and the cars handled me well. the fact that in the end we can't tune our car what we already have. we can still buy cars and get proper sports cars. but if you are not driving in the atmospheric night city or outside in the desert, which is also luxurious, by the way, you will move with the help of a walker and there will be enemas who will want to give you a handle and you will be forced to pull the quarry. the weapons here are one poem and especially one hoho. it's something. i'll tell you that these are mantis blades, which you can find in one location in the game, and i personally recommend that you do it as soon as possible, because chopping enemies with this toy is really a feast for the eyes. i really felt like a real samurai, even when you walk into a club where the darkness is and the neons are lit and the music is playing and i'm sorry. i got carried away. overall, cyberpunk 2077 is for me, despite the state of the game and everything possible, a great game, which probably needed even more time, although i do not know, because 9 years of development is really a massacre. maybe if i had 10 rounds, then not only would the game be more finetuned, but it would also be ranked at 10."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-17,"if you picked this game up for the same reasons you purchased grand theft auto 5, you're going to be sorely disappointed. if you went into this expecting an emotionally driven story with memorable and unique characters, top notch voice acting performances and compelling dialogue, in the same vein as games like mass effect or the cult classic vampire the masquerade bloodlines, you're going to love it. on a mid to high range pc, it runs beautifully. the ost and radio music selection is the best i've heard in any open world game. so much so that i've discovered new musical artists that i would have never listened to if not for this game. grimes is a gem. but, this game isn't perfect. there are many small annoyances that might frustrate some players, like not being able to pick up a clearly lootable item, perks that just don't work, a largely noninteractive open world, or the clunky user interface. luckily, these are all things that can and will be fixed. as a consumer, it's up to you to determine if these issues are a deal breaker. for me, i couldn't imagine letting these minor problems prevent me from experiencing this breathtaking world. i look forward to following the future of this franchise."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-08,"cd projekt red's longawaited dystopian futuristic title is an engaging experience, only embittered by technical issues that may or may not be frequent depending on how the game performs in your pc hardware. i just wish they didn't rush it out and spent more time polishing out the game, addressing the bugs, glitches, performance problems and quality of life issues. additionally, the design of the main quest was too linear for i would assume a lot of rpg fans' liking and expectations, but the quality of the side content this game has makes up for it anyway."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-07,"this game is a steaming pile of crap and cd project is a garbage company for releasing it in this condition, nevermind on what is it the 3rd patch? absolutely disgraceful. aside from the buggy gameplay, the real dealbreaker for me is the nonmappable controls on pc! yes you read that right !! i play with arrowkeys and number pad none of which are mappable. this was inexcusable in 1998 how in bloody hell can you clowns at project red release a game in 2020 lacking it? what a joke and the laugh apparently is on me since i paid for this worthless unplayable for me game. i now sincerely regret buying this and i really regret not trying to play it before the return period ran out... bunch of scumbag thieves."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-07,"i wouldn't say that the game is as bad as some reviews says, but it is for sure not what it was meant to be. i didn't finish the game, but i will wait for the next gen update and then i'll give it a second chance. but so far i experienced a lot of bugs, dumb ai, and a lack of content that was promised. although i enjoyed the story."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-06,"they promise a lot and they lied. not the bugs are the problem but the very poor ai, an open world from the year 2000 gothic 2 have better daily routines for npc and more dinamic open world then this and that game is from 2005 and poor mechanics."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-05,i think this game was so overhyped but it was terrible it had like no content around it and it was just boring. now this is just my opinion but i think it's boring
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-04,"if you look at the profiles of the vast majority of user reviewers giving this a 10, they're all obviously bot or fake accounts with a small number of reviews  many with only a single one for 2077. this only happens when a company is spending serious cash to furiously paper over their worst blunders. it's not a good look, cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-04,"exploring night city is an unparalleled joy, depicting a dystopian world with an unmatched level of detail in the genre. i lost myself for hours, but such immersion also unveiled a number of deeper issues with its lacklustre themes and problematic writing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-04,fantastic experience! cyberpunk 2077 it's an extraordinary game that never ever been created before!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-04,"the game lacks content, the city is dead, the npcs cannot walk properly or drive. the quests have except for very few a single outcome. the few car chases are all prescripted and user activity during them does not matter. there are still plenty of bugs, even after 1.2 patch. also the initial corponomadstreetkid choice does not matter at all. it is not normal for stock prices plummet down by 60 after you launch your main product which you have been working on for 8 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-03,"when we dont look at the glitchs, its a ideal game with great story. cdprojekt must corrected game and it will be a game of the year"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-03,"to charge 60 for such a buggy mess shouldn't be supported. i stopped playing because of the constant gameimmersion breaking stuff. after finishing the game with all its endings i have to say that it is mediocre at best. it's not worth 60. and it'll take cdpr years to fix the bugs in this game. the 1.2 patch didn't change anything for me. still a bugglitch even gamebreaking ones every god damn minute... i'll recoment waiting for it to be 20 or to watch a walkthough on youtube. performance wise it runs good but it should on my hardware ryzen 5800x  rtx 3080 5060fps with rtx on and dlss on quality on 1440p and ultra settings. now to the bugs ive encountered dead people with head shot off still talking. npc runs around with no weapon in hand. police ai is basically non existing npcs don't jump out of the way if i drive towards them. they jump in front of the vehicle. constantly. enemies spawn inside a wall. and i can't progress until i kill him. combat music wont stop. footstep sound disappears. every 510 minutes!! i need to reload the save game to get the sound back maybe boss health bar is stuck to the screen even after the fight.  v missing her hair in the final cutscene and yeah. there is only one cutscene in the game. dialog is missing. it just plays silence.  clothing with no icons which you cant equip bad sound mixing which leads to repetitive switching of combat and ambient tracks.  dead bodies i carry and place on the ground explode.  calling a car and a bike shortly after another results in a exploding car.  calling in a car sometimes spawns a vehicle with only 1hp i can't call a vehicle in pacifica at all.  there are many invisible walls where you can't drive through with a vehicle. for example you can't park on the parking spots at the moxies club... questitems disapearing. dialog line stuck at the end credits which caused the 40 minute long credit scene to be unskipable. so the credits were literaly longer than the end mission. wtf now to the disappointing stuff water looks soo bad in this game. it doesnt react to impacts and explosions and looks worse than vanilla skyrim. no body customization after the character creation. no tattoo studio. no barbershop. nothing disappointing dialog options. it doesnt feel like a roleplaying game. you can't play your own v. you play the v cdpr wrote for you. even the endings are the same just in another setting. bad balance. either you are too powerful for you enemies or you're getting oneshoted. save games can get corrupted if you loot too much. wtf? they have full nudity in the inventory screen but if you go into the photo mode or fp you are dressed. cdpr said that this is intentional and not a bug. why implement it if you cant even see it? what happend with coming when it's ready? cdpr has a lot of work to do. but i have no hopes. nightcity feels empty. the story is depressing and boring. you have no atatchment to npcs because most of the time you only talk to them on the phone. and you never see v's face when talking to them because there aren't any cutscenes with npc's  no 3rd person camera makes looting clothes for looks irrelevant. not even in the single cutscene in the game you'll see your outfit. tldr short, depressive, buggy mess."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-02,would have rated this game much higher if they hadn't done away with 3rd person view later in the development. by doing so they rendered it pointless to put any effort in their very cool character creation system they showed off earlier on in their development since you can't even see your character in game except a few glimpses in a couple of cutscenes. furthermore the game is empty beyond the main mission. it was clearly rushed to market given the empty promises of features that never got made and the fact it shipped as a horribly bugridden mess. cdpr really damaged their credibility and goodwill with gamers everywhere.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-01,"5 for the effort the developers put in. this is the last game i ever prebuy. the guy from w a buy wab was right, never prebuy games. this is game had potential but the world feels dead and everything and everyone seems to be on rails... a great way to ruin the immersion. i wont even mention the bugs... gta san andreas was more ambitious, better optimized, had better ai and felt alive... thats embarrassing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-01,"a maior decepo que vi na histria dos videogames. uma empresa que tinha a considerao dos seus consumidores, havia feito um tremendo sucesso com the witcher que  uma obraprima, jogou todo o respeito na lata do lixo com o desrespeito ao consumidor ocorrido no lanamento de cyberpunk 2077. o marketing trabalhou forte para vender a prvenda do jogo, mostrando um possvel jogo muito bem feito. o resultado no entanto foi extremamente abaixo do esperado um jogo completamente bugado e mal otimizado nada inovador gameplay similar a qualquer jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa genrico grfico regular nada surpreendente. somado a decepo com a qualidade em si, temos delays constantes no lanamento e patchs, remoo do suporte a mods e tentativas vergonhosas de justificar o injustificvel. o jogo chegou a ser ijogvel para muitos jogadores, j que bugs impediam a progresso na histria e o desempenho nos consoles base  ridiculamente ruim. no pc o desempenho  extremamente abaixo do esperado, chegando a ter travamentos sttutering at mesmo em pc's de altssimo nvel montados com processador intel i9. os requisitos mnimos e recomendados mais uma vez no fizeram o menor sentido, j que em ambos os casos o jogo roda mal. esse  o perfeito exemplo do que no fazer ao se lanar um jogo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-01,"the game is really not that bad without the bugs, so i stopped playing at and might continue my review later, but there is really bad things in the game like most of the dialogues are just fake choices! maybe in the end there some major choices but in most main quests and almost all side quests no matter what you choose it doesnt matter! it will be okay if this game was from small studio and they worked on it for like 1 or 2 years but for a triple a game and we waited for 7 years! and how they promised of a lot of things like you can finsh the game with only side quests and lot of promises! its just all fake! i wish they just work on quality over quantity, and never spend that big budget on false marketing. in the end besides the false marketing the game is not that bad but for all that bugs and fake choices that what kill the experience for me. plus the ai is really bad and when you talk to someone they ether ignore you or just repeat one dialogue! sometimes 2 or 3 bad ones."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-01,"this game is made with a detailed approach to development, beautiful firstperson scenes, nonlinearity in the story sections and additional quests, there is a good physics of transport depending on its type and price. bugs that are on the release for a certain period of time will fix as it was with the witcher 3 on the release."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-04-01,"such a disappointing title. expectations were too high, but the result is just the worst. the game is a laggy, buggy, clunky mess. project red, get your  together and make a new witcher game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-31,"it's a great game. visually stunning. a masterpiece of design and technical achievement. sure there are crazy bugs and things blowing up out of nowhere. but so what? in fact, thank you!! i enjoyed it more than i thought i would. broken games are the best games to play, they are the most fun. it was so much fun playing this awesome title in december. i remember binging for days without sleep like i used to do with world of warcraft. it's not healthy, but the content kept me intrigued and the style was ground breaking. i enjoyed breaking the  out of the pistol criticals, and the map glitch for free money. it was the best beta test ever. people crying are spoiled brats with bath salts up their , no joke this is exactly what these people are. they cannot even begin to fathom the hard core level of work that needs to be done to make even this broken version of the game playable. the best part is i know cdpr are going to absolutely balance and finalize this masterpiece to infinity and beyond. just wait 'til multiplayer starts. hehe. people have no clue where this game is going. the engine itself is groundbreaking, and will forever change the landscape of quality triple a titles. even with all the brokenness and bugs, i was able to finish the main story line and 5060 of side quests within a few weeks. game of the year for sure, no doubt in my mind. keep up the hard work cdpr, we love what you do!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-31,there is so many bugs that they make a game unplayable. i was playing on both midrange and highend pc hardware and with both sets there were a lot of different bugs completely eliminating the immersion and spoiling the gaming experience. it was a great idea and i see the potential in this game but there is so much cut out content in comparison to what was promise and so many things that were told that they are already implemented and tested to finally don't appear in final game.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-31,great storyline. i have a lot of fun to playing this game. in my personal opinion best game of 2020.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-30,"it's buggy, it's far from perfect  but it's nonetheless a great game and a great experience. cd projekt red seem to keep their promise  with patch 1.2 a great number of issues have been fixed, but there ist still plenty of work left. but if you have the hardware for it  and if you didn't buy into the hype expecting a grand theft redemption night city  i can fully recommend the game even in its current state."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-29,"don't come to this game if you're looking for a well written story, complex choices that matter, or any of the things that were promised in the years leading up to release. when it works, cyberpunk is essentially a borderlands type grind, but in a much prettier setting. the a.i. might as well be lobotomized that's how bad it is. but the gameplay loop can be fun and even thrilling at times thanks to some inventive mechanics quickhacking and visceral weapons katanas. you also get a double jump perk later in the game that adds an unexpected level of verticality to exploring the city. unfortunately, that's really all there is. the story feels like it was written by a team of incel bound teenagers who got handed a hat full of edgy topics to choose fromshoehorned into an awkward, by the numbers, cyber anime plot we get quests involving sextrafficking and kidnapping, government corruption, betrayal, the metaphysical implications of becoming more and more dependent on machine and tech, murder for hire, insurance schemes etc. but cyberpunk handles its adult centric material with the tact of a child, as allaround meh protagonist, v, offers up snark and more snarkno matter how serious the situation is. tonally, the game is wildly inconsistent. that being said, it's impossible to take any of this seriously when your questgiver starts crashing through the geometry during a single malt diatribe, or when the person you were meant to kill in a side mission just disappears from the map entirely, or when a dialogue option for an important quest fails to appear without a series of work arounds and resets. you will restart your save, and restart often. cyberpunk is very fragile, and you can break its systems often without even trying. keanu didn't bring anything to the game for me either. he's so similar to v in tone and mood that it's almost like hearing the exact same nihilistic shtick, but in stereo. i wanted to turn him off, but he's integral to the plot, so no can do on that. overall, i find it mindbaffling that anyone could give this game a score above an 8, even when it works. there's just not much here. the game even goes as far as to label the many cars you can buy as individual sidequests. in a game with horrendous driving mechanics though 1st person on a motorcycle can be fun. that just goes to show how padded and unfinished cyberpunk is. even when everything's working, this is hardly the future of gaming. adjust your expectations, and you might have some fun. otherwise, you'll be wondering why this took over 7 years to make."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-29,"sorry for my preintermediet cyberpunk is a miracle of the gaming industry, but it has small bugs and unpleasant things like that you can't improve cars or change your character's hairstyle. but heroes are the soul of this game! in not one of the more than a hundred games i have played, i have not seen such wellwritten characters. i really fell in love with the character and appearance of panam palmer i hope this is normal, and after this love line i fell into a weekly depression, this is how i liked this character, i really liked judy and rivor, they are very haresmatic, they have their own past , future, present, ambitions, dreams. after a couple of minutes of playing, you completely immerse yourself in this most atmospheric gaming world, and you begin to feel and associate yourself with v 100. and when i finished the game, i just could not hold back my emotions and burst into tears, i cried for about 2 hours when i finished the game, and then again fell into a monthly depression. i could not forget the friends and love of my character, and this wonderful story will always remain in my heart. i wish only one thing, that you cannot erase your memory and replay the game again. as i write this post, a tear involuntarily flows down my cheek when i remember this story. if you still have not passed it, then i envy you very much, it will be the best that you will play, this game has surpassed even the witcher in terms of the plot level. when i was depressed, i remembered my v, who never gave up and went to his goal, this pulled me out of that state. i don't even bother that the virtual character helped me, but after all, v was me. cdpr i am very grateful to you for my most loved game and i say this with pride, because there are one in hundreds of such games. i hope you will fix a couple of bugs, which i met no more than 7 in the whole game, and release a sequel to this masterpiece. cyberpunk  the most atmospheric, game where you fully feel and associate yourself with v, a game in which you will not meet such wellmade characters, a game where each npc has its own story. cyberpunk you are my favorite game and i say it with pride! thanks cdpr! hello from ukraine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-29,"i being playing it for almost a month now and i love it, im a great fan of gta, far cry or even watch dogs, but this is the best open space game ever, the city is unveliable, the missions are great, the fights are unbelievable.... totally recommended in pc i use an old laptop with geforce now and the rtx ray trazing is crazy. totally recommended"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-27,the game feels so lifeless. 1 dead civilian then the whole police department is at your back and kills you in seconds. the missions are not engaging. the openworld is boring and so is the story. i am just gonna replay witcher 3.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-27,"this game was a lot of fun. like, spend 30 consecutive hours playing nothing but side content and love it levels of fun. yeah, there's plenty of glitches and bugs that can be annoying when they happen, but for me, they never ruined the overall experience. fantastic story, great characters, bangin soundtrack, and plenty more. highly recommend."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-26,this is not what we saw in trailers and this is not a rpg. all aspect of the game a better on other games...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-26,"here comes a brand new ip from a company that did so well with their work on the witcher series. witcher 3 and its dlc being one of my favorite and most memorable gaming enjoyments of recent years. cyberpunk was inflated and over advertised to be this huge new game that was going to blow minds. sadly it was nothing like it was hyped up to be and crashed very flat over all. i sat trying to keep playing the game through hours and hours in respect of cd red and the faith in their company but i reached a point i just stopped playing without finishing the game. before even starting into the many issues with the game, the main reason for stopping was just not being interested in the main story at all. i give the game little credit for the story not being how i expected from the endless trailers we were shown. playing a mercenary whose main goal was to make a name for yourself just felt boring and meaningless when the game lacked connection or an interest into the world around it. nightcity was just a playground of adultsexual billboards or nightclubs with violence and technology thrown into a blender. one day after mindlessly doing another side quest of killing person x because person y was going to pay me i turned off the game and turned on another game and automatically felt happier just caring about that world. bugs. glitches. more bugs. more glitches. the problems were endless. lips not moving when characters were speaking. character models clipping through stationary objects that would cause random things to fly around. several points of audio just being absent. looting radius for items being completely broken or away from the actual object laying on the ground. quest givers or fixers in cyberpunk being lagged behind the quest you are working on, giving you dialogue from a previous quest you already did. i personally ran into a couple game breaking bugs that made the game impossible to play or advance in till a patch was released several days later. skin textures clipping off character models during small cutscenes. the list could go on and on for the issues with this game. this game wasn't all bad and offered some neat skill trees for their minimal rpg element. hacking gameplay was fun and thematic to the game while weapons were fun to play around with. but not much else stood out about this game and i doubt i'll ever pick it back up after many content patches are released. i dont blame the whole company for this disaster that was shipped to us. i blame the financialmarketing team for pushing out a game that was not ready. i also blame the public for being so greedy nowadays and not wanting to wait for something to come out. you can tell this was a passion project by cd red that if given the full time it needed could have been an interesting game but instead was forced to rush the game and cut so much content from the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-26,"as of december 23rd the game had so much potential but lacked in so many areas the story, voice acting and the map are great as the city feels alive as. however there are still so many bugs like rendering issues are very frequent crashing is a bit of an issue but it hasn't happened much recently and other then bugs, the driving is very clunky, the gun play and gun fights get boring very quickly and the progression is not extremely clear and finally physics aren't very modern and gta 4 and 5 had way better physics. but the story does help with looking past these issues as all of the endings are good and there is a large enough variety."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-26,"well there is a very big conflict going on about this game so i am gonna give you the the bottomline with sincerity, if you are looking for a perfect story that respect your mind, and not just tells you do that grab that and go there so you have to the right place. perfect story if you are looking for good side quests which can be another completely game full of story, action, has meaning to the world you live in, then you have came to the right place. those things what makes cyberpunk unique the story, the world and the side quests. the cons well, you as all of you know 1the bugs 2the gameplay is not what they promised us 3the variety in the game in general which means lack of weapons and cars ecc. 4the world isn't that alive although they promised it will be so much attractive and alive but at least it reflect the aspect of the game. i hope you try it out specially if you love drama action and if you are an emotional person like me  because your emotions will be  up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-26,great story and atmosphere! one of the best games i played so far. can not understand how so much people give a 0 rating for this masterpiece.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-25,"cyberpunk 2077 is advertised as an action rpg when in truth the rpg is extremely light to non existent the game is flashy and the graphics are nice but that's all its got going for it story is just ok with obvious endings and the city they created is empty and dead with nothing to do outside of repetitive side missions or the extremely short and very linear story that offers no challenge when we add that to all the bugs ,glitches ,crashes and broken systems over 30 skills just don't work broken policethey spawn from nowhere dont drive any of the vehicles created for them and attack at random broken citizen aidespite cdpr saying that the npcs have lives and routines driving is a chore since the minimap does not zoom out high chance of clipping through the map at any time any summoned vehicle has a chance or driving past you and not stopping when you add all the issues together you end up with a very weak game that so far after over three months of release has yet to be fixed and a company that seems more interested in pr stunts than fixing the game and i am very surprised its only the ps store that removed it from sale cdpr are great at marketingsure it vial outright lying and misleading consumers but not so great at making a game that works"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-25,"this game is only 1010 for me. as a kid, i read a bunch of books about cyberpunk and science fiction like neal stephenson. and this game just showed me my dreams, put me in the world that i envisioned"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-24,for the first and maybe last time don't judge the game by score just play it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-24,"it's like netflix movie the game. but why would you spend your time in bad city with bad people, anyway? real people especially, say, class of people who work in corporations don't talk like that. some work should have been done on screenplay and dialogues i wanna go mono suarezz! anyhow, there's no point spending a lot of time in world that's ugly with bad people. we play games so we avoid that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-24,"it's good but not as good as they showed us, this is why first the story is good, good characters, but at the end it's not memorizable. now let's begin with the worst parts. the bugs are something it's in every game, but this game has many of them, like it was developed by an indie studio. maybe they fixed ones, but when i played on its release there were manyyyyy bugs. now talking about physics and ai, these things just terrible, compare to gta 5, it's just shameful, 'cause cd project told us their game was gonna be the next generation of open world games. spoiler it wasnt. i mean, the ai it's poor, you cannot interact with any of the npc's, their intellingece it's less than a npc from gta san andrea's. the physics are horrible, to resume this, i recommend you to search a comparative from gta 5 vs this game on yt. the enviroment it's cool, too much effort in that but at the end you cant do too much with that. because whe you finished al the game theres no more reason to still playing. no online, no minigames, you cannot buy choppers, boats, etc. what does it mean? you unistall the game. cyberpunk taught me not get hyped too soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-23,u ana kadar grdm en kt oyun ac unity bile bu oyundan daha iyidir karakterlerin motivasyonlar boktan rpg ye dair herey ilzyondan ibaret tek kurun skmadan oyunu mermilerden yumurlaklardan kaarak bitirebiliyorsun hi bir sikile basma oyunda hic bir sey degimiyor buglardan sz etmiyorum bile oyun sektr batarsa bu oyun yznden batcak yada bu oyun yznden daha kt oyunlar grcez bu oyuna 10 basan mecralarn alay da yalanc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-23,"this game is a mess and to all those that gave it a high rating, you are why gaming is dying! you're literally sending signals to cdpr that it's ok that they rushed the game out full of bugs, and in an unplayable state for consoles most pc users also ran into glitches too. the games story is boring and there is no actual diversity of outcomes based on your choices. all the stories are basically the same after the first 30 minutes of gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-23,"the story is great. top. a masterpiece. yet,  too less than they promised"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-22,"overall feeling 24 hours after completion deep disappointment pros romance options, graphics, ending was somewhat satisfying depending on your choice cons boring world, boring vehicle action, boring combat, boring loot, ridiculous unforgivable bugs even as late as 32221 , keanus phonedin performance, sopranosthemed voice for the male player character this games hype was legendary. sadly, it will go down as one the biggest failures of all time, gaming or otherwise. the bugs were annoying and completely unforgivable. it was so bad that now my strategy for all future releases of cd project red will be to wait at least 6 months before playing any of their games, if i dont wait long enough to buy it at a 50 discount. bugs aside, i came into this experience expecting something comparable to the witcher 3. it was not. the main character was not someone i cared about his companions i had little empathy for. the story and side quests were not captivating. the game itself was interesting enough to keep me moderately entertained for about 10 hours. the final 20 hours were a chore, and i stopped playing for a few months after the 20 hour mark. the only thing i liked about this game were the romance options. the relationshipbuilding via quest chain was more fleshed out than other titles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-22,"best game i've ever played. need to upgrade my pc immediatelly  much better than mass effect, skyrim or gta. story, side missions  i want more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-21,"it's just broken. but even if you fixed all the bugs the content wouldn't be enough. it's to limited, all you can be is just a mercenary. also when people call you what's the point of answering or even having the ability to answer the call when it's automatically does that without you meaning that you have to talk to everyone."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-21,"what a complete disappointment. the worst so called aaa title that i played. i've completed boring the story, but luckily i didn't waste any time on side quests."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-21,"this game is amazing, i've never had this emotional approach to any other game before. the game world is ok, despite the fact that i am not a fan of the future approach, the characters are written in a great way, when i met them or entered into various relationships i felt that it was me and not v, but this was the intention of the creators and they were 100 successful . the game has advantages and disadvantages, the disadvantages are mainly bugs i have met some of them are not harmful and taking into account future patches they will be fixed, so i will not deduct the assessment for it. to sum up the game 1110, my expectations met, applause cd projekt red, i keep my fingers crossed for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-21,"really not as bad as people make it out to be. give it a try, you won't regret it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-21,"the story, soundtrack, music, environment, art design, voice acting, characters hard carry this game. a shame the launch it had, but this game i feel that it deserves much more and i hope that cdpr does not give up and continue optimizing and improving the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-20,"no choices, no atmosphere, no new ideas, no interesting side quests, and its even not a cyberpunk setting. night city is a sunny, colorfull, empty, chaotic random"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-20,"awesome game, best game 20202021.  incredible graphic level  night city so awesome, much details of environment.  great ost  good storyline and not bad sidestories and about problems. have a many visual bugs and if you can't ignored you have some bad feelings, i think main story was very short, many information on notes and side quests, and if you just run main story, you lose many details of this world, and i think we need more choice metter dialogs. but i not waiting from cp77 choice metter crpg like balgurs gate 3 or pathfinder, so it's no problem from me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-20,"the story is not as interesting as possible. no choice. opponents cannot do anything to the player. how could cd project do this? after the witcher 3, i don't believe they are the same studio. never again in my life will i buy your games, much less preorders."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-19,"overhyped trash. ai is awful. game is full of bugs. no idea how this game has such a high score. oh yeah  it's because critics are paid money to bring the score higher. watch beatemups on youtube's review about this atrocity that cdpr dare call a game. the game is missing 70 of the content they promised. the bugs overshadow how terrible this game is and how much they actually under delivered. anyone that fails to see this is clearly a moron that can't see past pretty graphics. this is an unfinished tech demo, not a 50 game. fking thieves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-19,"i put this opinion after playing 220 hours and not having finished even 23 of the game. despite the numerous minor bugs that it has on pc and that the missions do not reach the level of those of the witcher 3 where the story was told by the characters and you did not have to read it on boring pen drives, it is an absorbing game and addictive in a city where you never stop discovering new and amazing places, a wonderful game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-18,"one of the worst games i've ever played. over promise and under deliver, they should have just let the fans whine while they pushed it back because this game needed at least 3 more years of work. you know you have a giant turd on your hands when a game like sleeping dogs released in 2012 has a more alive feeling city than night city. the npc's are terrible, some cringe inducing dialogue, loading in makes the rendering of the city looks like clay. but hey, they made witcher 3 and it has keanu reeves, so who cares, right? cdpr can and could have done so, so much better, 010."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-18,"graphic is top notch, cyberpunk 2077 will stay as the best looking pc for a long time to come. 1010 story is great, it was a really bittersweet experience playing through cp2077 main storyline. 910 side quests are abundant, but only a fews of them are really memorable. 710 bugs are aplenty at launch but they are not all that annoying. 510 pc optimization is awesome, game loading is very quick and graphic option can be changed effortlessly. 1010. overall a 910 until cdpr fixes everything and it could easily be a 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-18,"it's just a protest vote. totally disappointment broken promises literally unplayable for the bugs  hilarious ia  is not a gdr, it's a an action open world. your decision will not influence the storyline"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-18,"this game is a masterpiece and the best game of 2020 ... no matter how much i praise the game, i know gotys first chance next year and i hope he gets it right"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-17,"strong game play and great story with lots of other out there missions and fun. this game i will have to pass more than one month, i'm thrilled!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-17,empty game...dead....nothing to  interactivity..nothing...only story is good
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-17,"unfinished and such a shame, given the potential this game had. my sympathies go out to console gamers who had it worse than pc gamers. the trust and reputation that was destroyed with this mediocre product is so disappointing. further evidence to trust no games producer and always buy after launch, never preorder."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-16,"game looks pretty.. thats about it pretty much every other aspect of the game like story, combat, music , rpg mechanichs, choise etc are very underwelming and has been done better in other game especially the witcher 3 cut content, missing features, horrible ai, false advertisement, a horde of bugs and the list goes on... i might give it a try again in a year or two, but i honestly dont think this game can be saved sadly...."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-16,"playing on a high end pc this game is a blast and so incredibly beautiful. its almost like a game from the future with an incredibly dense atmosphere. you can get lost walking around in the city just taking everything in. on my system ryzen 3900x, rtx 3080, 64gb ram it ran very well with some minor glitches at times. looking forward to updates, patches and additional content."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-16,"infelizmente  um jogo que foi lanado antes da hora, est repleto de bugs e erros que prejudicam a gameplay e sua imerso. contudo sua historia  interresante e envolvente nada mais....  realmente lamentavel.........."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-16,"for all fans of cyberpunk genre its 1010 story, fighting, a lot of philosophy, great game!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-15,"okay this game made me to write a 2nd review and i've to admit i like it. first time i write this i said i'm very disappointed and gave 410. i was expecting a totally different game  an open world similar to gta. but cyberpunk is different  the main ambition is the story here going hand in hand with hacking your enemies  and those two things i like the most. i shot just a couple of times and every time i've opportunity i breach into cameras, enemies and hack them to death  that's really cool. also the character perks are pretty impressive. to conclude i like the atmosphere, hacking and the plot."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-15,"!    ,        .     ,  ,      .         !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-15,"i'll cut to the chase, this game is a mess. i understand the whole covid thing and that the upper management is the core of this bs but how can a game be in this much of a mess. characters tposing randomly and cars just randomly flip, this game's trash. the graphics and physics are no better than other games on the market such as gta and hzd. the world feels detached and empty at times with me losing the gist of the story quite early on in the game. this game reminds me of da inquisition but in a cyberpunk genre. the npc is so monotone and the sidemissions bloat the story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-14,ive played the game throughout and i can confidently give it a 110. ive wasted my money on it. terrible story and mechanics. theyve over hyped this game that should have been a beta release. maybe it is open world but you cant enter any buildings or interact with any npcs. do not buy.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-14,"beautiful visuals, fun combat, great music and an amazing story. everything else isn't as good imo but i loved this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-14,"cada actualizacin que sacan hace que aparezcan mas bugs, creo que debera ser alrevez. 510 esperaba mas de este juego, que lamentable"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-14,not bad game so moooooore bugs please fix fixbugsindcyberpunk2077 take care and play cyberpunk2077
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-14,"this game had a huge expectation. some delays made yus think that they fixed all bugs and glitches. but the final product still has the bugs and glitches. except from that kind of issues, i really liked to play with v. in many missions i felt the same way as v. game has a good feeling impact. for the main story i didn't like the end of game, i was still waiting what will come in the next scene but the game ended up there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-12,"originally, i gave this game a 6, and was quite early on in storywise. what changed is that, as i played, the world slowly began to open up, and there was a lot more story content and world building that happened in that time. i think the greatest flaw of this game is that, if you just cut right to the side content, there won't be much there for you initially, which will turn off a lot of people, but as you get into act ii and beyond, more comes into play. the game hides too much at the beginning, giving you the wrong impression of the game, an otherwise amazing game it suffers because of it's linearity. i love the characters, the story, takamura and panam being my favorites, as well as johnny silverhand, who slowly becomes a loveable character, despite being an  to you at first. this game is a solid rpg, even if it forks you into similar or even the same events, regardless of choices you make, but what is there is quite substantial. it's very hard to nail what makes a game an rpg, and despite this game's linearity, the choices you make still feel like they matter. there are a lot of negative things i have to say about this game as well. cut content, no train, lacking character customization, bugs, voice gender lock, no theythem option at the very least, and while there are relationship and sexual encounters, they're few and far between, and some characters that were ripe for romance and sexual encounters say like takamura are completely unavailable, despite the potential being there. most of the game's buildings aren't really able to be explored. the game has issues with steady framerates even on the beefiest of pcs, let a lone mid range ones. and i see that it's a nightmare on console. all these things do take away from an otherwise great action game with rpg elements, but do not completely destroy the experience. now coming back to revise this review once more, i have to speak on the insane lack of endgame content. once you've finished your gigs and police scanner missions, the game is absolutely empty. all those dynamic encounters that they were talking about, and interactivity, just flat out wasn't there. the city becomes an empty shell of what could have been. this was an aspect that they really skimped out on, and i'd really expect actual endgame content from an open world sandbox rpg type game. honestly disappointed, and all this game's negatives really do make this game a forgettable experience in the long run. the game is a fun time while it lasts, then you'll forget it. 710"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-12,"i can see where they are going with the game, but the world just doesn't  me in the same way witcher 3 did or red dead 2. the glitches randomly happening also definitely takes away from it. shame this is the state of the game today."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-11,"i've never played a more underdeveloped game before and i've been playing for 15 years. great expectations and excitement before the game's release, and now a few months after the game is still unplayable even on powerful computer. time wasted trying to fix the game and finding ways to make the game just work should be spent playing something else. a total disappointment for the cd project red"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-11,"this game is very powerful, you'll need a godlike pc or an xbox to run it smoothly that aside, it's super original and outstanding, what a master piece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-11,"10 vast majority of you are very unrealistic, you need to perceive and appreciate a highly innovative game when you have it in front of your eyes, it's completely different from the rest of games in the market. deserves a 9 at least, just because of that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-10,"just a overrated game. so basic, much technology, few inovation. i really don't appreciate this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-10,"cyberpunk 2077 it's about the story. as an rpg it's never met expectations. but i think, most who we can blame is a society  who can't wait patiently. this game could be released later for a year or even two. this game could be fixed in a few months if people just wait. i've started playing when patch 1.12 was introduced, and i have a few bugs, yes, there are some bugs. but the game could be finished in 202122 the same as it is shown for us. lack of patience kills it. people are forcing things to be released as it is, just to get the unfinished crap. of course, you will be angry. when your pizza is raw, but pizza can't be done with so many ingredients in it as fast as usual pizza! you wanted skyrim in farcry, but you got what you deserve."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-09,"can't understand all those naysayers. i played on pc 130 hours playtime, sure there were some little bugs like clipping errors or funny stacked cars but nothing gamebreaking. i love the main story and the endings and all of that cyberpunk flair. finally a game with smart guns, missed this since avp 2. probably cdpr should have better managed expectations, this game was never intended to be a gta."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-09,"el juego es aceptable con sus bugs pero se excede en mostrar mensajes subliminales y mensajes explcitos con simbolismo satnico, sexual, masoniluminati y un lenguaje vulgar. no me interesa este tipo de juegos donde quieren lavarnos el cerebro con este tipo ideas."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-09,meh... it's kinda good maybe future dlcs will fix issues overall i think it should come out in 2023 and be more polished

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-08,"the optimization is surprisingly good on the rx 570 at an average of 50 fps. there is nothing more good here. the plot is short, there are no rpgs, there are several impalnts, in deus ex there are even more. there are a lot of lies from the developers, such people should be punished."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-08,"i got this after the ps4 version which was my worse gaming experience in years so bad i quit and got a return. this game isn't what i wanted coming from the ps4 experience i thought the pc would be skys ahead everyone was saying get it on pc it runs so well it's so polished. it's not. it has so much missing that was suppose to be there from promotions, i followed the updates and all the studio people saying what this was going to be an ambitious open world with revolutionary game play. ready when it's ready and other lines. i expected it to be ready and the game to be something like kotor in world building and design. i have got a refund for ps4 and uninstalled the pc game, cdpr needed another 3 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-07,"cyberdecepcin. he jugado cyberpunk practicamente desde el da de su lanzamiento v 1.02 y no encontr ningn glitch o fallo que me impidiera completar alguna misin o que fuera realmente molesto. adems de que lo puede jugar de manera fluida a 1080p en calidad media en un porttil msi de 2017 con una gtx 1050 de 2gb. por lo que mi decepcin no es por el acabado tcnico muchsimo mejor, por cierto, ahora que van por el parche 1.12 sino por el juego en s. no voy a ser como esos idiotas que esperaban un mundo real con millones de personas cada una con 100 lneas de dilogo y donde toda una ciudad fuera interactiva pero si que esperaba mucho ms en general. mi crtica no va dirigida a lo que debera haber incluido el juego o a lo que se debera poder hacer. me da igual que un arcade no se pueda jugar o que el vendedor de perritos calientes sea de pega. el problema viene con lo que el juego ofrece de por si y eso es un problema muy grave porque denota falta de ganas e ilusin por parte de los desarrolladores. por poner algunos ejemplos, el juego dispone de muchsimos vehculos y algunos son realmente caros pero no necesitan un vehculo para nada en cyberpunk y si lo necesitas te lo regalan. lo difcil en un juego es crear 100 armas nicas y que cada jugador elija la suya y que algunas sean ms difciles que otras de conseguir, cyberpunk opta por la opcin cutre de los hackslash de darte el mismo objeto infinitas veces pero actualizando su rareza o sus caractersticas secundarias pero an as no vale para nada pues yo termin el juego de principio a fin en la mxima dificultad con la primera katana que consegu, decepcionante, e igual sucede con las armaduras. los que sepan realmente que es cyberpunk saben que una mecnica del juego era los cool que eres y la ropa que llevabas tena un enorme impacto social, en este juego sin embargo debes conformarte con ponerte el atuendo ms feo que haya slo porque sus stats son las mejores, penoso. la interaccin con el mundo no es pobre sino nefasta, te acercas a alguien que est llorando y su lnea de dilogo es que buen da hace wtf, la polica se teletransporta a tus espaldas de manera automtica si la las pero con correr 100 metros en lnea recta los pierdes. disparas al aire y la gente en vez de huir se queda en cuclillas quieta en el suelo diciendo sandeces sin sentido... en fin, insultante. lo nico salvable de este juego es disfrutar de la pelcula, ver a keanu reeves hacer de rockero malote, tener alguna aventura sexual y tratar de olvidarse de todas las cosas malas que tiene el juego mientras intentas disfrutar de los poquito que se puede salvar. porque no es un mundo abierto ni de broma porque adems de estar lleno de muros invisibles de nivel con enemigos esponja con cantidades absurdas de vida, la exploracin no es nada gratificante debido al chapucero sistema de loot del juego, para que explorar si tengo una katana y 200 granadas desde el minuto 1? el rbol de habilidades y las posibilidades de creacin de diferentes personajes es insultante y simplona si lo comparamos con cuberpunk original pues han obviado reglas tan bsicas del gnero como que meterse implantes te hace perder carisma y humanidad adems de poder generar problemas de salud. en este juego esa opcin de superpoderes vs humanidad sencillamente no existe, mtete implantes cibernticos que ni a tu cuerpo, ni a tu cerebro ni a la sociedad le importa un carajo. un juego que si proviniera de un estudio pequeo y sin recursos podra ser perdonado y animado a mejorarse pero siendo quienes son los desarrolladores estamos ante un caso claro de hype, falsas espectativas, gameplays y trailers engaosos y un resultado final muy mediocre y decadente. por ello merece un castigo y una nota estricta y negativa."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-07,"decent game despite all the flaming and criticism from everyone. yes, there are some bugs and minuses but overall the game was nice. the world is very interesting and well developed full of beautiful places. the action is great and the atmosphere is awesome. yea at some point the game is getting too easy and there are some glitches and some useless things. but i think people look with a negative eye to this game because it was too hyped and it didn't meet their expectations. the idea was good the execution wasn't perfect but can't say it was bad either."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-07,"why is this trash still on main page? it failed months ago, there's zero reason to promote it anymore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-07,"one of the best written stories in videogames could be a really, really good scifi novel. deep plot and lore, very interesting characters and meaningful moments and sidequest. i've played with patch 1.1 and i've only experienced minor bugs that wasn't nothing important. and yes, the combat  stealth system could be better, but it's not awful. so, i totally recommend this game, it's one of the top 10 without a doubt."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-06,"more interested in hyping up the game than to actually finishing it. game is almost unplayable on machines where witcher 3 looks and runs gorgeously. they tried everything in their power to hide the truth about the game from the actual games by things like not letting reviewers review the game on consoles, not letting them use their own footage of the game just their preproduced marketing material! absolutely disgusting. they now bowed down to the chinese dictatorship banning devotion of their store for a joke that would be perfectly fine in poland and represent the values of society that at least still enjoys some freedoms. absolutely disgusting move! do not fall for them, they have become corrupt now. not any different from ea, bethesda or blizzard who also censored for the chinese dictatorship"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-06,"cyberpunk 2077 is a action roleplaying game. cyberpunk's reception and probably also its quality was seriously affected by the prerelease events and expectations so lets start with that. the witcher 3 was the game that put cd project red on the throne of video game development. the game was fantastic and is widely considered to be one of the best games of all time, if not the very best. after witcher 3, the developers announced that they will depart from the witcher world and focus their attention on this new big project, cyberpunk 2077. because of the spotless record of the cd project red, many gamers were understandably expecting a masterpiece to rival or even exceed the witcher 3. those expectations were only strengthened by the overall situation in the gaming world, where titans of the industry, such as bioware, blizzard and bethesda were quickly falling from grace and into the abyss. the wait was long and the draught was almost unbearable. all that caused the expectations of cybepunk 2077 to skyrocket to such heights, that it became clear, that no matter how good the game actually would be, it could never actually meet them. that on its own is a recipe for disaster. plus allegations of so called crunch were voiced against the company. in my opinion, this whole business was a result of our society being so spoiled and weak, that it considers hard work as something reprehensible. the times we live in. anyway, the game was finally released in december 2020 and from the first minutes, it became very apparent that something is really wrong. the game was, and still is today, full of bugs, ranging from minor visual glitches, lighting etc. to major game breaking save file size limit, unable to complete certain missions etc.. that was a huge letdown and given its release date, it became clear that someone forced this unpolished and maybe even unfinished game to be released in the holiday season. this decision cannot be justified from any perspective, because even the extra money they made, were far outweighed by the unprecedented number of refunds. but the greatest loss for the company is the loss of reputation, something that will cost them very dearly in the years to come. pity. now the actual game is really interesting, the design of the night city is just amazing. even in witcher 3, cdpr proved that they can design a beautiful and functional city novigrad and in cyberpunk 2077, this gets even enhanced and becomes one of the coolest aspects of the game. regarding graphics, the game can look very pretty, but at a very steep performance cost unlike witcher 3, which was also beautiful and yet lowspec pc friendly. the story is great, but kinda short and it becomes, specially towards the end, strangely predictable and also struggles to stay clear of certain storytelling cliches. it can also get a bit confusing, if you are not a cyberpunk fan. i really like certain characters, of course johnny is the best, great work by keanu reeves, the weird coexistence with v is done very well. romance is kinda scarce, theoretically you have four options, but really you only have one, so that could definitely be improved. because you are moving through a big city, you will spend a lot of time in your car. driving feels really arcade and is riddled with a number of bugs and oversights. the smallest and yet possibly the most annoying of them is the ridiculously zoomed in minimap, which causes you to miss a lot of turns or use a regular map which is also not very good every ten seconds or so. there is also a lot of randomly appearing and disappearing traffic. there is a decent number of cars you can drive and own, most of them are really slow and sluggish definitely for a year 2077, for example late in the main story you will get a very cool looking porsche 930, which will however only do about 160 kmh, despite the fact that the real car had a maximum speed of 260 kmh way back in 1975. specially the transmissions are very unrealistic and acting weird. the music is pretty good, not my thing really, but decent. the difficulty of the game is just another thing that is not optimized well. on harder difficulties, the first hours are really hard and on the contrary the second half of the game feels really easy regardless of talent or equipment choices. this game contains no microtransactions and little sjw, although it seems to me that, despite the prerelease trans poster hysteria, the game is trying to stay from controversy. pardon me for constantly comparing this game to its cdpr predecessor, but my overall feeling is that what once came easy with witcher 3, is now toiled for in cyberpunk 2077. even if they fix all the bugs and oversights, this game will still not be as good as the witcher games of course, that is just my opinion. but despite all that, cyberpunk 2077 has a lot of very good moments and with a lot of polish and some strong dlcs it can absolutely become a great game. final verdict 68"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-06,"when comparing what we got to what we were promised this game is a straight up lie. in any other industry there would be outrage and lawsuits like crazy. the bugs overshadows how lackluster the game is. unless all you want to do in an open world rpg is to go from quest to quest in a linear fashion, this will be disappointing. the rpg elements are a joke, the ai are non existant. the only redeeming factors are the amazing visuals and how night city looks, a great ost, and the compelling characters. this game needed 2 more years in the oven at least. this is only the ground work for what could've been an amazing game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-02,great rpg game with some little problem which are not seen updates have improved game optimization
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-02,game is full of bugs and many of the features talked about in marketing are not present. do not buy this game as it is swindling money out of you by over promising hard and under delivering even harder. i have put in about 50 hours into the game and maybe enjoyed 3 out of them. you have to constantly save and load the game to get around the bugs. sometimes quests wont progress and even their hotfixes introduced more game breaking bugs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-01,everyone should watch some gameplay before they buy this game and not because of the glitches. the main character is a bag and they way he delivers almost every line is cringe worthy. if you can get past that the game has a ton of sub par elements to enjoy.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-01,"everyone rating this game a negative review just has a stick up their ass because for some reason we have all forgotten that bugs are a normal thing. yes this game has its bugs but those are getting patched with a new patch coming out today and more on the way. you can say the game is overhyped because it was and you can say its generic because it can be at times but you cant review bomb a game for being buggy after a few days from launch. this would have been a completely different story if covid was never a thing. im sure it was a lot harder to get things done and its not like they are just going to leave the game in its current state. im giving it a 10, not because its a 10, but because people are on here giving a 0 because it cant run on 7 year old hardware a day after launch. what did you expect a next generation game to run like on last gen hardware. patch was just released today to fix textures on ps4 and xbox one. you can argue all you want that the game should have been delayed again but if it was everyone would have been pissed about that. the new thing that everyone likes to do is hate on games and i dont get it. this game is a blast even with the bugs and id recommended buying it. if you are skeptical, wait a little for patches but definitely dont completely ignore it like these guys giving it 0s are saying. edit i take some of what i said back and i'm bumping my score to a 7. i did enjoy my time with the game on pc where is was not as buggy but it was not the game we were promised."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-01,"cyberpunk was a fun and ambitious game but with some flaws. the story was interesting if not a bit short for the main quest. however it is devoid of humour. a character that was providing joy and fun quickly disappear into the story. most of the side quests are very repetitive, only a few has some real lines. the graphics are nice but there is a lot a small glitches. yes, the scope and size of the city is amazing but you have to wonder if that wasn't too big of a chunk for cd project. the interface is a the real problem in the game. it's way too complex, not very intuitive and has a long learning curve. it feels like little chunks who were fused together without any real global vision. riding bikes are way more fun then cars, because the cars feels like riding bikes. the fast travel is a real time saver but it's also fun to ride and discover the city. there is a lot of loots. you can modify and upgrades weapons, armours. you can craft just about anything but it's easier to upgrade then crafting from nothing. the level system is well done but the interface cut the pleasure of it. the music is the very best. the in car tunes or main soundtrack are great. the presence of keanu is a good touch. the voices and sounds fits perfectly. however, a lot of npc have generic one liners. you can talk to everybody but it's a useless option. the combat is fps style and do offer stealth. it works well enough and each weapons has some limitations of their own. i completed the game with all the yellow icons in 62 hours. the ending was good and was kind of open. i give the game 78. i know the game isn't perfect but i had fun exploring that city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-01,"update 5 for the hilariously terrible astroturfing in forums, social media and of course on this very site. together with the overall pr response and the whole story leading up to this point cyberpunk might have at least succeded at pointing out that evil corporations can wear tshirts while desperately trying to grow their remaining hair out.  10 because every game could be a 10 tldr while telling a way better story, cyberpunk 2077 unfortunately put gta 4's vehicles in the greatest city i've seen in a video game while having fallout 76's ai and quality management  0.5 disappointing character creation with terrible ui  2 sadistic control scheme for mouse and keyboard with gamebreaking doublebindings that can't be changed. 0.5 the game uses far too much resources for what it actually does, it's not just bad optimization  1 civilian npcs are terrible, with glitching audio, no facial animations, and cloned throughout the city, mostly smoking and eating invisible things while making rocks look smart. whatever immersion you might experience, they will kill it.  0.5 nonscaling fonts in front of very punky glitchy backgrounds make reading a hassle, which given the amount of interesting text put in the game is a shame 2 for an otherwise impressive, sometimes breathtaking city, especially while you are outside and don't do anything.  0.5 vehicles steer like bricks on ice. traffic ai is borderline embarrassing. you can live without them, but that's no excuse.  0 if you expected to do anything but the missions in this fantastic city, forget about it. side activities are mostly shopping in copypasted stores and getting insulted by everyone including sex workers and bar personal. it's wasted potential, not an actual flaw  1 for glitches in vital gameplay mechanics, starting with the often confused gps, nonresponsive buttons, nonresponsive controls, nonresponsive enemy ai 0.5 trying to hide the zombielevel incompetence of the ai with cheating and spamming 0.5 inventory, journal and character management screens are multileveled, obtuse things that hide more information than they give you.  0 too much loot, making crafting and shopping useless mechanics, but that's just more wasted potential 0 can't say i was impressed by story, lore, characters and even the praised side missions, but unlike the rest they do the job. for everything i liked there were just too many campy, corny moments, and for everything that surprised me, there was a ton of edgy, pretentious stuff that wanted so desperately to be cool that it made me feel old."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-03-01,"the 8 that im giving this game is too much but im being generous here. for me the game didnt have many bugs except minor ones and a few gamebreaking ones but i didnt play more than the campaign and 10 hours of sidemissions so i can understand why. the game has a lack of many things which is a shame since it was i will say indeed really enjoyable. the guns could be really intresting but they were really simple the smart weapons and legendeary guns were not really different from the normal guns. the story was good but short and i usually dont have problems with short campaigns but this melt like it should belonger. characters voice acting and music is probably the best thing in the game. the worst things in the game except glitches are hacking since its weak and you probably will never use it or need it, combat wich its ok since the game is mostly gunfights, the ai for many reassons actually and of course the stealth. this game is not stealth and could never be detection happens like enemies are superhumans and you move like you  yourself  you cant even take cover or switch cover. the game has so many bad things but succeds to be entertaining, that only shows that the game had big potention but was rushed. nothing new in this review probably things that youve heard before."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-28,"this is the first game i preordered in the last five years, because i legitimately expected cdpr to delivery a finished product. my problem is the lies from cdpr, they annoy me, i feel betrayed and were the reason i asked for a refund. the game lacks 3rd person camera because they ran out of time to animate cutscenes, not for immersion a lie they told. this is the same reason the lifepaths were 15 minutes long. the story shorter than the witcher 3. the story suffers from certain exposition issues and 98 of dialogue choices according to the official game guide lead to the same outcome. pacificia district is 75 inaccessible and looks unfinished from angles which they forgot to cover up. sexuality is handled in an immature way that breaks immersion with all the cringe billboards and ads across night city for no understandable reason. my problem isn't the bugs, its that deep down, its a hollow game and cdpr wont add content to the main story, they wont make the lifepaths any longer, they cant pull a no man's sky without adding content to the existing game. this is what hello games did, along with numerous free dlc's for almost 3 years. gamers hounded a reviewer for giving this a 710. there were 800 word dissertations about why she was clearly not the target audience and deserves to be fired. should've put that effort into your college admission essay. the review embargo was unacceptable and makes it obvious that cdpr knew about the problems and chose to hide rather than be honest about the state of this game. beyond the neon aesthetics and gameplay elements. there is not much cyberpunk about this game's narrative. it seriously misses the punk aspect of cyberpunk. it fails to engage with any of the values of the genre. except there is something a metacommentary about how cyberpunk genre is undead today because corporations wanted to cash in."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-26,"cdpr, you still didn't understand anything. your studio was almost the only one that people trusted unconditionally. you behaved like a typical aaa company handing out keys to corrupt journalists, gaining 91 points, hiding console versions from people. to say that this is a scam is to say nothing. but the main problem is that cyberpunk 2077 turned out to be just a good game, which is unacceptable for a project with such an advertising campaign."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-26,"a gem i miss playing for the first time, truly. you may hear that people's experience in cyberpunk 2077 has been hindered by the implications of its buggy release even with over eightyears in development, but completing it after 40 hours doing side missions and whatnot for the first time, i was blown away. through my years of playing storydriven video games, i have never cried to a finale until now. in fact, when i first opened cyberpunk 2077, doubts were circling in my mind about the bugs and optimisation issues, however, on medium settings, it is somewhat playable on an rtx 2060 super and the bugs were infrequent. driving through night city, or looking at it from a distance is a sight to see. everything from the worldbuilding to its highly developed charactersstory was breathtaking you totally didn't see that reference coming! not to mention, i think it was breath of fresh air to play an rpg that was relatively short, as it allows for greater replayability in my opinion, and that stands true because i am onto my third character. additionally, the messaging system is a cool side feature that forms a connection between the player and character more. the voice acting was phenomenal, and they definitely helped bring the characters to life. the romance side of things is... acceptable, to say the least. i was a little disappointed at the lack of screen time between v and the partner of your choice with only one intimate mission. the combat is the most fun i have had in an rpg before. augmentations were cool to experiment with and the firstperson animations feel satisfying that malorian arms 3516 animation, though. stealth, along with hacking security, felt entirely optional but definitely an interesting way to play through the missions. although cyberpunk 2077 isn't labelled as an rpg title, it still plays like one, however, not the most advanced i have seen where are the choices that actually have consequences! cars handle well and are realistically heavier than some other notable games like grand theft auto v. admittedly, they are buggy, and bikes have questionable physics that don't work very well. cyberpunk 2077 also has other neat minor features like photo mode that allows you to pause the game and interact with the environment or adding postprocessing effectsfilters to take the perfect screenshot outside the perspective of v, something i would like to see in more games. i have been spending a lot of time praising this game, except understand there are many downsides as well. some i felt during the gameplay was how useless crafting felt since i never really had to do it that much. for qualityoflife features, too much, unfortunately. no way to change the appearance of your physical attributes and clothing, really cdpr? some of these were actually in their previous popular title, the witcher 3 wild hunt, so i don't understand? from a technical standpoint, you can tell the game was made at the last minute, like how it crashes upon minimising, fps drops, poorly coded ai and duplication or disappearance of items during cutscenes. also, side missions ceasing to continue? come on, you're better than that. lastly, the score is incredible one of the best i have ever heard. whether you dislike cyberpunk 2077 or not, it is difficult to say otherwise. edit after months of contemplating, my view of the game has negatively changed, therefore the score of this review will drop from an eight to a seven. learning about the false promises that cd projekt red said they would deliver has certainly made me upset with their decisions. the 2018 gameplay trailer showed a completely different game and although they labelled it as work in progress, it is blatant the trailer was produced in such a sleazy way that made the company hope they could be redeemed from the bad press. what a shame it didn't work. ultimately, it was a method of deception to make us believe the gameplay shown could be improved. instead, what we actually got was a watereddown version. cyberpunk 2077 is, by all means, a good game if you overlook the nasty marketing and fundamental problemsbugs. however, i will not accept the dirty corporate implementations in advertising a game that we thought was in good hands. apparently, no aaa gaming company can deliver the product we paid for, huh? and as what johnny silverhand would say  the corps."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-25,"i won the main story line with plenty of other quests to discover and enjoy. the beauty of the game is the artwork, so many corners, alleys and locations to explore. the guy who coincidentally looks like keanu reeves was a waste of time he missed his bus 2025 and got stuck in night city. any scifi fan will notice inspirations from many 1980's and 1990's films, you'll pick up on the styles as you play. big negative, too much dialog and too much text dragged down the pacing of the game. i plan in time to explore the remaining nooks and enemies just to see the whole map. i explored very little of the map to get the completion. i can't imagine what could still remain. i found various art pieces air born or stuck together, in my experience the other 99 of the settings was good enough for me. i couldn't complain."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-25,it's not thaat bad it's just not a triple a title. nope in everything except looks compared to the witcher 3 otherwise expect bland rpg quest lines ''that just work'' akin to fallout. it just quickly becomes repetitive and thats its greatest fallback.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-24,"this game is the best example that paid rewievers are writing what they are paid for. you should never belive them and never buy a game before the release day. cyberpunk 2077 is not finished.i repeat it is not finished! there are a lots of bugs even after hotfix 1.06. all promises appear to be lies. maybe cyberpunk 2077 will be quite playable after 12 years. now it is a waste of your money. it is worth max 10 eur. it is a shame as i can see a lot of work put in this game by graphics, sound, music and other specialists. but even when you look at this game as interactive movie it is not fun because of bugs destroying a mood. there is a reason why i do not describe more details. it is simply pointless to describe not finished product. you cannot say that car has been broken and is not going forward if a manufacturer did not added an engine to it. so despite describing all problems in a game we can just say it is not finished. when it will be finished we can describe good and bad points of cyberpunk 2077."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-23,"i played this game on my ps4 and no, it had no problems playing it. the game did crash one single time, i had one bug that i had to fix which resulted in having to fail in another mission that i didn't care about and besides that there were a few little loading issues because the game of course was a bit to much for my console. but overall, i absolutely loved this. the emotions carried by the story and soundtrack are fantastic, the whole story in connection with the city seemed fantastic and original to me. it's such a pity that this game was unfinished and bugged, it's the only reason i don't give it a 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-23,"alright, so this is a tough one for me. why, you ask? because i actually had tons of fun playing it. and no, not just because witcher 3, made by the same developer, is my favorite game, no hell no. i enjoyed it because its quite fun to play, its fun to drive around the city on my bike or car or whatever, listening to the fire songs on the radio. in  pretty fun, and you can easily sink your teeth into it. now, here's where things go downhill...i know i rated an 8, but i feel like pointing out cyberpunk's faults and flaws, cause man believe me it has plenty. first, bugs, of course, but tbh, these are fixable. even witcher 3 was poorly optimized and was ridden with bugs at launch, so this is not a huge issue for me, a buggy launch. so lets go on now... lack of, barber  this was a bummer. i absolutely loved seeing my geralt with different hairstyles and beards that i like, and that factor was missing from cyberpunk. not even tattoos, although i can excuse tattoos, but barber shops should've been there.  there are choices, but it is all an illusion. i remember, that in e3 or something cdpr had said that if we do not put the body down in the sandra dorsett mission ncpd will react, and how do they react? they just push you backwards and force you to drop the body anyways. i was expecting they'd shoot you or arrest you or something, but no.  is one of the places where cyberpunk fails. there's no police ai, they just pop up everywhere you are. npc ai is also not great enough, no person reacts to you, well majorly. as someone with quite a bit of knowledge of the mike pondsmith's cyberpunk universe, every night city resident, rich or poor, should carry a weapon to protect themselves against the brutal nightmares of night city. but nope, only gangs and police have weapons. cars don't drive around you either. driving is not good enough, its not smooth and your car has the high tendency to flip over on its head. maybe some positives, as well the character of v is quite wellwritten. not as much as our favorite witcher, but good enough to get a pass. story is where the game outshines every other game. story is the best i have ever seen in a videogame, fullytense and amazing. overall, you might think why i didn't give a negative  reason i still support cdpr. i believe that they are at a point of their existence where they can learn from their mistakes and forever be the 'good guy', or be overcome by greed for money and lack of dedication and be clubbed under the same category as ea, bioware, etc. also the fact that this is their first step into cyberpunk universe, and i remember how witcher 1 and 2 also were similarly ruined by ambition, then came witcher 3. so there's still hope. i won't say its a mustbuy, but its a good game definitely. if you can manage to bear through it, it'll give you fun. maybe you won't love it, but you'll like it. won't...outright recommend you, but if you're like, bored and looking for a small new game to play, get cyberpunk and play it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-23,"despite some of the obvious issues, this game still gave me the best experience i've ever had from a videogame. it really felt like i lived a life there, in 2077. the visuals, the music, the stories and loveable characters made the game insanely immersive. i'll definitely remember these magical quiet dialogue scenes for the whole life."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-22,"one of the best games i ever played  i have over 7000 games on steam  all people that are trashing this amazing piece of art were either playing on very bad pc or never played it. cd projekt made some bad choices like delivering unpolished game on consoles but it was exactly the same with all of their games like witcher, witcher 2 and witcher 3. i would like to mention that witcher 3 on premiere was unplayable on base ps4, fps were dropping to 78 when you used igni in dungeons or inside buildings. overall, after spending more than 300h in night city i can say without a doubt  this is one of the best games ever made, sure its not finished but after all patches and fixes it will be best game ever made"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-21,"contrary to cdpr trying to say the game's only problems are with base consoles, i would argue that this game's biggest problems go well beyond bugs, crashes, and performance. in almost every respect, this game is a halfbaked, unpolished mess with only some hints at what could have been a great game. it redeems itself somewhat by certain elements, but it's hard not to feel ripped off, even on pc. my experience with cyberpunk has been a wakeup call to 1 never preorder games ever again, 2 never purchase a cdpr game again, unless several years have passed, it has been thoroughlyvetted, and is at a bargain bin price, and 3 be extremely skeptical of online review sites unbelievable that so many reviewers immediately jumped to give this mess 9s and 10s. with bugs around every corner, clearly unfinished or cut content, mediocre shooter mechanics, a lifeless open world, and so on, it is hard to even know how to begin reviewing this game. i think what best encapsulates the problems with cyberpunk is the example of witnessing an npc playing guitar on the streets for the first time. it was incredible to see the level of detail they are playing a song that corresponds to their individual finger movements and correct guitar chords. however, five minutes later you could accidentally run over an npc due to the horrible driving mechanics, triggering a police chase, which consists of police drones just appearing out of thin air drive down a corner and suddenly you are no longer wanted. that's it. you also see how cars aren't even programmed to move around you or notice that if you look at cars in the distance they appear as weird jpeg cutouts. the list goes on and on with some of the most primitive elements of game design either not functioning or wholly absent. it is as if the developers spent time on nextgen features like npcs playing accurate guitar chords but somehow left out so many simple features. this extends to lifeless npcs, a horrible user interface, boring and shallow rpg mechanics, short main story, pointless origin choices, and so on. the game does have some strengths buried in there, and i would say that is with the core main storyline, character design, voiceacting, soundtrack, and potentially graphics. i say potentially because the game looks great only on highend hardware. any midrange pc even seems to end up looking blurry and grainy. the scripted cutscenes and certain interiors look fantastic though and the visual atmosphere is overall really good. the core storyline with johnny silverhand was pretty good and kept me emotionally invested however, it is nothing revolutionary. it relies on pretty much every previously made cyberpunk trope. i love the genre, so this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just not very original. the voiceacting and characters were overall excellent, especially female v, johnny silverhand keanu, and jackie welles. i also really liked the soundtrack with a few standout tracks that i continue to listen to even after finishing the game. these elements were enough to keep me playing through to the end, but definitely don't save the game from ultimately being an overhyped, mediocre mess for the most part."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-21,"well, cyberpunk 2077, one of the most controversial games ever, is it really as bad as people say? i had to play it myself to find out the truth so here is my review according to my about 20hrs playtime there was a lot of hype around the game and the devs lied about a lot of the features of the game which turned out to be lies but the game isn't as bad as people say. the biggest or maybe only advantage of cp2077 is it's story and narrative, while your choices don't impact the story as much as i expected, it's story has been really exciting from start until now the characters are also good. when you play cp2077 you feel you are experiencing an incomplete mess which could be a masterpiece if more time was spent working on it, the game lacks necessary details that you expect from an open world game, the npc and enemy ai is terrible, the vehicle handling is aweful, animations aren't natural and you will see a lot of bugs, including game breaking ones. on the other hand there are many weopons and upgrades and various missions that you can enjoy the main missions are good bugs aside but most of the side quest are boring imo. while nightcity is designed very well and the game's graphics are nice especially lighting the game's world feels empty and lifeless. the game isn't optimized even on pc, i had to lower the resolution to 90 and lock the fps to 30 while i can play other games with better graphic settings. overally i think cyberpunk 2077 worths playing, especially if you have a descent pc, you will surely enjoy it's beautiful graphics and exciting story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-21,"the game was able to tighten and interest me. she has a lot of problems with mechanics and bugs. but the bugs are fixable and the plot, the music and even the masher are just great. if you like an interesting plot and a super otmasphere. you must take this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-21,"the game is not what devs wanted to present us at the beginning, so yes, if you're still living in 2015 and expect the game to be what you had been promised then, then it will disappoint you. a lot has been cut out, yet the initial intentions were in fact gigantic and, i guess, the main reason i admire the game so much is that i've never believed they could achieve that in the first place, and they still delivered a lot. and i thought that all the chipstuff would be too complicated and tedious and won't work, and yet, cdpr delivered, and it just works sort of. it's still somewhat complicated, but totally playable. and it is still a great game. unpolished  yes and yet for pc it was pretty much satisfactory from the day one  much better then tes and later battlefield series on their release. but the game is great, and, what matters the most, it is the new deus ex for the new generation of gamers. in general, gameplay outmatches or at least smoothly accommodates everything that has been done in this direction, and cdpr have actually delivered the true new game of immersive sim genre. the ui is still somewhat flawed tho. for example, they really had to dig more into gta's map. but that's not something you cannot get used to. except for turns. damn turns. they really should zoom out the map or angle it. a lot of people complain that the game is not optimized properly. yet they forget that for hl2 pcs from 2000 were too old, for oblivion pcs from 2002 were too old, and for cyberpunk it's only 20132014. 7 years old pcs can run cyberpunk smoothly on low settings tho, instead of 24 years old, as it was for games that were coming out in early 00's. and activision games? cod warzone makes my pc burn on low settings, while i play cyberpunk smoothly on high settings, while it's cyberpunk what is actually the nextgen. and, i guess, the problem is that there were no games since the start of 2017. no, really. rdr2, sw jedy fallen order, farcry 5 and new dawn,.. control? that's all, except for factorystamped cod and assassins. people just got loosen up by indie games and forgot that serious major new games require serious hardware. so, for short  and upgrade your pc. you only need like 2015's hardware with 16gb ram and a videocard that has 6 gb vram to run cyberpunk absolutely smoothly, and you can get it for roughly 500 or 1k, if you'd like to buy all new parts, which is exactly the cost of a new pc in early 00's, heh. yet, i must say, that absolutely stupid people mob ai makes the game quite... disbalanced. it's like you live in a braindead city. or in a simulation. and i do hope that cdpr would change that with some of their patches. so, for me, with all the bugs and stupid ai and scripted scenes, it's solid 810. probably it could've been 6, but i'm not just a regular pewpewgamer and i see the technical side of the game, thus i see the enormous effort. and considering all the flame on the internet, and here in reviews, i think that my duty is to balance the score with a ten."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-21,"speaking for myself... i love this game. like, really, really love. everyone else? well, theres only one of me... so thats the only opinion i find relevant when adding your rating. 10"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-21,"very nice game, but so many bugs and crush. i very love this game70 hours played, but so many crushed i disliked"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-20,"cyberpunk is a game that has a great potential but was released very early, although i played a game on the pc, optimization problems did not leave me, i encountered 12 bugs that prevent gameplay in the game, other bugs i did not care much"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-20,"i cant even call it a videogame because it's not! this is a result of production chaos and incompetence of key people in the studio, especially game designers as a consequence cyberpunk is a soulless set of different and ambitious ideas, but in the head of a child who unfortunately does not know how to implement it into reality, like a medical university applicant who draws in his head ambuscades about surgery and medicine based on the tv series scrubs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-19,"disappointment wrapped in marketing hype. if you are on the fence about this game. save yourself the trouble. this does not meet the story, choices, or presentation expected from the developer of w3. the graphics was the only positive."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-19,"whilst this game does have some serious issues, i have been fortunate enough to not be plagued my many of these in the time that i have spent playing this game. that is not to say that there aren't any major technical issues. they are welldocumented and are common place. but as this review is made in my own personal experience, which has been largely bugfree, i have found the game to be rather enjoyable. yes, it is rough around the edges, but i think this game can really shine with time and a bit of polish. i am really looking forward to what the developers will do going forwards with this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-19,awful game. i wish cdpr never again makes another game. bugs just don't let it work. very bad!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-18,"the game completely fails to meet the promises and expectations. if you can't keep your promises, don't give them. in fact, we got a very raw game, people pay for the finished product, and not for the fact that the patches will be edited."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-18,"amazing game, amazing story, amazing character. this game always be a masterpiece"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-18,"all npcs that arent related to the plot have random dialogue that rarely relates to the context theyre in. they give me flashbacks to oblivion dialogue, however, its not that bad. graphics are outstanding but terribly demanding. ive encountered very few bugs on pc, and none of them have been game breaking. plot is great but the diction in the writing is cringe as times. the world of cyberpunk 2077 is rich in inspiration and phenomenally interesting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-18,"i will not be talking about the bugs in this review, as i want to just strictly talk about the content of the game. cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most hollow games i have ever played. the first 5 hours are the best. you're really into it, driving around night city doing missions, and having a blast. but than after that first 5 hours, the game gets boring real fast. when you first open up the map, you are overwhelmed by the amount of markers and waypoints sprawling across the map. but than you realize it's only 3 fetch quest, dotted all over the map, with a couple of side missions here and there. the story is pretty decent, but not good enough to pull me in. the game looks gorgeous and night city looks incredible, but underneath the glowing lights and bustling buildings you see and empty game with no soul. nps's are stupid, struggling to even walk in a straight line. instead of getting into high speed police chases, like in gta 5, police just spawn behind you. they don't even use their cars, so if you commit a crime, you can just drive away and wait for them to stop spawning. it is an extremely disappointing game that is leagues below the witcher 3. hopefully cd project red learns from their mistakes, and starts making good games again. a man can only dream."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-18,"one of the most beautiful game i ever played. thank u cd project, an incredible story, and incredible work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-18,"compelling, immersive, emotive and visual spectacular, with an excellent story line, great voice acting and characters you genuinely feel for. by far the best depiction of the cyberpunk genre of all time, regardless of medium. unfortunately, too many bugs to justify a 10."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-17,"cyberpuke 2076 is a scam. this game makes fallout 76 look like a masterpiece. truth be told, this game made me love a lot many other bad games, it is so bad, after 40 hours and the major patch, i just gave up....cannot drag myself through this atrocity. it fails on every front and does not qualify as a video game. the only reason why i gave this 3 stars is the graphics, night city is beautiful but sadly that is the only strongest point. the game is a screenshot simulator at its best. initially, you will like what you see but as you progress, the cracks will start appearing. the ai is very bad and as a result of that, combat feels bland. the wanted system is horrible, gta 3 does a better job. the city feels empty, skyrim feels more engaging. the ui is a mess. the crafting, inventory management systems are sad. the game offers you the illusion of choices rather than actual choices that have any major impact on the story. you will experience bugsglitches every 23 mins...... i can go on and on and on...... sadly i was a witcher 3 fan when i went back, i realized that this game is a downgraded clone of witcher 3. it's sad that critics have praised this trash game. this is cybertrash 2076."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-17,"epic story, great 200h i wait for some dlc now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-17,"it definitely has its prons and cons... there are a lot of bugs  some of them break the game while there are others that just ruin the immersion but i hope that cdpr will fix most issues in the future! there are also a lot of mechanisms in the game that feel a bit raw an unfinished, such as the wanted and crafting system, really poorly executed, i believe the devs rushed them in order to release the game. on the bright side, the story is really good, and the game makes you really love the characters, while the side quests and all the dialogues are really beautyful! i believe it would be a masterpiece if they didn't rush it and fixed all the bugs and polished it a bit more"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-17,"a complete waste of time and money. witch all the lies and manipulations surrounding this game and cdpr they started turning in to bethesda. a company that doest do exclusives this game is a directx 12 exclusiv. and there is no excuse for not supporting directx 11. to ad insult to injury it is wery unfinished, and i mean like at least 2 years to early for its release. at this stage this game is worth meybe 10 bucks."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-17,"start of the game is great, you really feel like one little speck in meet grinder called world. fighting for survival, practically no one. doing some low level gigs just to earn some eddies. it's all great, and than, act 1 ends and.. well. magic is gone, you switch from another worthless piece of meet from street to rambo style superhero, evaporating anyone just by looking at them. high tech corpo soldiers with best military chrome available going against you in throngs. no problem bro, you just smash them to pulp in like 2 seconds. those almost godlike untouchable corpo bosses, fixers, anyone.. they just became clowns, easy to touch, no more aura of power or respect. that palpable aura of uncertainty, betrayal, feelings like no man.. this gig just can't end well which you get from act 1, gone. and that is really pity. but, game is still great, main quests are not bad at all. got good times just roaming around city, doing this gig and that, smashing perpetrators in ncpd quests. overall, game is good and definitely worth playing. don't mind much that quest are linear, gigs are just like playing mmorpg, go there, kill everyone or sneak through, click on one computervanbag and don't care for whatever backstory is there, because in another 2 seconds that would not matter at all. can be fun for some time, cause you are free to do it your way. once you just sneak around, other time charge with katana or handgun. character development is ok, you have plenty branches to specialize into. biggest issue for me is that game is so extremely easy, even on hardest difficulty. there is no need for planning your character, improving weapons, trying to get best chrome or guns, because.. you can easily smash anyone with just white common pistol and no perks.. and that is by my opinion big missed opportunity how to make game even more enjoyable. i understand that on pc with mouse and keyboard playing fps game is so much easier than on console with pad.. but there should be at least another 2 more options for game difficulty. overall, give it a try, even if you would just go through main story. you wont be bored."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-14,"spoiler i have a pc. i feel bad for all the people who bought this on ps4 but since i bought the pc version that's the version i can comment on. namely the version that's able to run on a rtx 3060. first of the game is absolutely gorgeous looking. if you have the pc that can run this at or near max settings than this is an easy buy for people that love eye candy. animation, effects, modelling and environment are all top quality. the aesthetics are so close to blade runner mythos that i can't help but get excited about delving further into the universe. music, story and narrative top quality. game play is the only place i'd take a single point off. felt the car driving was a bit floatish. the character customization and ability system allow for very different and diverse playing experiences. after finishing the game you can easily go right into a new play through and experience the game in an entirely new light."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-14,"great game, great immersion, great music, great characters, but poor quality. and nevertheless undeservedly low marks, therefore 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-14,"overall this game is great. there are for sure too many bugs and they should've kept this game in the works and not feel so pressured to release this when they did. i know this game has been in development for almost 10 years but this game could actually be a 10 if they just took more time. gameplay could be a little better, for me it's not bad but could be better. music is great, characters are great, story is great, and the bugs are terrible. overall i'd recommend to just wait to purchase this when a game fixing update comes out or a huge sale comes out. i really liked the game but the bugs make it not worth it right now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-13,"um hype que infelizmente no queria ter tido, o que provavelmente pesou na nota do jogo, mas nunca se promete o que no se pode cumprir e essa empresa precisa tomar isso como uma lio, a historia  muito boa at o prologo, mas depois?  totalmente decadente, escolhas que tem peso quase zero em sua gameplay, para o que  um rpg,  um pecado gravissimo, escolhas que s servem para mudanas de dialogos e nada mais, fora o sistema de relacionamento ser em minha opinio, completamente escasso, sem falar nos infinitos bugs um pior que o outro, cyberpunk 2077 me ensinou a nunca mais dar hype em jogos antes mesmo de seu lanamento, obrigado cyberpunk!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-13,"cyberpunk 2077 is the game we were waiting for big, funny, full of quests and with a lot of rpg aspects perfectly integrated in the gameplay. sadly it has a lot of bugs too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-13,"cyberpunk 2077, on a pc with decent hardware, is at least as good as the witcher 3. the graphics and level of detail reach from decent to absolutely breathtaking, depending on the location. the decisions you make are absolutely important, especially in the ending of the game. the side quests are nothing exceptional, but full of interesting gameplay, charachters and storylines. the main storyline though is simply amazing. the characters are all well written and the storyline is really creative. gameplay is also great. only negative point for me that the open world could use more live."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-13,"not sure if there is a major difference between the steamgog versions, but i refunded my steam copy a day after launch and recently picked up the gog version through a third party website that had it on a 55 off sale. note, many things will be listed under good and bad for different reasons... good main storyside quest npc's are well written. i found myself wanting to do more quests with panam, judy, river, etc. i wanted to get to know them much more. night city is stunning and filled with potential, but on the surface only. likewise with the badlands. bad main story. not the actual writing, but length. i was floored when i hit the point of no return quest. it felt as if i was only 50 done the main story. while i'm happy it's not as long as the witcher 3 or many open world games, this was far, far too short. night city...like i said, stunning world was crafted by cdpr, but only on the surface. after an hour or two or walkingrunning to missions you realize that's all this world actuall has to offer. mission after mission, not fun side quests. no doors to buildings to open and explore openlocked. it's a beautiful but hollow, empty city. police. forget about killing random npc's, police will just randomly turn on you. helped them a few times for them to only attack and spawn more while i was looting the scene. i also jumped off a second floor balcony in front of police and they attacked. worst police ai in gaming. npcs. when set to high they really add a lot of visual noise to night city. but that's just it. visual noise. they actually add nothing. they are far too alike, will often disappear if you look the other way, will run away or crouch in fear for no reason at all. like the police, worst npc ai in gaming. cut contentfeeling unfinished. this game feels rushed. every time i immerse myself in the world, around the corner is something that makes the game feel unfinished. life paths. this was my single and truly only major disappointment. the only night city stream i watched was the life path one. it was made out to be a fairly significant thing that would provide you with a solid and good reason to replay the game at least 3 times. in reality? the only major differences are the first 2030 minutes. after that the only major thing comes in dialogue choices which for my nomad, never made a difference one bit. bugscrashes for myself, i had no crashes at all. bugs for me also amounted to tposes, weapon display info staying on screen, items not lootable on the ground. don't recall having any game breaking bugs. having said that, everyone's experience with bugs will vary. looking on youtube shows that bugs can be a serious issue in this game for many. overall compared to when i played this game at launch, i did have fun with it. and there is fun that can be had with this game, but it does require overlooking many things. for myself, it reminds me of fallout 4. a very mediocre game that doesn't excel in anything but one that i can still sink many hours into. i gave the game a 5 simply because there were moments that it felt like a solid 8, but other times a 2. in it's current state it's a very middle of the road game, at best. should you buy it now? i'd say if you feel the itch to buy it, check out third party websites for sales, or simply wait for gogsteam to offer a 50 sale. otherwise i'd hold off still."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-13,great game! i'm currently playing for the second time and this game is awesome!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-13,my rating  3 stars 1 star for the graphics 1 star for the soundtrack 1 star for the level design this is not nexgen product. it's a halfbaked buggy dead open world lootershooter with interesting but short story and very bad looking keanu whose presence makes the gameplay and the story mindblowing but very silly.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-12,"pros design, story, music. cons literally everything else. ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-12,"if you have a great pc, some of the game looks very pretty. there's some snappy dialogue in there, too. pretty cool side quests. even if you have a great pc, however, the game is a sea of broken promises. enemy, police, and npc a.i. were better in gta iii. driving was better in watch dogs. there are none of the branching story paths that they promised."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-12,"this game is just awful. extremely overmarketed game that was promoted as next gen masterpiece, but it was all just a lie. it's time for ubisoft and rockstar games to show them how to make actually good games and they will! gta 6 is coming. far cry 6 seems to be great and ubisoft is working on open world star wars game. rockstar games proved with red dead redemption 2 that they are still best of the best and ubisoft's assassin's creed valhalla was pretty solid as well. can't wait for their new projects!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-12,i rate this game for 8 because of bugs. but i give 10 because i want to counteract this stupid review bombing kids who give this game 0 or 1. finally a good game with a mature story. this is the major factor making this game standing out from the crowd. its not just pew pew pew with guns and stupid chases with police and without any interesting story behind it. if anyone is looking for that kind of fun well... yes he will be dissapointed. it's not gta. this game is primarily a great great story. i would give 10 but the truth is that sadly there are many bugs. however they are not so bothersome as everyone is speaking. i had and still have a great fun with cyberpunk and i recommend it for all players who's looking for a solid story and a grat gameplay rpg.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-12,"oh man, from hype to pure disgust, the developer talked so high and blablabla, look what they gave to us, cyberjunk 6969"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-12,"feel betrayed, and not because i was on the hypetrain, and my expectations were unrealistic. i really don't mind the bugs, which will be ironed out surely. the issue is with the empty shell  if you go beyond the main quest  total immersion, living city, impactful decisions? forget it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,"story is passable, combat is mediocre, everything else is a disaster. character development, blah. side missions and choices, meh. immersion, world, etc  bad, very bad. let's not even get into the bugs and technical glitches which honestly, don't bother me too much, except as a reminder of how everything is quite badly done. just really feels like an unfinished game that started with way too much ambition and then had to be transformed into a standard shooter. keanu tries, but doesn't save it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,"this is my first review ever for metacritic. this game has been an authentic dissapointment. bought it on presale betraying my own politics of not buying before the game is released, and i screwed it up. don't buy it already. i couldn't even finish the game although i tried to do it fast. it was like when i slurped my medicine as fast as i could as a kid. don't buy yet. good idea, badly developed technically."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,"its love hate with this game. many great features and scenarios, many bugged. this game is great for what it is, it could be a lot better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,"first of all, i did not follow the hype train for this game. i learned not to trust any hype after the disaster called fable for xbox. instead i tried to avoid all videos and articles and my expectations were kinda mediocre when the game released. cyberpunk 2077 is an alright game, it does not deserve the bottom scores many users give it, nor does it deserve the 910 and 1010 several delusional professional game reviewers gave it. cdpr knows how to create interesting characters and a story that draws you into it. but they apparently lack the ability to create good gameplay. the driving , the gunplay is barely sufficient, the game world feels so very limited and repetative. you can barely enter any of the buildings and stores you see on the streets, the ai is outright terrible and it seems like 23 of the content in the game is missing. the game world wasn't the least bit immersive and there are so few things to do in the game if you arent doing quests or story missions. i did not have as many bugs as the majority seems to experience. the playthrough for me was kindof smooth. sure there were some wierd animations, and i got launched 200m from a window once, an enemy guard stuck in an elevator and so on but nothing serious. performance wise the game played alright after i applied an unofficial cpu patch for the game 3060ti  ryzen 3600. i followed digital foundrys performance guide to set the game up with a tweak or two. the game looks really nice with very detailed characters. not the best looking game i've seen but still beautiul graphics. i completed the main story along with a handful of side missions in around 45 hours of game time. and i have to say i enjoyed most of those hours even if i had a constant feel that this game could've been so much more. would i recommend it? if you like a story heavy game with cyberpunk setting, then yes. but for the best experience i also recommend that you wait a year or two to see if cdpr can fix some of the games shortcomings. i feel that the 40 i spent on the game on epic games store was reasonable for the entertainment it provided me. this game is somewhere between a 6 and a 7 for me. fallout 4 710 imo was a better game, but still kinda mediocre in my opinion so i cant give cyberpunk more than a 610. as a footnote i have to say that i really dislike cdpr for lying to and deceiving so many players around the world. they knew the game was in a bad shape but still pushed it out way too soon. this is nowhere near the most immersive game ever or any other lies they have told us. i tried my best not to let this affect my honest score and how i feel about the game itself. but i really hope they get punished for their fraudulent behaviour."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,"estafa, nos han engaado haciendonos pensar que la version de pc es buena y es igual que la de ps4 o xbox pero con mejores graficos , no compreis esto, es una perdida de dinero"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,"this game is an absolute masterpiece, if you are looking forward to buy iy do it now, the gameplay, the music... eveyithing makes you feel like you are v killing people around night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-11,a 9 out of 10 game. great story and characters. good gun play. stealth is the usual basic rubbish you get in games like this though. but i have to knock points off for the bugs. the game clearly wasnt finished.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-10,"it's over! i wonder how does it feel, cd pr fanboys to be in the losers club... it must be so , so incredibly sad... cyberpunk 2077 is the biggest blunder in vidya... an unmitigated disaster from hell"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-10,"after playing nearly 70 hours watching several times whether in the game or in videos on youtube that really a lot of content originally planned in cyberpunk 2077 have been removed or simplified, i decided to put a score of 2. like a lot of people i was very hyped by the game, by the trailers, and especially by the 48 minutes demo of 2018. so i ended up preordering the game, and somehow i regret it. but i liked the game, i have no doubt about that. it's not a question of optimization. the problem is everything that's missing, everything that's been removed, i'm getting more and more frustrated when i find out everything that started to be put in place, and then abandoned. the day all this content is there, i will change my grade. for the moment i don't recommend cyberpunk 2077, see what it will look like with future patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-10,jest dobrze a bdzie to jeszcze lepsza gra. poprawki czyni cuda i warto ju zagra bez obawy o bugi itp.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,does it deserve 0 or 10 point? no. but too many 0 points...................
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,trying not to spoil anything. i felt sadder than i ever have playing a video game at one point in the game. pros good story interesting back story cool characters awesome concept cons bad graphics bugsglitches not enough impactful choices clunky mechanics
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,"good game. i know it has alot of bugs but still it has a great story,great graphics and awesome gameplay. i think we should just wait for updates and let's not say that the game is awful because of the respect we have for cd project red."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,"oh god that is bad. so much advertised and so low delivered. they should have continue for another 23 years of development. you can see the huge potential, but nearly non of it is used. the tech. state 2 months after realease, it still does not remember language setting. all the time crashes. optimalisation ? what is that ?  got r5 3600and 3060ti  runs about 50fps rtx ultra but dlss is funny. works only sometimes. try to create char with and without and you will see. there is just super low resolution and no enhancement od dlss. the same is for nearly half computers in game, when you enter them. some looks great and some are worse than minecraft. did i mentioned crashes? let's say it at least 20 times again  2 months after release. yeah. you die  crash  don't forget to set up the language again, you drive over pack of trash and catapults you ? yeah yeah  dropped. okay. run it again. hey you know anbout language? save it and turn it of. next time remember about language. oh god i am so gratefull, that they refunded this trash. i am really sorry, i was hyped too, but my nose can not carry those huge pink glasses anymore and i have to face the reality. it is trash compared to what was advertised and promised."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,omg the worst game in 2020 you know that it is hard to trust cd projekt red from now on because it is not the first game from them starts very bad to be real not every time we have to wait for any updates to play cpr games
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,"i did not expect the cyberpunk 2077 game for 7 years like most players, so my expectations were not too much, but guinea bugs were too much, i did not like the gameplay, the feeling of hitting, the story was not bad, except for them, the game was beautiful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,"i'm not your typical open world aaa gamer, as i got bored by several gtas and assassin's creeds i tried to get into. for me the classical open world formula often ends up in chores. having a medium to high end pc i was unaffected by most bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-09,"best game i have ever played im active player for about 25 years. yes there are some bugs, but the sides stories are amazing, gameplay is very fun ang give you a lot of possibilities."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,bug bug bug bug... cyberbug i.a.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,"i vere very! enjoyed time what i have spent in night city! game is very beautiful, yes i saw maybe a lot of baggs but the wasn't so hard as everyone thinks. very enjoyed story lane, im pretty sure that i take little pause and try to finish this amazing game on more time at least!! amazing job cd project! we never fade away!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,"it's a shame that this game came out somewhat unfinished. yes, there are quite a few bugs and other things that aren't quite finished. but the game beneath those bugs is truly amazing. great story with very emotional endings, interesting and dislikable characters, wellwrittendialogue, great sidemissions that effect the main story. gorgeous open world, very high immersion due to to the firstperson perspective. the combat is incredibly fun with the right cyberware and weapons , though sometimes unbalanced. for me, the story and immersion can almost make up for the game's problems. this is a story and world i won't forget. still, there's a hell of a lot of cut content, missing or unfinished features and immersionbreaking bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,"enero 2021 ahora mismo? no, no lo recomendara por las cuestiones que ya se conocen en medios, canales de yt y en steam y que no perder mucho tiempo en comentar. la historia principal est bien pero tampoco es lo ms de lo ms. los grficos y la ciudad estn muy bien especialmente de da pero lastrado por un rendimiento horrible. es inmersivo pero los bugsglitches lo estropean. la conduccin es para colgar de los pulgares a los desarrolladores. un par de crasheos. las secundarias...pues salvando las de los personajes que nos irn acompaando, las dems pura morralla. lo cierto es que tienes varios finales. eleg uno, el que entenda que corresponda habiendo elegido al inicio corpo. de momento, no tengo el ms mnimo inters en probar los otros. iba a revolucionar todo, el mejor juego posible. y s, cuando lo arreglen no solo en consolas estar muy bien y ser altamente recomendable pero ahora no. juego de notable, alto si quieren, pero se esperaba una pt matrcula de honor. regusto amargo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,"perhaps the best rpg since ultima 7 serpent island. i play on pc and even from launch, day 1 the bugs are small if at all noticeable to me. zero crashes for me not 80 hours on. i think the negative reviews are from people who wanted another gta or fortnight. the reason things are clunky at level 1 is because our character is level 1! as you gain levels you become insane and the game play changes with every few levels and implants. just like an amazing rpg should."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,"developers have sold unfinished games before, but cyberpunk set a whole new precedent for how low you can go with it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-08,i love and hate this game. the story is emmersive and the side missions are as much fun as the main story. but the game is empty. there is no ai police or otherwise. the worl is interesting but the graphics of ps4 are uninteresting. many things were promised and none of them were delivered. i am really sad about it is beeing handelt. the bugs are sometimes funny and other times make you very angry.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-07,preordered the game and i still haven't been able to play it because it's broken. even after two months of its release all the major bugs and ai problems persist. moral of the story never preorder any game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-07,"honestly its so good, just love the world, combat and exploration. truly sets a standard for open world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-07,the worst game i have played. i dont think anyone should buy this game. so many bug. i'm very disappoint about this game. i think i wasted my monney in a worst game ever
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-07,"so the hype train derailed and left cyberpunk 2077 in the sidings... or did it? okay, so it is not as immersive as the developer would have had us believe, nor is it quite as glossy as the e3 trailers led us to believe. and no, it would seem that choices do not matter in this game half as much as we wanted them to, not even as much as they did in the witcher 3. so why have i rated this game 10 out of 10? because regardless of the negativity surrounding the launch bugs included, this is the best damn rpg ever made! the graphics at least on pc are jawdropping. the gameplay is second to none you want a sneaky stealthalike, this is it... blows the likes of deus ex out of the water, and the hacking minigame actually makes you think ... a little bit. you want a gungho run n' gun, you can't go wrong here. and the number of weapons, customizations, and crafting options will keep you coming back for more. as if that's not enough the stories, writing, voice acting, character development, etc. are all in a league of their own ok so we expect at least this from cdpr, but you can't knock them down when they've only themselves to beat. there is so much to do in night city, i played this game for 7 days straight, about 14 hours a day stuck in lockdown there's not a lot of time for anything but gaming, right? before i decided i needed a break from it. and i still haven't seen everything the game has to offer. i completely understand the negative reviews for this game but, put the hype and disappointment to one side and look at it objectively... there isn't anything else in the world right now that is anywhere near as good as this and there probably won't be for the foreseeable future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,"i' been playing this for some weeks on my pc, which is not power full, and it goes good, the most bugs i've seen could be 6 strange situations and nothing else, the story is nice, is not predictable and have good twists, the game play have many things to fix, but come on what can you spect from a game that you and the community forced to come with out being finished."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,"very fun game, customization is great, all jokes aside. and fun gameplay. the ai isn't great, but overall a great game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,the performance in my opinion is good on pc. i tested on 2 systems one with a ryzen 7 2700x  a 5700xtin fhd and i can play it easy with arround 6070 fps on ultra settings. on my ryzen 9 3900x  rtx 3080 it runs with maxed out settings  rtx in qhd on a stable 5070 fps in the city with dlss performance while in the badlands arround 90110 fps. and it looks insane on both systems. the story is top notch and the writing is glorious i did really enjoyed every second of it. also the side quest lines are extremly great writen and makes a lot of fun. the combat system is a bit clunky in melee but gunplay makes fun and feels great. nighty city is a beautful designed city but it is not what we got promissed the city is lifeless but imo it isnt even bad. the immersion is still great. the ai is braindead  its simply non existence which is sad. cops act like complete brain damaged and spawn everywhere. to the bugs i didnt had any major bugs while playing on pc. with major i mean gamebreaking or which made me want to quit the game. most bugs where funny but at the current state 1.12 i dont see many bugs tbh. clothing feeles like u cant get your style in the early game cause u need that armor but after u gain some lvl like 20 u just dont need to care anymore and build ur look with the armor defense mods and look what u want to look. for me this game is a truly masterpiece even with the points i critic i give it a 10 cause i loved every one of my current 185 hours on pc and cant wait for what cdpr is doing with cyberpunk in the future.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,"great game overall, i love the story, the open world, and the soundtrack, but that's all it has going for it, otherwise, it's either not mindblowing or very underwhelming, such as the game's physics, the combat is very shallow. i'm giving it a very high score just because the story itself is enough to make me love it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,the main story and side quests are awesome. the skill system and character devlopment is insane. the graphic is lovely. found only one bug so far.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,"this game was not finished, but i paid full price for it 1 year ago. huge letdown from cdpr. ps. npcs have basic ai, they are super dumb. fix them asap, pls."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-06,"i came to cyberpunk with a degree of suspicion. there was a huge amount of hype and a lot of promises that made me suspicious that we might be building ourselves up for another no man's sky... and i'm pretty certain that is where we have ended up. massive expectations and a mediocre game. if you want the tldr, there is a good game in there under the bugs and other crap. i've enjoyed it well enough and will probably finish the game, but won't be coming back. for something that sets out to be immersive, cyberpunk falls pretty damned short. maybe get it when it comes on sale. before i start it is worth pointing out that i'm coming at this game with a highend pc so haven't experienced any of the performance issues that an awful lot of people have been having. the good bits  the story it is entertaining and the characters are well written. some people might disagree on that, these things are quite subjective, but i have, for the most part, quite enjoyed that aspect of the game. the immersive aspects the story sitting down and drinking while talking to people is a nice touch and they do take time in the conversations to flesh out the characters. the bad bits  the bugs holy mackerel batman, are there a lot of these! random tposing npcscorpses, suddenly teleporting across the screen, turning bald when you look in the mirror, unlootable robot bodies, your health bar suddenly showing zero hp and never going up or down... traffic npc spawning driving down the road and having a truck spawn 5 feet in front of your vehicle is pretty damned aggravating.  vehicles driving is painful. i only just realised there was a handbrake. it doesn't appear to do anything.  character choices there are only one or two main missions where you can do anything that make an iota of difference to what happens in the world. the bits that could have been so much more...  the graphics don't get me wrong, the ray tracing is very pretty, but the reflective surfaces don't reflect you or a large proportion on npcs i'm assuming because they pop out of existence when you turn away from them and that really breaks immersion once you realise that you are a vampire. interestingly a modder has discovered there is a line in one of the files that you can change from 'false' to 'true' to allow your reflection to show. why is it off by default? because your character doesn't actually have a head model most of the time. once you realise this you can also see this in shadows  v's head looks like the reflection of a volley ball.  character customisation what is the point? you literally only see v when you are driving a carmotorbike, on the menu screens or when you are looking into the bathroom mirror you walk up to them and activate them and then it shows your face... as a bald person if you happen to have a hatglasses on. you also can't change v's appearance after creation. not that it matters that much.  equipment upgrades in theory you can keep a piece of equipment you love and keep upgrading it as you level... but the cost goes up each time you do that to the point where it becomes impossible. so generally it's better to just forget about it altogether and use the best crap in your inventory. yes, v will look like a clown, but it's not like you see v anyway.  the perks and body mods kinda feel like something that was tacked on and isn't that necessary. you could complete the game without bothering.  nonlethal attacks is there any point to not straight up killing people apart from the very small number of missions where they say you should aim to take a boss down without killing them? there's a nonlethal takedown you can use on mooks in stealth mode, but i've yet to ever see a reason why you'd use that instead of killing someone."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-05,"it's a decent game but has a lot of really bad elementsmechanics that really should not be there after all the great games of the past including their own tw3. it's certainly way overhyped and that's the studios fault completely. runs fine, at realistic settings for your system but not insane settings. the bugs for me were totally cosmetic 99.9 of the time, no game breaking bugs for me. things like the driving mechanics are a total joke, the lack of switching to and from 3rd person other than driving is just not good for a modern open world game. all those clothes etc customization and you barely see it. map is atrocious and ugly, constant  on the phone, terrible minimap, no real exploration for side missions it's all with a big ? etc all over the eye gouging map. the story is ok, nothing epic about it, most of the endings are not satisfying at all and are depressing. the holes in the story and game world are legion. there is no proper true after campaign playing. the world looks great but is empty a lot of the time or has terrible ai space filler bots. the long distance away moving cars are embarrassing, i mean did they play any gta's since 4 at all? where are any flying possibility for these cyborgs of the future? why drive ground cars that look like fancified cars of the past? you can turn off a lot of offensive material but not the vulgar offensive language, the marxist social agenda in this is obvious and revolting. cpdr is staffed with occultist scum writers etc. keaneu reeves can take a hike, totally dirt bag and the off putting hollywhoring adds nothing to the game. runs fine without rt, with rt it's a 20fps hit on a 2060, avg of 40fps 1080p medhigh, without rt 60. i think some quality dlc can help this game, even free would help to make up some good will for this disgraced studio. with doing all the major missions, two full endings, many side missions and skipping most of the police missions with a lot of exploration i had about 60hrs so it's a decent value for the money afa hoursdollars. it has no replay value for me at all, uninstalled it already."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-05,"jugado en un series x es una experiencia muy grata, una verdadera joya visual"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-05,"banther poodoo !! avoid this game at any cost. a buggy,. empty world with little or no game play"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-05,"first off, the context had to create an account to counterbalance the review bombing which is obviously going on here yay for media hype, so i figured a review for this game would be in order. i deliberately did not watch any previews of this game, so i had no expectations going in and that might color my judgement. im playing this game on a 7700k, 1070, 32gb mem, most settings on medium to ultra following the digital foundry guide and im 105 hours into my first run. the good despite the minor glitches and bugs, cdpr managed to deliver a great open world rpg game. the design  worldbuilding of this game is nothing short of amazing and on this scale unique. the quests and storylines are well written and managed to  me into the world of cp2077. there are plenty of side missions and hustles to keep you occupied between the mainline quests. the soundtrack is great and visually the game is pretty good, at times had me be amazed what they managed to push out of my old 1070. the bad not going into the console drama here, apart from saying that obviously should not have been released like that. on the pc however, with a decent pc, this game is perfectly playable. are there no issues? well it wouldn't be an openworld rpg without loads of bugs items sometimes can't be picked up, prop items might sometimes float in thin air, items on the floor might push you out of crouch making stealth a challenge at times and when youre running, you encounter a lot of twin npcs on the street. there are also obvious features missing no option to adjust your appearance. no way to modify the appearance of your clothes, causing you to look like an idiot most of the game. the crafting system needs rework, it does not seem to be worth it at this time. the car handling needs rework, it's doable, but far from gta5 great. conclusion right now ive rated this at an 8, it would be a 9 if the bugs are fixed and a solid 10 if they reworkimplement the missing features. despite that though, im having a hell  time playing this game and in my opinion its the best in its kind so far. i hope that cdpr will continue to fix bugs, implement missing features, support modding and make this great game even better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-05,"dejando aparte las expectativas que gener este juego antes de su lanzamiento, hay que decir que est bastante bien en su versin actual, la 1.1. hay que tener claro que te tiene que gustar el gnero de los juegos de rol del tipo occidental, como puedan ser los de elder scrolls, the witcher, fallout, etc. si es as, ests de suerte. voy a resumir lo que me ha parecido de la siguiente manera  grficos y tecnologa 810. formidables grficos de ltima generacin eso s, a costa de requerir un pc los suficientemente potente. el conjunto se ve deslucido por la existencia de los famosos bugs, as como unas fsicas no demasiado depuradas, la mejorable inteligencia artificial de los npc y enemigos, o que queden al descubierto el uso de los tpicos trucos de programador como el de simular el trfico de coches a lo lejos con unos bucles en dos dimensiones demasiado aparentes y que te sacan un poco de la inmersin.  msica 1010. obviamente, puedes ser ms o menos amante de los estilos musicales que aparecen el juego en mi caso soy ms del estilo clsico de, por ejemplo, skyrim pero no podemos dudar de que la banda sonora es de alta calidad y con abundante variedad. eso s, un poco pesada la msica que suena mientras dura una situacin de combate.  sonido 1010. aparte de la calidad efectos sonoros no puedo dejar de alabar el estupendo doblaje de las voces que aportan ese plus de calidad  historia 910. siendo ste un apartado vital en un juego de rol, creo que est muy bien resuelto. no es muy original, vale, pero el guin de la historia principal bien podra servir para una pelcula, y hasta las misiones secundarias crean tramas paralelas que estn muy bien diseadas y resultan entretenidas.  jugabilidad 810. habra que destacar que es muy recomendable jugarlo al menos en el modo difcil si tienes experiencia en estos juegos, pues con un nivel de dificultad ms bajo no  en aburrirte al volverse las misiones demasiado facilonas en cuanto subes un poco de nivel. se juega como todo juego de rol vas haciendo misiones con las que obtienes experiencia y en las que consigues dinero. acumulando la experiencia se van produciendo los clsicos aumentos de nivel con lo que mejoran tus atributos y tienes la posibilidad de ir mejorando habilidades concretas de forma personalizada, segn tus gustos o manera de jugar. con el dinero podrs comprar mejores armas y equipamiento... de tal manera que cada vez sers ms poderoso y podrs avanzar enfrentando misiones ms complejas. en resumidas cuentas, nada que no tengamos visto ya en otros juegos del gnero. pese a esa falta de originalidad, el juego se deja jugar muy bien y combinado con la buena historia produce que se den esos momentos de venga, voy a jugar un poco ms, que quiero saber qu ocurre a continuacin, o me paso otra secundaria ms y lo dejo, o venga, que estoy a punto de subir al nivel 16. llego, mejoro esta habilidad y me voy a la cama,o ... le faltan detalles para llegar a la perfeccin una mejor inteligencia artificial, tanto de enemigos como de los compaeros que ocasionalmente te acompaan un sigilo mejor resuelto y con ms incidencia pues da igual superar las situaciones de manera sigilosa que entrar como un elefante en la chatarrera y liarte a tiros contra todo quisqui, de tal manera que al final terminas optando por lo segundo, el haber aprovechado mejor las situaciones de conduccin de vehculos, el potenciar la exploracin de la ciudad de forma independiente al seguimiento de alguna misin principal o secundaria para lo cual deberan existir actividades que pudieras realizar fuera de estas, cosa que no sucede, etc. precio 710. como triple a que es, siempre se espera un poco ms. a m en concreto me ha sabido a poco pese a hacer un gran nmero de misiones secundarias. no es que sea corto, me habr costado mis 80 horas y apurando un poco ms seguro que habra llegado a las 100. pero me hubiera gustado poder perderme por el mundo del juego durante mucho tiempo ms, especialmente viendo el potencial que tiene. comparndolo con algunos sus predecesores a los que he jugado the witcher 3, skyrim, fallout new vegas cuando llegu a los crditos finales me qued con esa sensacin de ya est, esto ha sido todo?. quin sabe, a lo mejor con los dlc y el multijugador la cosa mejora, pero yo valoro el juego a da de hoy... y adems no estoy seguro de que vaya a volver a l tenemos taaanto a qu jugar y taaaan poco tiempo para ello. mi recomendacin, si no lo tienes ya, sera que esperases a una buena reduccin de precio o a que hayan aadido el contenido prometido. y si ya lo tienes, pues tampoco te vayas a arrepentir jugalo y disfruta de la experiencia que tampoco te va a defraudar."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"people come to your senses! why are you so humiliating a game whose developers were not afraid to bring so many new things to the game industry? yes, it's not perfect ... yes, it's poorly optimized ... yes, it's buggy. but, there are so many amazing things in it! great story, beautiful game world, addictive gameplay, flawlessly designed side quests. a few years will pass and you will be ashamed of your words, and so was the witcher 3. if you do not see all the beauty and advantages of cyberpunk 2077, i am sincerely sorry for you. this game, albeit not without flaws, has every chance of becoming a cult. 10 of 10."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"could be such more. forget about the glitchs and performance.cyberpunk compared with what witcher was, could be much, much and much more. biggest disappointment in gaming history."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"a lot of work went into the open world, but not the right kind of work. things look amazing and aside from a lot of superficial bugs, it ran pretty well for me i played on a highishend pc. however, the open world was quite simply boring. they added hundreds of little microquests on the map, but they consist of killing 57 guys sitting around a car or a flaming barrel or container over and over and over again. i decided to clean up the map of all these quests and then focus on the main story, and poof, the main story was over before it got started. i later saw that this was by design because their analytics showed not enough people finished witcher 3 to their liking. what kind of stupid logic is that? i didn't follow this game prerelease, so i didn't feel the absence of promised features i just got a boring openworld with a good main story which feels about the length of a call of duty game. terribly disappointing."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"oh what a game this could have been, had it just been released in 2022 or even 2023. but as of february '21 this game is just unplayable on a ps4 pro. i know it's a little better on pc. if you have a good graphics card it looks fantastic, but even with slightly less bugs of which there are thousands this game is just empty. the main story is done in 18 hours max., the side quests, gigs and gang fights are extremely repetetive, and the side stories mostly not worth mentioning. driving cars is no fun at all, you have no flying vehicles and the npc routines and behaviours are laughable. these are simple game mechanics that we have been used to for years in games like gta5, but you have none of that here. not even the presence of keanu can save this game. there is no immersion whatsoever, since whatever you do in this game, there is another bug that is reminding you that you are playing an unfinished, broken game. given that cdpr had such a great reputation and the witcher 3 is one of my all time favorite games, cyberpunk 2077 is just a big fat disapointment . i had high hopes and was really looking forward to playing that game, but in this state even with all the hotfixes and patches it should simply not even be in stores. what a shame! how on earth some critics score this game at 100 is beyond me. i don't believe that they really played the game. this actually is the first game ever which i regret buying."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"this release is an audacity! what we got here is a tech demo, but not a real 60 game. it is unfinished and everyone giving this a rating above 610 has either played it for less than an hour or simply is lying. the overhyping did it a serious disservice as cd projekt red did not deliver what they promised. 1 being a nextgen benchmark game cp2077 fails in this category. sure with the raytracing on and ignoring the bugs and some buttugly npc character models it looks very good but not great!, i got serious blade runner vibes, but unfortunately the gameplay mechanics are anything but next gen we've seen it all before in other games and mostly better!  stealth is bare bones and works like every other stealth game  shooting is as basic as it can get and enemies are bullet sponges. think fallout 3 shooting but without vats  craftingdismantlinglooting is all here, all as we are used to. you can loot anything even in plain sight of the owner, they won't mind socialism has won in the nusa. the typical hunt for dps weapons and armor class items, shoot, loot, equip or selldiscard  the open world looks good but nothing groundbreakingly new here either several symbols indicate side quests, there's your gps and quest markers and onscreen prompts of what to do when you reach your destination. here it does make sense with all the implants, but next gen? nope.  basic leveling as we are used to as well. level stats and pick perks. it's been done in overabundance even by ubisoft titles. 2 controls! they are horrible. mainly driving  which you will be doing a lot. if you try to go with first person view driving for immersion visibility is almost zero, drive up a ledge, you won't see anything. braking takes about a mile not joking to a complete stop at 100mph. turning in a curve feels like driving a tank rather than a car, while being a passenger turning in a curve feels like a person turning rather than a car. traction is horrible, expect to plow through the sidewalks and hit everything left and right of you. far cry 5  gta 5 did it much better. this is easily the worst driving mechanic in any game i have ever played. 3 alive open world epic fail. stealing looting goes unpunished. kill somebody, cops will just pop up behind ! you and kill you. no options to surrender or bribe your way out of it. npcs are numerous but dumb some are literally glued to a spot day and night, others will pop in, walk down a road and fade out again, using the same throwaway line over and over when you try to interact with them. vehicle operators are just as braindead park a car in the middle of the road will cause a roadblock with them patiently waiting for you to move your vehicle. traffic lights for player are always green. don't expect patrolling cops like in gta 5 or saint's row, you will see randomly spawning in crime scenes or when you kill somebody or run over somebody when you try to drive a vehicle they will just pop in to kill you. the wanted system is terrible you can easily rundrive away i prefer to run, since driving is a catastrophe, break line of sight for 10 seconds and all is forgiven  forgotten. cops cannot operate vehicles. the cyberpunk world is devoid of life. 4 decisions and consequences again a fail. multiple options to solve a quest exist by dialogue, sneaking or killing, but it's just as basic as we've seen in games like skyrim before. i felt the witcher 3 had more options, more paths and more interesting choices and impacts, here it only affects how much cash reward you get occasionally. the story wasn't really all that gripping either and the origins prologue lasts for about 1520 minutes each. here they definitely could have been done much more as there are only 3 life paths! this is a wasted opportunity. 5 cut content  2018 demo comparison. several elements that were promised in preproduction were cut in the final release. things like 3rd person cut scenes, metro rides, wall climbing, corrupt cops. i also think the 2018 demo version looked much better, not as overly bright, hud of cars, character models in general. the downgrading of the graphics is not on an epic negative scale as in witcher 3, but still noticeable. several storylines feel cut as well. it seems the entire wanted system was implemented 5 minutes before the game was rushed out the door and it is very apparent that they thought well, it's better than nothing?! i am sorry to have to say cp 2077 looks goodish and can be fun while it is new and the illusion lasts, but will fall apart quickly after you've explored most of night city. after a few hours i felt like doing something else rather than playing cp 2077, that is bad for a 60 game. dont even think of mentioning cyberpunk 2077 and goty in the same sentence! 1995's tekwar had a better open world and that game was crap!!."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. just like tw3 it has some bugs, none of them gamebreaking, at least for me. i will split this review in 5 parts visuals cyberpunk 2077 is the most demanding pc game i've ever played, but it delivers a truly next gen experience, with advanced graphics technologies. the characters look stunning, the world design and atmosphere is simply perfecto. but it has some downs, like the draw distance, the popping or 2d cars rendering in the distance. gameplay playing cyberpunk 2077 is really fun. its combat system is very good and smooth except when you're fist fighting, it has a lot of weapons, powerups and tech hacks. the bugs are also here, like enemies dissapearing, immortal bosses some times or cars exploding near you. story maybe cyberpunk's strongest point. the transition from good to amazing in the game, v's charisma, relations with other characters and every mission is just perfect. the rpg component is also rock solid, with a lot of dialogues and options to choose. there's no argumental voids or any like that. sound another big up for the game. the chosen soundtrack is amazing, with songs like chippin' in or rebel path stuck on my head, it makes it memorable. the voice, weapons and environment sounds are also excellent. innovation how cd projekt improves tw3's legacy with cyberpunk 2077? pretty good i will say. both of them are excellent rpg games, graphically cyberpunk is way ahead but in terms of game play tw3 is way better. the breakpoint here is story, despite i love geralt's story i must say that cyberpunk 2077 has a more complex and better developed story. also i rather that futuristic atmosphere than medieval personal taste. conclusion cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game, like every game it has bugs and glitches, but nothing that cd projekt couldn't fix. i played for 65 hours, i'm on my 2nd playthrough and it feels great just like the first time. p.s. i only played pc version of the game, i won't talk about ps4 or xbox one versions."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"this game is honestly dissapointing. especially the prize. why would i pay 60,00 for a game that runs on 30 fps, has tons of glitches and bugs and has barely any npc detail at all. and this game was in development for 7 years and its not even good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"first english is not my native language. i played fallout 2 when i was 7. i dit not even knew english, can you imagine? that game never shows you where to go or what to do, you have to discover and talk english to npc's. it was a 2d game and it felt awesome. i fell in love with rpg's, later i played games like planescape torment, kotor, mass effect, so cyberpunk was like a childhood dream came true for me. when i play cyberpunk, i feel like i'm 7 again. i always dreamed playing a fallout type game in 3d with amazing graphics. this game finally did it for me. i bought double jump and started to roam around night city usually without a car. normally my pc cant run cyberpunk, but i can play thanks to gforce now. this is the most detailed game i played but i dont know never games so i cant compare. i drive and walk carefully like its real. like after gtav i could tell that this games driving mechanics are bad, but its not true for me cos i drive like id drive in real life. this way driving feels more realistic and fun. btw sound desing is awesome and fluid. one time i literally go in to a trance watching  with deep city sounds. when i walk and hear lightness of my footsteps, i feel like im walking myself. gunplay is nice, stories are fun, just two things could be better in my opinion more choices and more openable doors. except from side missions and small time criminals, there is not much to do cos nearly all doors are locked, you cant go inside most buildings. i hope that they will improve this in dlc's or whatever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-04,"one od the best games i ever play. good dialogs,graphics od course little bugs top but its still very good game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,"after more than 20 hours of playtime and several completed quests i can say this game is totally junk. game breaking bugs all around, i'm so sorry i didn't take my money back when i had the change. could have been a good game because of the story and some interesting side quests but the poor quality of the game amazes me at every corner. in any case this game is not a rpg more action oriented and that's it. get it at half price next year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,i played the game on ps5 and it ran just fine. i had some minor issues here and there. i finally rejoined the pc master race after my pc died a few years ago. this was the first game i bought for my new rig! i have loved every second of it so far on my new play through
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,"cyberpunk 2077 me dio mas de 80 horas de juego, varios bugs y crasheos, pero fuera de eso es excelente en todos sus apartados, desde historia a desarrollo de personajes. lo recomiendo mucho pero hasta mediados o finales de este ao."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,"the game is nevertheless a milstone. it has an incredible setting, great story, cool caracters, improval fighting action, shiny graphics, fresh looks, hours of exploring and keanu reeves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,a mi parecer tuvo un inicio incierto pero despus se va convirtiendo en un juegazo
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,"the game may have its bugs and ai shortcomings, but they are overshadowed by the rest of the excellent aspects. the city has an amazing atmosphere  refined and detailed locations, lighting, neon lights reflecting off the roads at night, all accompanied by a perfect soundtrack. you can really feel cyberpunk vibes here. the only downside to the engaging story is that it is too short. luckily, there's a whole bunch of some of the best side quests i've ever completed in an rpg game. each of them has its own depth, intriguing characters and atmosphere. the writers did a really great job here. the most memorable one for me was the quest in which i had to track down a kidnapper of young men. the atmosphere, mystery, and on top of that on of the the coolest features in the game  braindance  all of this made this quest unforgettable. i really recommend it, every player should experience it for themselves. if you love a good plot and atmosphere in games  don't hesitate and play it, the ai and bugs on pc are just a small part of this amazing game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,"i think that ignores the large number of bugs in the game. in fact, this game is a masterpiece, a masterpiece that unfortunately the development team has not fully overcome its difficulty. great story, great atmosphere and characterization, visual effects, great upgrade system, and a whole host of other options that should not be overlooked because of bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-03,"edit for a thorough review, google overpromise, sell, underdeliver cyberpunk 2077 by crowbcat. that's all folks  original mediocre gunplay, terrible driving experience, below average storyline, and characterless ingame inhabitants behaviour. once again, all the hype surrounding this game's claim of nextgen fpsrpg raised expectations beyond what was delivered. one can tell the engine used was developed in the 2010s the bugs and slow ui are a tell, not to mention it's ai's shameful arcadelike responses selecting a harder difficulty only raises the ai's damage and hp, not their intelligence  tldr this is a playable previousgen arcade shooter rpg. nothing new, only average gameplay and old tech. a mix between gta 5 and deuxex without achieving any of the good points of those games. give it a pass, you won't miss much."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"just the fact so many review sites are claiming this buggy sorry excuse  as being goat is clear sign that they are getting bought off by devs. this game is fun for 3 hours. the 2 initial hours and the ending. thats it. sidequests and gigs are just polyfila to squeeze 50hours of game time in an empty shell . the only reason i give it a 3 is because on a high end pc the graphics are very impressive. but the quantity of bugs, major glitches, bad mecanics, stupidly useless leveling system, bad crafting, boring characters for the most parts, makes this game one of the biggest let downs of my lifetime. trash game, not worth 20 even on special. cd projekt just trying to ride the witcher 3 wave all the way to the bank with overhyped garbage new ip. if ea or ubisoft release this game, people would have burned down their offices."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"well after asking for a refund for this unfinished game and not getting it i can only recommend you not waste your money like i did. i really have to repeat myself. this is not a finished product by any means any i am not sure it will ever get finished. main story is very very i mean very short! a handful unique quests and a lot of repeatable quests steal x or kill x these have no impact on anything, just to keep you busy. this game has nothing in common to the quality of the witcher franchise. i still can't believe it's from the same devs. gamebreaking bugs everywhere and almost all the time cdpr said we could get refunds. careful! this is not true! i asked for a refund and did not get it!! i am sure of one thing. this is the last game i am going to buy from this studio! after playing a lot of hours of this game one phrase comes to mind cash grab!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"cp2077 has a lot of bugs, but hope all will be fixed soon. despite of that  best game i ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"i'm not the kind of person who writes review but on my pc this game is fantastic. yeah it's true, there are some bugs and in some points it hasn't a good optimization.. but the graphics is really good. the production had tried to raise the bar and so it isn't normal not found any problems, but the game is playable without any difficult. the gameplay is acceptable, the story is not too much original but very admirably, like secondary quest. i'll remember this game because there is a before and an after when i played this game. recommended."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"i think always playing in first person with no option to change to third person or at least during conversations, special moments, and so on absolutely destroys the immersion. i also think that v isn't the main protagonist, its johnny! and what absolutely didn't work out was that everything in this game makes you depressive. v looses everyone and everything, and we as a player get the feeling we have somehow to redeem him, save him, or at least make him unforgettable. but no, the happy ending is just that v dies nevertheless. there is no point in playing this game at all except to please others, he's just a pawn. if you think, that cd red announced cyberpunk 2077 around 8 years ago and compare the actual result to that fact. i guess, it means they basically haven't done anything. it seems like they started working a year ago. were they procrastinating? did they have to change the whole game because of keanu reeves joining, basically build the game around him? ubisoft launches every 2 year a new ac title, which in my opinion is a far better product than cp at this point of time. i am not sure what really went wrong but honestly, i lost my trust in this company. after spending almost 200h on the witcher 3, combined with the promotion and marketing and the promises of cd red regarding cp 2077, i maybe did expect a little bit too much but maybe not though. i don't know, but this could have been the best game ever and not a downgrade. but it is just another anthem, no mans sky, and so on.. ps i have spent around 150h in cp, i do absolutely not complain about the good work of the designersprogrammersaudioengineersand so on, they really did a great job, but it is clear even this guys cannot change what only the management can do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"this game very well shows how the developers intended to make a great game, but couldn't... with big bad on the top calling the shots. this game deserves a redemption story, but the current numbers of the game's score look too inflated for every platform. there needs to be a lot of work put into this game until it becomes a 90 at best, never a 100, but it's already considered an 85? for what? pretty eyes and sweet lies?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-02,"cyberpunk nie zawodzi, cho nie jest mesjaszem gamingu. mamy tutaj wietn fabu i bohaterw, na poziomie absolutnie najwyszym. czekajmy na poprawi bo gra przejdzie do historii."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,welcome du the world of cyberbug 2077. the first 6hours of the game 1010 but after that you realise how a big scam this is. cant give more than 110 and the one point is only for the graphics. dont buy that game until its maybe patched after 5 years
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,"a scam which people protect for some reason. this game does not meet standards set by games twenty years ago, in some cases even thirty years ago. seriously."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,"i was very upset lime most of the people because of the critics, comparisons of game mechanics with rockstar games, ai, bugs, glitches, optimization and etc. but after playing the game, things started to change for me.. don't expect to play something like a bethesda rpg, or rockstar rpg, this is a cd project red rpg, its more like an action game. ok it doesnt give you a full freedom and game worlds interactions are limited like witcher 3.. so what!! it doesnt kill the gameplay. you have plenty of occasional mission options and a good written main story with well planned cinematic gameplay. play it like you played witcher 3 and you will definitely love it. optimization was not good but i played the game after 1.1 version released and with an old rigryzen 1600x gtx 1060 16 gb ram i can play it on medium level graphics smooth and well. visuals and fps values are good enoughreally. this is a great game of its kind, you will be satisfied."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,"excelente jogo, rodou perfeitamente no meu xbox sries s, sem nenhum problema que impedisse o meu gameplay"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,despite of bugs and game crashes this game brings you very unique experience. nowadays we have forgot that computer games should be something more than just pretty sandbox with simple storyline and simple character. cyberpunk lets you face night city on your own. comparing this game with gta is completely out of place because this game offers something more than just bad physics and plenty of bugs. try yourself
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,"better after the two recent updates. but the game was never bad, it was poorly optimized and then blown out of proportion. played since release day and i have run into more game breaking glitches requiring a reload or application close on assassins creed valhalla than i have in cyberpunk. but bandwaggoners jumped up at the chance to attack this game despite it being no worse than half of the games bethesda and ubisoft drop regularly. i think we should hold devs to higher standards. but folks really went off on cdpr for the same crap they let other devs get away with on the regular. i have lost hours to glitches in ac valhalla,and there were tons of optimization issues, but people praised it as award worthy. cdpr releases a game in, arguably the same state as valhalla, and people go on a witch hunt. the gameplay, mechanics and story are great. the romance options could be better, the graphics could be more polished, and the world could be more full with activity and the harmless visual glitches  although funny  do need some more fixing. but to be fair, this is the common state of most game drops these days."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,"the shame of the generation. beyond the bugs and technical problems that can be corrected through updates, the problem is how cd project and part of the press has laughed at the players. they were selling us how advanced the game would be in each technical and playable section and it has turned out that a high percentage of that is a lie and is even well below games of more than 10 years ago. it is even sadder how fans of cd project keep lying to themselves saying that the game is incredible and that as it is an rpg it does not have to stand out in other aspects i.a. void, teleporting cops, unfinished parts of the city, ridiculous physics, it's even very basic like rpg, its decisions, its character creation and a dead city of content. giving this game more than a 0 is not wanting or not liking video games. that it is not repeated with any other. it is a mistake to rate this game better on pc than on other platforms. even looking better graphically for sheer power, most of the bugs are present in pc and all the lack of content that we also advertised. check all the news of what would be the final game and you will see that almost none of that has reached the final product"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,"simply one of the best games i've ever played. the story is beautiful just  level of the witcher at least. at the end this game gave me a fair tear of joy and sadness. the main thing is to ignore or the hate from people, who, simply put, think popular  bad. the game has lots of problems  not only technical, but gameplay too. this game is not even close to being perfect, but it is right at the spot to be soultouching. i hope you personally won't judge it by the hate, or by the praise like this one, but rather try it out by yourself. good luck in night city, choomba!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-02-01,the best game of this decade. i know there are a lot of bugs but cdp red will fix them and there were no more problems with them. and panama best written love story and character as i saw applaud cdp red
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"so i played on gtx 1060, graphics were fine but not amazing low settings, no lags. the best game i played in a long time. what i liked story, fight mechanics and dynamic, leveling system, music, mapcity design. game doesnt have good ai, cop mechanics, traffic isnt great, but i was enjoying driving  arcade and easy, so you have time to look around . i didnt encounter game breaking bugs, although i encountered a lot of funny ones. i would add to the game some utility things like barbershops, restaurants, bars where you can actually sit and drink e.t.c."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"from me, the game is great. it was really an experience that transported me to the world of the future in which i spent and lived dozens hours. the game is really immersive from a first person point of view, especially the atmosphere and the design of how everything looks, feels and sounds incredible. the stories of the game are also very interesting and touch on things that make you pause, think about and maybe shed a tear. the characters in the game are great, they are from different backgrounds, with their own past and problems. they are also greatly dubbed and memorable, i really developed a relationship with some of them. same the music, it can evoke an action mega blast, tension and emotions. as for how the game is played, it is probably nothing special but it is comfortable to control and it is very diverse in what you can use as means of transport, weapons and hacking skills. i'm more for the atmosphere and immersion in the world and the story. if you like that stuff also, i can only recommend the game. it's a damn cool experience choomba! what's going on around the game is another matter. i enjoyed the game a lot but some people don't enjoy it the way they should. mainly the owners of the old gen console. even the pc version has problems and sometimes it can spoil the experience a bit in some situations. but that can be found in all games. for those who are not in rush, i might advise you to wait a while, because it really seems that some things in the game are unfinished. the developers plan to continue working on and improving the game, so it may be worth to wait some time and having the first experience in the best possible way. i will personally return to the game in a year to play it again and i am really curious how it will change in that time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"before going on, i am no prude, this game is very mature murder, kidnap, suicide and all manner of mutilations. if you are going through any personal trauma, it covers some heavy stuff, even before the visceral fight scenes and other adult themes. i spent an age playing this as a paper roleplaying game rpg. it came in a minimal black and white box with minimal instructions that set a bleak mood  in this world, you are meat in the grinder. one manner of mutilation or another was normal. i recall one brilliant bit of art in the manuals  a man staring at his own bionic arm. it did not seem that he was amazed that he had a bionic arm but as if he was pondering a coat of paint on it or chip on the casing. part of the game concept came across as giving up your humanity for the luxury of modernity  giving up your soul for the feeling of having it all at your fingertips. also that you aren't superhuman. characters were human, vulnerable and cunning. the firefight combat was initially lethal. it got diluted as add ons to the rpg went on  characters got more overpowered  but the cold lethality of fights particularly with guns and the reality of what happens was present. one solution to the violence in the cyberpunk mythos was signing up to trauma teams who swoop in to save clients. some games were even based around saving clients and drama spinning off what had got them minced in the first place. this was cold and brilliant. most rpgs are about fantasy quests. playing a character as member of a ambulance crew, security guard or corporate stiff  was unique. the setting was a shootier, techier version of what was in the current news at the time  a feeling that politics was failing, only money mattered and people even democratic states just are used one way or the other. to the computer game, the mood from the rpg is  at heart  spot on. you feel vulnerable for so many reasons surrounded and lost in the city. the level of detail and sense of being overwhelmed by all the gaudy and often lethal sights on the streets is phenomenal. the contrast also of when you leave the city to the nomad areas is stark. the regions of night city are brilliantly designed and distinctive. the visuals are backed up by a complex array of sound effects and a varied soundtrack of music from various sources. the gameplay for the main story line  as seems to be a thing since fallout 4  is pretty bland. i will leave it as a ticking clock scenario which never really ticks down. cant say more or ill ruin it. the side quests are peppered, however, with the most humorous and touching scenarios ive seen in any game. some of them really tug at the heart strings having profound consequences as well as padding out many of the characters you meet around you. this is the main strength of the game. the side stories run over the main story line and pick up to each other in imaginative ways. even if you go into this game as a shooter, i guarantee some of the side quests will make you think and touch you one way or the other. the quality of the story telling in the side quests really notable. however, the flaws in this game are equally staggering. i have the pc version  meant to be the rolls royce of the versions. it restarted when downloading  raising the download for the game to about 3 days, including the launch patch. the graphics glitched even when not dealing with big complex action scenes in incredible ways  these are well documented  but characters disappear, levitate, become naked, merge with furniture and continued to do so after the updates. i am up to speed with the downloads as of today. for a 50 game, it is pretty shameful and whatever high praise i have for this games story it is very poor state to release something so anticipated in  the company must have had a massive amount of preorders alone. for shame, cd projekt red. one other thing i have always been a bit weirded out by in computer games about is sex scenes. similar to this games stable mate the witcher series, you can get groovy digitally. i have often been uncomfortable with this as it seems gratuitous, but similar to the witcher, such trysts done with real thought. no spoilers, but i guarantee if you persist with the characters in this game you will fall in love at least one of them. perhaps even lust. i mention the last to nail home the strength of the characters spun in this game. it makes no sense that such a massive effort has gone into developing this aspect for it to have such massive technical issues. when it technically works the sneaking is as engaging as the combat, the setting is as notable as the set pieces in the game as it unfolds. but it is so sadly flawed by its functionality it lets itself down and cd projekt reds customers and fans of the cyberpunk mythos so badly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"open world games are meant to be that, open world. yet the things to do in this game are so stupid, uninteresting and unimportant i genuinily cant believe people consider this a masterpiece. ooohhh, but the story is what matters. well the story  balls, i dont wanna spoil anything but there is practically nothing interesting in this games story, the writing is laughable, the characters mostly  and the few exceptions dont save one dimensional characters like johnny, panam and v. but the gameplay, the gameplay. sure its fun, that is why i finished this game. but this game has to be one of the worst rpgs ever. rpg my brown ass, the few choices you make practically dont make any difference, why choose corpo, street kid or the other oneit is that forgettable when the outcome is litteraly the same. the other choices through the game dont impact too much in the games story. equiptment is kind of cool, but nothing i cared too much, where in other rpgs were a big deal. the weapons have great designs, the cars and other but the few changes you make too them dont really add with the open world and rpg aestethic. the shooting is fine, but what you shoot at is not, sayme looking guys, sayme playing guys and just boring enemies. this is a science fiction game and you have as much variety as gta san andreas. worst of all, the ai , they respond as effective as goldeneye ai. there are lots of playstyles, thats a positive. also there is a lots of  snipers, bombs and well it . the only times i died were one shot deads, cause the game appears to think that you are stupid enough too not use the innihalators or whataver too brute force the game. the game is just too easy. is quite sad cause the game looks awesome, speccialy with ray tracing, but visuals are soo much when the game feels so dead. so repetitve, so uninteresting, so boring. the story didnt made me feel anything, the characters were forgettable and the game is just that, forgettable. i could talk about bugs and things like that, but the game is fundamentally bad, so i dont care. i found some bugs, mostly car related. nothing too gamebreaking so thats that. i cant recommend almost nothing about this game, if you like shooty shooty and boring repetitve sayme looking guys, a story with explosions and thats about it, characters as depth as the girl from transformers, and a open world really flat with tedius go there and kill a enemy tipe missions, then this game might be for you. if you want world building, variety, multi layered characters, a science fiction world, with unique boss fights, build up, a multi choices story, interesting missions, and a open world to rival witcher 3 in its stuff to do, then you will be dissapointed. cant wait to forget this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"i played on a 3070 and r5 3600. it is beautiful, there are unforgettable moments in the game. i hope the rest will be fixed soon as this has a 1010 potential. after seeing all the endings including a secret one i bump the score to 9, even the bugs included. 10 if they fix all of the glitches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"it is obvious that all the positive reviews here are paid for by cd project red with the few money left aside i guess. this game is completely broken on pc i cannot imagine the situation on ps4xbox one. beside the enormous amount of bugscrashes that prevent you to complete missions v 1.1 there is a more structural problem the game is soulless interaction with npcs is not existent, they all look the same, cops spawn automatically when you commit a crime, dead bodies talking and much more i still look forward to discover. this stuff cannot be fixed with patches that by the way are not fixing even the rest to publish something like this should be consider a fraud and fortunately it is, good luck to everyone suing cd project red but fortunately in 2022 we will get some free dlcs to use in this unplayable game. recap the game is  whoever rated this 1010 should get support for mentally  people"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"game is generally speaking very good, but very flawed. i have really enjoyed the main story and some of side questlines. unfortunately all the side activities are very repetitive, and the gameplay itself is somehow boring. playing on ps4 pro was also a big test for my patience. the witcher 3 was a masterpiece. cyberpunk 2077 is still a very good game, but in my opinion it simply didn't live up to the expectations."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"this game has only two things that has going for it,characters and soundtrack.rest is pure  not the rpg as advertised,just another  even mentioning performance and bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-31,"premire chose, mon avis est donn aprs pas loin de 115h de jeu. je joue sur pc avec une config qui me permet de jouer en ultra. pour ceux que a intresse et qui voulait un avis sur le jeu tournant sur pc. agrablement surpris par rapport  ce que je lisais sur le jeu. j'ai eu peu de bug et ce n'tait que des bugs graphique. aucun bug qui m'a empch de jouer, aucun problme de plantage. en tout j'ai d voir au moins une vingtaine de gros bug graphique. ce qui je trouve reste en fin de compte assez frquent au lancement de ce genre de jeu rpg en ow. pour l'aspect technique j'ai pas vraiment eu de baisse de framerate, je tourne entre 5060fps, la plus forte baisse remarqu tait  43fps lors d'une grosse scne d'action. mais avec le rt a pompe un peu. sans rt a tourne tranquille mais dommage de s'en passer sur ce jeu. concernant le gameplay je savais pas trop quoi en penser. je suis pas un grand amateur du first person mais c'est style fps, je comprends ce choix et de plus il est vrai que le first person pour un rpg aide beaucoup pour l'immersion. le gameplay est plutt classique mais fait le boulot. ils auraient peut tre d amliorer le systme de piratage qui je trouve est un peu rat et sous exploiter. concernant la conduite qui a l'air de faire un peu polmique, effectivement c'est pas super, mais c'est pas non plus affreux, on arrive trs bien  conduire et a pose pas de problme d'aller  un point a  un point b. c'est pas le top mais c'est pas non plus une simu de conduite et j'ai connu pire comme dans les mafia qui m'a pourtant jamais empcher d'apprcier la saga. ensuite le sujet qui est le plus important dans ce genre de rpg, c'est l'histoire. et elle est vraiment trs bien. l'univers cyberpunk n'est pas un style qui m'attire spcialement mais l on se laisse embarquer dans ce monde en dcadence. les personnages principaux et mme secondaires sont vraiment bien crit et ont chacun un caractre propre et tu sais quand tu discutes avec eux quel genre de personnage il s'agit... fou, violent, tranquille, barjot, dcal, drle etc... et c'est quand mme assez dingue, je crois ne jamais avoir vu a dans un autre jeu avec autant de personnage si diffrent. l'ambiance elle, est vraiment particulire, tout est dans l'excs, que ce soit la violence, les rapports humain?, la technologie, la luxure etc... et c'est ce qui aide  l'immersion et permet aussi de dcouvrir un univers que l'on connait trs peu en jeu vido. le cyberpunk ne plaira pas  tout le monde. par moment il y a aussi des scnes vraiment drangeantes  ne pas montrer  tout le monde mme si a reste loin du gore. je rajouterai  cette ambiance la lumire qui est superbe. toutes ces couleurs, cette luminosit permanente qui aide  crer un monde qui ne dort jamais, toujours en activit... je reste bluffer par cette esthtique. et le ray tracing qui rend le tout incroyable. concernant la ville, elle est immense et mme aprs 20h de jeu j'avais toujours du mal  m'y retrouver. night city est trs grande est trs vivante. parfois tu peux passer plusieurs minute juste dans une rue,  flner ou aller dans des endroit pour leur ambiance, leur musique etc... les missions sont vraiment bien scnaris et les choix on une vrai consquences sur la suite. alors il faut bien faire attention  ce que l'on veut faire pour la suite et quel direction on veut faire prendre  notre personnage. les missions secondaires sont aussi bien crite, alors on arrive aussi, comme dans tout les rpg,  avoir des missions pas vraiment intressantes et qui servent juste  level up ou choper des objets etc... concernant le doublage, il est vraiment bien effectu. les acteurs font bien leur taff. je rajouterai un point pour la musique et les sons d'ambiance qui sont aussi vraiment bien. quoi qu'il en soit en rsum, le jeu est vraiment trs beau et je peux comprendre qu'il galre  tourner sur les consoles previous gen comme la ps4 et xbox. le jeu vous embarque dans son univers facilement. les personnages bien crit, etc... je ne prends pas en compte les bugs qui pour moi n'ont rien  faire dans la notation car ceux ci seront corrig au fur et  mesure. surtout qu'en plus il ne gne en rien la jouabilit. un trs bon jeu, peut tre pas le meilleur jeu de la dcennie mais au moins dans le top 10. ca reste que mon avis, mais il est objectif. c'est un trs bon jeu."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-30,"this is a review of 1.06 version graphics  810. a good looking game in general, however the graphics are not consistent everywhere. they often look average or straight up bad, especially during free roam outside of scripted missions. also, there is a lot of popup and plenty of situations where high quality model of an object doesn't manage to load in time when you approach it. animations are pretty stiff outside of scripted cutscenes. also lots of graphical glitches like tposing npcs, clipping, or animations freaking out. story  710, however it's very linear. your dialogue choices don't matter 99 of the time outside of few times when you get to decide the ending. characters are decent and keanu reeves character turned out pretty badass and convincing. his 3d model looks pretty disappointing though, especially considering he's the most important character and highlight of the game. i would expect better. user interface is all over the place. pretty confusing. the fact that you have plenty of junk to pick up on every step doesn't help. i ended up collecting everything and then selling stuff if i ended up overweight. i picked the best armor and weapon based on one statistic. didn't bother with modifications etc. didn't buy anything, just used random stuff that i picked up. and i completed the game easily. gunplay  average vehicle handling  bad. vehicles handle worse than watch dogs. much worse. physics  bad. they are 2005 tier. car crashes have no weight to them, like cars are made of rubber and the behavior is often ridiculous, like you crash into a car and you drive under it. and running over pedestrians feels like they are weightless. also it glitches out, pedestrians and objects often go inside your car and you drag them with you, ai  dumb. npcs have barely any ai. and enemies go straight under your gun. they also get stuck all the time and you can shoot them easily. and there are no police chases. it's not programmed. police just appears out of nowhere. world  city is decently sized however it looks basically the same everywhere you go. there is very little variety. pretty boring. i'm not a big fan of the art direction. and very little to do there. those who say that this is the biggest and most immersive and alive world in video games are straight up lying. it has literally nothing on games like gta, watch dogs or rdr2. pedestrian and car density is good enough, however since they have no ai they feel artificial and just there for decoration. also, pedestrian and car density drops to nearly zero when you drive a vehicle, but it goes back once you're on foot. overall, if you expect a detailed and immersive open world sandbox action game like gta, watch dogs or rdr, you will be very disappointed. and if you expect a detailed rpg where every choice you make matters, you will be disapointed as well. this game does bad in both. this game is a big disappointment considering it's budget, years in production and how much hype it generated. cdpr tried to throw down the gauntlet to rockstar and ubisoft, but they failed miserably. this game definitely doesn't deserve a score higher than 810, no matter how you look at it. the whole game feels plasticky, wonky and unpolishedunfinished if i had to describe it shortly. i personally gave it a 6 because i'm not a hyped cdpr fanboy and i see things as what they are. it was not a horrible experience, but far far away from a masterpiece. all 9 and 10 scores are ridiculous."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-29,"i am still in awe. not because this game is awesome, which it most definitely is, but because of all the unneeded negativity surrounding cyberpunk 2077. these days it's fun to game bash, especially when expectations don't coincide with reality. the witcher 3 was an amazing game, no doubt, but this cyberpunk 2077 was never suppose to be the witcher 4! this is an open world, retro futuristic, first person rpg that was designed and coded in just over two small years! red dead redemption 2 on the other hand, another open world with rpg elements, had a development cycle of 7 years! what the designers at cdpr have done in the time allotted to them is nothing short of amazing...bugs and all. let's talk about perfection for a second. it doesn't exist! flashback to 1997 a young boy is playing ocarina of time, his mouth is slack jawed, reeling from the three dimensional playground which is hyrule. he is running through a temple, the great deku tree and decided to fight a giant skeleton spider. his camera suddenly clips through his enemy and sees eternal blue... the eternal nothingness of outside the game. a second later the camera rights itself and he gets hit by his  no he gets knocked backwards and flies off the edge of a cliff and dies. still razzled from what just happened the young boy presses continue and starts again, dedicated to reaching the end. fast forward to cyberpunk 2077. the child is now a man with perspective. he has learned that nothing is perfect, yes he may clip through a wall, and yes, an enemy may materialize from nowhere and shank his ass. but this does not matter to him. experience has shown him that these things are nothing but motes of dust compared to the journey he is on. the beauty of night city surpasses the mild disturbance . the people he meets along the way, chalk full of personality, over shines the fact that any second a car may appear out of nowhere and run him over. it is my opinion that cyberpunk 2077 gives way more then it takes. the journey is fun and thoughtful and dark and above all worth it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-29,"unnecessary hype for a barebones shallow game. the game is a huge disappointment. pros  story is well written for the most part, but the cut portions are very obvious as you play the game.  characters are shockingly good. really wellwritten dialogues, very likeable.  the soundtrack bangs! really never expected the soundtrack to be so good. but feels more skrillex than cyberpunk.  the rpg systems are technically a good upgrade from the witcher 3.  night city if it works is a gorgeous place. the openworld geometry makes it even more better. the verticality is just amazing. the antisymmetrical geometry and engineering of the city structures is so good.  side missions are good, but forgettable.  gigs are serviceable.  keanu's voice acting is meh. cons oh boy! buckle up for this one!  the lies, the misleading marketing, the sweet fuking little lies!! why? edit the e3 2018 demo is fake.  25 promotionalmarketing videos, including 13 trailers btw you can check on yt is totally unacceptable for any product or hell, anything. night city wire. oh boy, is it the most atrocious way of marketing a game.  the lifepaths are very, very disappointing. they barely affect your gameplay. i went in thinking it would impact as how dragon age origins did. they give you an extra dialogue, which is nice but barely makes a difference in the overall narrative. you will go through a 1015 min brief prologue that's rushed and bridges into a montage and makes you a street kid.  some characters aren't fleshed out well. left me a bit to be desired.  the clothing in this game.. the less said, the better.  you cannot customize your character once you've done with it in the beginning of the game. there's no purpose of customizing v's gentiles. you cannot customize v's car, apartment. weapon customization could've been a thing in an fps game!!  the audio design is dog!t. maybe a bug in the ingame mixer, but its very bad!  night city is beautiful, but it has a disproportional amount of sex shops. the sexualized ads are overwhelming. just too much! and has the most uncomfortable sex scenes in a video game.  the openworld at times feels pointless. there's nothing to do. nothing innovative.  the branching narrative is total bs. its nonexistent. the game is linear asf.  the endings are not satisfying whatsoever.  the dialogue choices are also stupid and useless. they are as shallow as call of duty black ops cold war's. you'll have like 1. yes 2. yesser 3. yessest 4. street kid hell yeah! 5. corpo yessir. 6. nomad. ohhyahh!!  the perks are very uninspired. just percentage boosters. here's a perk that gives 5 of more quicker erection!  the ingame economy is a joke. there's no resale value at all for ingame items.  the npc and police ai is nonexistent. this was a problem in the witcher 3, but its more prevalent in cyberpunk 2077. the routine npc ai and corrupt police is all lies. the ai is not even up to xbox 360ps3's standards.  no variety in enemy types.  the loot is nonsense. it's as bad as the witcher 3. wtf am i supposed to do by looting ashtray or a used condom cover.  the vehicle physics are bad.  the gunplay is a chore in the initial part of the game. as you acquire perks, it will be better. it would feel like almost you have played two different games, and that's not how it should work. the weapon sandbox can be both good and stupid. melee weapons is a joke! except the mantis blades  the game is buggy asf! it ranges from funny small bugs to game breaking ones. its also an unoptimized mess. my pc not the latest and the greatest could hold it up to 3050 fps on 1080p medhigh. the game has a lot of draw distancing and level of detail issues. the game is on lifesupport thanks to dlss. but, if you own a gtx card, good luck getting the game onabove 60 fps. all in all, cyberpunk 2077 is sure as hell not a bad game, but not a good game either. the todd howard level lies just made it worse. this game wants to be everything, a grand theft autostyle openworld, a fallout style fps, mass effect style dialogue choices, a witcher 3 style branching narrative, a borderlands 2 style loot, a ubisoft game style filler side missions, a dragon age origins style lifepaths, and that's just not possible. in try to do the best game, cdpr has failed in doing the fundamentals that aren't up to ps2's standards. the fact that the demo turned out to be fake, really hurts. unfortunately, the game feels like a poor man's, watered down version of far cry than any of the games mentioned above. i'd give it a 6.510. i'd strongly not recommend to buy this game right now! let the game get its patching work done. it very much feels like an early access game, only its without the early access indication on the store page. wait and patiently wait. there are really good games out there to try in the mean time. check out deus ex human revolution"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-28,"i understand why people want to rate it lower as the game has its bugs and other issues. here's why i'm giving this game a 9 star citizen this is not! you can definitely see how much work was put into created both the amazing looking world, as well as crafting an exciting and meaningful story that i love. the problem is 1 obviously all of the bugs, and 2 a lot of the world can feel like set dressing as there is not a lot of interactivity with the random things around the world. that being said, this game is truly an unpolished gem. the ground work for everything amazing is all right here. what the game truly needed was another 68 months of development to clear out the bugs, and add a little bit more interactiveness with npcs. for example i see a ramen shop. i want something to do at said ramen shop. even showing me eating ramen after a purchase would suffice. all of these are things that will likely be added when the game is ready. unfortunately, the game was released unready. and that is why i can't give it a 10. i emphasize this game is truly amazing, it is just unfinished. it is not like star citizen that has been  money and delivering nothing but glorified tech demos for 10 years. this game has delivered something that will be complete and will blow everyone away... assuming that the company is not sued into bankruptcy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-28,i played it for 60 hours and still i didn't get bored of it one of the biggest games and have a lot of choices there are a ton of things you can do and glitches are getting more rare after the last update believe me try the game and don't listen to the people talk especially if you like rpg games in my opinion i think it's a mix of fallout and gta so if you like those games i really recommend it for you and don't forget to use cyberware items because it's one of the most fun things to do  i played it on pc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-28,"disappointing. none of the choices actually matter, broke rpg elements and skill tree, lifepath doesn't mean a thingit doesn't change anything in the game, just an illusion of backstory, only one enemy type and one solution to kill enemies which is shooting, and you probably heard about the bugs too so i don't need to mention"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-28,"a masterpiece is defined, in my view, by the amalgamation of form and content. cyberpunk 2077 presents a good story and a complex plot, with juicy references to the cyberpunk universe, but bugs and glitches continuously and irreparably damage that intention. good intention, bad execution, a lot of marketing and presales for a product that was not and will not be for some time ready to be presented. a good opportunity lost."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,this game is ok. the game is extremely linear. all the choices feel like they have no impact at all.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"obviously cp77 suffered a horrendous launch on all platforms, and that should be admonished in its own right, but this review is happening after the late january 2021 update, and cd projekt red has made strides to improve stability, fix bugs, and so on. graphically, the game is a mixed bag. on xbox one and playstation 4, the game looks like an xbox 360 and playstation 3 game. the developer very poorly optimized the game for launch on last generation's consoles, despite those consoles being the current generation for the vast majority of the game's development. on pc, the game looks good with up to date hardware, but not nearly as good as promised in trailers and promotional material. night city does not feel as alive and detailed as it did in the high production value trailers and gameplay reveals. draw and rendering distances ranged from average at best top of the line pc hardware to comically abysmal at worst ps4. crashing is abundant on ps4 and xb1, and only occasional on pc. on ps4 and xb1, you can pretty much set a two hour timer and wait for the game to crash. this issue was not fixed or improved upon in any of the patches. combat on all three platforms feels floaty. on pc, i messed with my sensitivity settings a little, tweaking as i went until i found a sweet spot. on console, i messed with the sensitivity settings a lot, and course corrected a frustrating amount of times until i found a tolerable level of float that i could get used to. stealth is fine, and probably more polished than the combat, which is unfortunate considering how infrequently it is a viable option. taking out a base of goons in stealth can take so long, that i got bored more often than not and revealed myself on purpose to start a firefight. quickhacking is interesting, but not very refined. you'll end up sticking to the same three or four quickhacks for every scenario. it's more gimmick than revolutionary feature. melee combat is so janky, and overall bad. a lot of hits you thought landed, didn't. some enemies have unexplainable resistances to melee combat, and it bugs out far more frequently than ranged. crafting is so utterly terrible and not worth your investment even for a second. collecting parts is a nightmarishly tedious task, and you have to commit a lot of skill points to crafting in order to create anything worthwhile. even if you do make a great weapon, chances are you can find a better one in about 20 minutes while out on side missions. cd projekt red kept the same boring tedious mechanics for crafting from their witcher series, and it did not age well at all. driving is a non starter. there are very few cars that feel good to drive, and the physics of the game were not built in tandem with the geography of the map in a way to allow players to drive fast without flying around the streets wildly and launching themselves unexpectedly. either night city does not have standard earth gravity, or the cars of 2077 only weigh 100 pounds. i can think of at least a dozen games off the top of my head that had more comfortable driving mechanics. choicemaking and dialogue trees are pretty good. choices feel like they have a lot of weight, and pay off in interesting ways. the writing of cp77 really saves this game. the plot is interesting, perfectly paced, and tense in all the right places. the romance options feel very dumbed down, and v's choices are horribly and disappointingly few, but the ones included in the game are written pretty well, and can all have satisfying endings. keanu reeves is average to slightly above average throughout most of the game, and downright brilliant in some spots. overall pretty good performance for someone new to performance capture acting. was he the perfect casting choice? yes and no, somehow. you can't go wrong with keanu, but maybe someone else could have done better. the music in cp77 is varied, well produced, and high quality overall. if you have an eclectic taste in music, you'll love the cp77 radio. overall, cyberpunk 2077 is just okay. the amazing story props up the dated and underwhelming gameplay and crashing issues. bugs make the game annoying to play, but again, the meticulously detailed and thoughtful plot can keep you quitting to the main menu, and loading back in. i have finished four playthroughs of this game, on all available platforms, on updated hardware."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"this game runs amazing on my pc, and what's more the acting, quests and story are absolutely incredible. i had so much fun i restarted immediately after i finished."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"this game failed to deliver, it is not what cd projekt red led us to believe it would be. life paths have no meaningful impact on the game, they add flavour dialog and a couple of unique quests and do not majorly alter the game as was promised. dialog choices are more illusion than anything as they lead to the same outcome. the ai is bare bones, in combat enemies will just sit there while you take your sweet time head shooting them, police spawn out of the thin air and don't react to gun fire from gangs shooting over their heads. theirss no police car chases either. no bounty hunters, maxtac coming after you. they simply can't chase you in vehicles and have you noticed there are no other bikes on the road only in scripted events. crafting is imbalanced and unrewarding. you can craft clothing mods from basic components and disassemble them into more advanced components. somehow you can disassemble consumables like soda drinks and craft high tech weapons from them which makes zero sense. upgrading weapons only offer a small increase in damage and becomes ridiculously expensive. when upgrading legendary weapons you use very expense components for an extra 10 points of damage etc. this feature was meant to allow the player to keep their favourite guns but is not even remotely balanced for this. hacking is overpowered which is not helped by the dumb ai and the minigame itself becomes very tedious. the perk tree is all over the place. some give 50 extra headshot damage while others give 3 extra damage. a lot of the icons don't match what the perk provides. it is full of padding. one perk disassembles valuable junk together with the common junk costing the player 1000's in money. skills should add interesting mechanics and abilities. driving is a mess, the pov when driving first person is messed up on a lot of cars you can barely see over the steering wheel. breaking is almost none existent. some time you are blinded by daylight when driving first person, this is more common in the badlands. the arm augmentations which where advertised as game changing like gorilla arms allowing you force open doors is no longer a feature though the item description is still there. inventory is a nightmare to organise. it would have made more sense to find the gun with a standard skin and allow the player customise it ourselves. levelled guns and armour means you are constantly changing guns i think i spent most of my time going through my inventory. late game rare and epic guns drop all the time which makes them feel common and not like epic loot. bugs everywhere, tposing pedestrians, car drivers, in cut scenes etc. floating cigarettes, guns, frame rate drops. cars driving through wall, sliding nps in cutscenes. dead still talking to the player, dying when jumping down 4 feet, dropping off the top of ladders. grenades not been thrown when pressing the button. i could go on but the main thing is this game is not what cd projekt red promised and is an average game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"i bought it for the 3 main platforms, pc, ps4 and xbox1 have the x and the pro, because of the promise of next gen update and sharing the accounts with my brothers, pc to play it today well the other two for when the next gen drop etc the disappointment of the decade it is the worst con the gaming industry produced yet, they even in 2019 relabeled it actionadventure and was for 7 years promoted as an rpg comparable to witcher 3... watch videos about how bad is it before even thinking buying it used."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"long list of bugs aside, the game is incomplete and just bad. the first few story missions are pretty good, then they just stopped trying. the voice acting, particularly johnny silverhand, is atrocious. the combat is boring and way too easy, even on the hardest difficulty setting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"i played a lot of games in my life, always saw people complaining about bugs but never care too much about it. i'm always focused on the gameplay and how much fun the game is, if there are some bugs that's ok i can live with that. but the case with cyberpunk is different because there are so many bugs that have impacts on gameplay that it ruin your immersion in the game. for example, yesterday i was playing it and part of the character's body appears in front of me. that is big trouble in an fps game just so you know the bug was so bizarre that it messes up my aiming. for me, the only thing that is perfect in this game is the graphics if you play on a highend pc. but the game is poorly optimized so if you don't have a really good pc you should wait for the devs to fix the game. i expected so much more from cdpr but is clear that they had big ambitions for this game and they lost themselves trying to deploy their ideas. for me, the only thing that is perfect in this game is the graphics if you play on a highend pc. but the game is poor optimized so if you don't have a really good pc you should wait the devs fix the game. i expected so much more from cdpr but is clear that they had big ambitions for this game and they lost themselves traying to deplay their ideas. for me the only thing that is perfect in this game is the graphics if you play in a high end pc. but the game is really poor optimizaded"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"apart from bugs and poor optimization though was it poor if it ran at 4045 fps average at middlehigh graphics on my nvidia 1060 3gb? anyway i have nothing more to criticize. bad ai perhaps, but the architecture, main characters, whole atmosphere of the city... it was astounding. i won't say anything about the story though, because it can be perceived and understood in various different manners, but i was kinda even more than satisfied with it. the game overall gave a very refreshing feeling i have no regrets for having preordered it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"love this game! pc release. never crashed on me. i have a 2070 super and a 10th gen pentium i7. i have over 200 hours into the game, and have done two playthroughs. totally worth the money. compare this to avengers, same price, crashed constantly, fr lagged for months, and there was no endgame at launch"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"this game is the game of the year for me, even though it has a lot of bugs and glitches. it has great characters like judy, johnny or panam and of course a lot of others are great too. i've recorded over 250 hours and i'm still enjoying the game. i've found enough bugs at times, but it's not as bad as it seems. it is a such shame that they removed the content which in that game was supposed to be like a metro, but i believe that it may come within a year. this one is like no man's sky but at least with some content. no mans sky is a good game now and the developers have done what they didn't follow so i don't see why it couldn't be with cyberpunk"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,"prepurchased it on pc and played for 3hours, not quite as engaging as the hype we all had. i will eventually play again in a few months after the big patches to see if it has improved."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-27,even with the patches the game is missing so much content that was promised in the trailers the entire game is basically go here shoot guys repeat the open world is empty as  anyone who says id give it a 9 if they fixed the game is a ing liar the game is unfixable it not fun no matter how many patches and dlc they add
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"positive story  visuals cons bad ai bad gameplay bad animations bad item system horrific melee combat bad level scaling and balancing on the game horrible car system and cars in general. content missing compared to marketing material if you are looking for something innovative, you wont find it here."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"ai straight from 2003, basic features that are just missing for instance water animations of any kind, cut content everywhere, basically no ai at all for police .. they just act like normal gang members and cannot even chase you, instead they teleport behind you out of nowhere, borderline bad looting  crafting system .. and these are just a few, not sure if they're able to fix this mess , there is just so much wrong with it and im talking about core game mechanics"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"i had to reset my password to make this review. i played the game for more than 80 hours, and i am on my second playthrough, and i have to say, this is the most disappointing game i have ever played, of course this was never going to deliver on the hype, not even half life 3 had this level of hype. i played this on pc and it was a bugfest, a game that clearly needed like 6 more months to be completed, but leaving the bugs aside i can say this is a mediocre title. story wise is good, a short but really cool campaign. if you are playing this just for the story then yes you will enjoy it, but you have to ignore the terrible mediocre game behind it. this was advertised as next level rpg, and that is a lie, there is a skill three that honestly feels like an afterthought, the game doesn't even let you customize the character looks after you have created it, you cant even get a haircut or modify your body aesthetics, the ripperdocs allow you to get some basic upgrades but they are very generic and nothing impactful. the life paths are a joke, other than a different starting area and like a single exclusive mission, you play the exact same person weather you choose corpo, nomad or streetkid. the leveling feels like you are just unlocking boring passive points that have impact but you cant feel it as they don't change the game mechanics. the loot system is ok, guns feel really nice when you shoot and the gun combat is ok, but broken, almost anything can one shot. there is a certain type of weapon were you can shoot through walls and that is just plain stupid, enemies can't see you, but you can see them, and all you have to do is shoot behind cover to kill them. katanas and melee weapons feel ok, they can be fun but the melee combat is horrible, those missions were you have to fight other npcs are boring and nothing like in the witcher 3. loot feels generic, a lot of trash and most things you pick will end up being salvaged for materials that you will later use for the crafting system, and the crafting system is so basic that i don't know why it's included, you can't customize your guns other than a silencer or an scope, some mods and that's it, we definitely expected way more. legendary weapons are really fun but make the game so much easier, but the thing i dislike the most about this game is the open world, it's filled with fetch quests, repetitive missions to increase your street credit to unlock more repetitive missions, go here, kill some people, grab a laptop, hack a system, all very much the same, making money in this game is really easy as well as the economy is completely broken. the world feels huge, and really beautiful but also dead, it's like walking on a city filled with brainless bots, there are no bars to do cool things, no arcade games or other fun activities that don't involve combat. i expected to breath night city, to see npcs reacting to me, but they all feel the same, they behave like a bunch of cowards when you shoot, and if you follow one of them they are just following a circular path just pretending to do something to create the illusion of a crowd and the police, it's so bad that they spawn anywhere if you shoot a civilian or comit a crime, they spawn, and all you have to do to loose them is walk a bit or grab a car and run away, they don't chase you, its so bare bones that you can tell they rushed this system. this is a mediocre game in all aspects other than the story, the graphics are nice, but nothing impressive, i feel like cdpr had a fantastic concept but the scope of it was too big for their team and it's a real shame because i know that this could have been a fantastic game. in 6 months this will be a more polished game, but the current systems, the current ai, the current dead aura of the city will not be fixed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"one of the best games in recent years. technically there were some issues but it really doesn't matter after what is served with story, characters, graphics and music. voice actors polish version are phenomenal! have 60 hours  and really can't stop playing, even witcher 3 haven't  me in so hard."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"cyberpunk is not a bad game despite all its flaws. the reason i open with that is simple, most of these reviews seemingly are from people angry that a game they like perhaps invested a lot of time in has been essentially deadpanned. i understand a user review is mostly anecdotal and may vary from person to person but theres a few universal factors that come into play. i heard of this game in april 2020, because of the delay i imagine people were upset and that caused it to actually become more popular, prior to that i never heard of the game even though ive played the witcher 3 also in 2020, obviously i was late to the hype train. many users and reviewers say promises were made and what was delivered was not remotely on par with what was expected, thats fine but i cant really speak from that perspective. purely from an open world rpg pov the game itself is not by any means terrible, the character design and lack of customization after creating your character like getting a haircut or a shave, or even growing facial hair ala red dead 2 or the witcher 3 is missing or was never considered, i knocked off some points for this. i played the corporate and nomad play styles, im hesitant to call them lifestyles primarily due to the lack of choices that are centered around these paths after act 1. theres a few choices that come up in dialogue that are unique to ones chosen path, rare but still here and there. i did not personally notice if these are of consequence or otherwise. the main story is very detailed and seems to be fleshed out. i liked the interactions with jackie and many of the side quests. the voice acting is hit or miss. youll notice a few hiccups during missions with calls coming in and unable to be ignored during conversations clothing seems to go back to the same customization cluster issue, you may end up dressed pretty goofily if you dont invest a lot of time in finding legendary clothing items that both look good and rank high. my character was dressed like a modern amalgamation of samurai and biker, mostly for the perks and no it wasnt appealing. the entire rp element is hollow, not much substance aside from the base i did not experience any of the major bugs and this likely due to my hardware and i wouldnt really knock any points off even if i did as those can be smoothed out over time replayability here is where the game suffers majorly, theres only a few paths one can take before the end of the story, and the end plot offers about 3 to 4 choices and having played them all i can say i havent even touched this game in about 3 to 4 weeks. i will go back to it when they add more substance, like better npc dialogue, car chases that work outside of the intro, a policewanted system that isnt just a minor inconvenience until youve left the area, the world itself feels hollow even more so than a game that 8 years old gtav let alone a masterpiece like red dead 2 get this game and try it yourself wait for a sale. dont go off hype, or hate. make your own opinion based on how much you enjoyed it or vice versa. clamoring hate on a company isnt going to make you feel better or make the game more to your liking, itll likely make that company less willing to take chances. no one forces you to buy anything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"is simple awful, graphics are good but thats all, nothin more especial than good looking graphics, gameplay is bad, story is littlebit confusing, not even close to be a memoreable history, and nothing more to say, is not a complete fiasco, but is close too, i mean is just a regular game for me."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-26,"cyberpunk 2077 is not a bad game, but a missed opportunity. like many people have mentioned, the lunch of this game did not go well and the game had many bugs and glitches. however, the major pullback was the cut content of the game and missed potential. pros  outstanding graphics if your machine can handle it.  side quests carry the game.  music is phenomenal.  story is good aside from cut content.  stellar performance by the cast. cons  game breaking bugs which effects the immersion and gameplay of the game.  badly optimized.  needs quality of life improvements on mini map, etc.  most of all, the cut content. this includes the obviously cut content regarding the story in the beginning, which could have had more impact on later on. without spoiling anything.  the world can feel empty at times, with npc's feeling soulless and badly programmed. verdict  610, as of now i do not recommend buying the game unless you have a good enough pc to handle it. if you do, buy at sale."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,one of the best game i i have ever play. cp gives me a lot of fun and makes me cry at the end...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"fantastic story, it really takes your into night city. the amount of choice and room for discretion is one of the selling points. had a rocky start and still has lots of issues, but if you're a fan of open world rpgs i highly reccommend. so ironically enough, despite what the public has said, i experienced little to no bugs with this breathtaking game! it is truly a masterpiece and i would highly suggest anyone get lost in this vast openworld game. and i'm waiting for a big update patch officially announced by the developer!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"graphics really good , for me to play i need to use some mods , but when it came to side quest , it also good , so i guess by taking a blind look at the bugs  all the tech issue ill give this game 410 just for the story and graphic itself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"this game has more features even in unfinished old games, it should be banned from sale, not for  60"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"i enjoyed the game but, even playing on hard, after the first 20 of the game combat was just too easy. i appreciate they different ways you can spec a character, but after i found hand guns was too easy i switched to quick hacking and that was even worse. replayability would have been better if more content was locked out based on your chosen skill tree."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"i really wanted to like this. i played it, nearly finished it but then i stopped, wanted to wait for some updates. but after update 1.1 i'm going to give this game a negative review. you cut loads of content. you presented us a fake e3 gameplay in 2018. i was thinking that maybe you'll fix stuff somehow but now you're introducing game breaking bugs with your patches aka hotfixes? nah, game over, you lost one loyal client here. my fav game is the witcher 3 wild hunt, i can't believe that the same company worked on this. this is just bad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"so many fanboys or just plain dumb people that want to defend their investment and preorder. it is painful to see such hypocrisy when not long ago people were all hating on bethesda for fallout 76 which actually was playable and was interesting and you could do a lot more than in this dead uninteractable world. everything is closed, no choices matter period. i mean i could go into depth and say how stupid and blind most fanboys are since witcher 3, but what's the point. people won't read this and they will downvote this cause i am basically canceling their prized possession which was available for free to pirate day 0. even in the witcher they all made a lot of fuss about choices mattering. did they? no. you marry triss or shani and then in the second game you're with triss regardless. then you dump them both and run after yen. the main difference is that the witcher was not an impossible game, they had the story and they had the characters. they wasted a lot and made one single story rather than maybe 3 different whole stories as they should because they sold out for consoles, like they did now also. they are not the good guy they are just a money hungry company that sold well and had a good product. hurr durr 19 free dlc yea most of them were one single costume or something of the sort. also i feel like later patches ruined or broke the game, they turned the dlc bosses into  souls like bosses regardless of the fact that you were super strong already. now for cyberpunk. if you do not have a 20 or 30 series gpu you get 4 times less fps for no real reason. maybe just because the company made deals with gpu sellers to do this on purpose since the game was so overrated and marketized. even keanu sold out for this pile of crap, i am so deeply disappointed. hopefully he had no idea how bad the game really is. now unlike most games or fallout 76 where many bugs were man made, probably used cheat engine to break the game and then post videos for likes and renown, in cyberpunk literally from the first second 56 patches into it!!!! you see all those bugs. characters don't react, drivers don't react. 10 year old games or more like gta vice city had better ai. not just that, let's say they didn't want that. the bugs where cars just explode or run into walls and such, i saw that myself. i wasn't even driving, i didn't do anything, i just ran to another location, i go to the street and i see explosions and fences broken and rubble into the air. so basically a 2080ti is 40 at the very most better than a 1080ti. unless it's cyber. then you are looking at a 300 performance gain. from unplayable 11 fps at max settings, to a 45 playable fps. if that doesn't tell you that the devs don't give a  and hate players or want you to spend tons of money on overpriced gpus right now, i don't know what is. it wouldn't surprise me if they owned a store for pc parts honestly, it's a gold mine for morons that think this game is good or even want to try it. characters are bland. game is bland. design is bland. the skills and attributes are horrible. game is not an rpg, it's an action story game made for consoles. i've seen more interaction and open world in worse games. everything is closed, nothing you do matters. i don't think this game can be saved like at all. fallout 76 doesn't crash for a long long time, has decent stuff in it but the game kinda died because of all the negativity around it. no man's sky was as predicted by me, a flop and a lie like cyberpunk but people claim they worked on it i would too if i would still sell the game at full price and already made tons of money on it and it's okayish. but this one? i doubt it. i doubt they would have the time and patience to personally modify every building and every place to be unique and interactable as they promised. it's disgusting how the devs were laughing and lying to our faces, just like the nms guy. at least todd did it once, said it was 16 times the detail bla bla bla. and then that was it. shameful that the playerbase actually like this and recommend this considering how bad it is, just shows how deluded or defensive of their purchase they are. honestly the game is so boring and bland i didn't even have the patience to play it that long. it's just horrible. you can't even just kill someone who has a bounty on their head and loot them for goodies like any normal good rpg. they drop  loot and you die in 2 seconds cause someone 500m away is shooting you apparently or cops teleport behind you. horrible game. glad i didn't have cdpr in my top 3 companies, now they will never make it there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"todo bugado, mal renderizado, um dos jogos que eu mais esperei foi um desastre"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"cyberpunk 2077 es probablemente el mejor juego de rol al que he jugado en mi vida, y sin duda llevo muchsimos. pero es importante tener eso en cuenta para no equivocarse de expectativas es un juego de rol de mundo abierto, como skyrim o the witcher 3. no es comparable ni del mismo gnero a gta v, rdr2, assassin's creed, etc. por mucho que esos sean mundos abiertos no son juegos de rol. aqu vais a encontrar una historia brutal, con escenas realmente impactantes que invitan a la reflexin sobre su mundo y el nuestro, personajes memorables, decisiones complicadas, una ambientacin cuidadsima... adems de progresin de personaje, subida de niveles, equipo con diversidad de stats, opciones de sigilo, combate cuerpo a cuerpo, a distancia, etc. no es el mejor juego de disparos ni el mejor juego de sigilo, pero si es el mejor juego de rol con todo lo que ello implica. hay algunos apartados a mejorar en este sentido, sin duda, especialmente la ia y lo relativo al control de vehculos, pero son cosas que estn puliendo y mejorando parche a parche. grficamente el juego es una maravilla. no solo en su espectacular ejecucin, sino en el diseo de toda la ambientacin, los personajes, las calles, etc. realmente night city se vuelve uno de los personajes principales del juego aunque sea una simple ciudad. y sin duda, mucho ms variada en sus espacios y recorridos que otras ciudades de otros juegos, teniendo desde los desiertos exteriores a los muelles, rascacielos, etc. el sonido no se le queda atrs, con una banda sonora muy potente y variada, efectos sonoros muy bien trabajados y voces de gran nivel. sin duda, hay que hablar de los bugs, porque los tiene. probablemente nunca debi salir en consolas, pero sin duda eso a mi no me preocupa, ya era hora de que ellos tuviesen una versin peor porque el juego se hiciese principalmente para pc y no al reves como ha ocurrido innumerables veces batman arkham knight por ejemplo, u outer worlds. la mayor parte de bugs que me he encontrado en ms de 100 horas fueron durante las primeras semanas, cuando si que es cierto que me sali un par de veces a escritorio como cosa ms grave, y que en alguna ocasin tuve que cargar la ultima partida guardada. pero la inmensa mayora de bugs son cosas poco importantes como objetos que no se pueden interactuar, o fsicas que funcionan mal en un momento, sin duda hemos visto lanzamientos mucho peores y menos jugables batman, de nuevo te miro a ti, pero no solo, me he quedado sin poder terminar el call of cthulhu porque literalmente colgaba mi ordenador entero cada periodo aleatorio de tiempo. por ello, sinceramente, creo que lo de los bugs est muy exagerado y no es grave ni rompe la inmersin ni nada. el resultado de todo ello es probablemente, como deca al principio, el mejor juego de rol que se ha hecho, y uno de los que trata temas adultos de la forma ms dura, profunda y cruda que he visto, con escenas realmente impactantes sobre temas como la explotacin sexual, los abusos corporativos o las pelculas snuff. y aquellos aspectos que merecen ser pulidos, lo estn siendo a pasos rpidos y eficaces. as que, para mi, es simplemente un 10, un juego capaz de invitar a la reflexin, emocionar y muchas cosas ms. para un comentario ms social sobre los temas que trata el juego y el modo en que invita a la reflexin sobre el mundo en el que vivimos cyberpunk2077"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"runs poorly even on the best machines, and even when it runs well the game is still dissapointing deus ex from 5 years ago is better in every way"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"this is one of the best games i ever played. apart form the minor glitches not annoying , just funny it is absolutely engaging every player. i love this open world quests which might pop up in the middle of doing another mission. another great thing is related to fact, that all my friends have different experience another way to resolve the missions and all of them right."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"as someone has said before, this game is an empty shell. there are elements here and there that are good, but there is too few things to do in the world except short and easily handled side jobs. meaningful and interesting side quests are few. the game world doesn't feel alive. some characters in the game are good and the atmosphere is nice too. i like thee lvl system and the way the game looks. these things hints at what the game could have been. the way that cdpr have acted to promote the game and flat out lied to potential customers and shareholders should be acted upon  which, thankfully seems to be happening. all this is too bad. we needed that cdpr that gave us the immortal witcher 3 game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"i'm suffering from big time buyer's remorse. putting the bugs aside which will be fixed eventually, the game is not what was marketed. after the stupidly short main story is completed, there is nothing much to do other than drive around to markers all over the map, get down, shoot, loot and drive again. this game tries to be gtav but it certainly is no gtav. made by the creators of tw3 but it nothing compared to tw3. how the hell the early reviewers gave this game raving reviews is beyond me. save your money and wait until until the devs beef the game up with content. my biggest regret is not refunding the game and instead telling myself to power through the boring content as it will get better. it does not. it is overhyped, overmarketed and underdelivered."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-25,"positive this game has a good story and, if you have the right hardware, good graphics. negative the a.i. is a joke, i have seen better a.i. 20 years ago the gunplay is not fun the melee combat is even less fun this rpg feels most of the time more like a loot shooter, but not a good one, the balance is horrible most of the wearable clothes look like made for circus clowns the physics are the most laughable thing i've ever seen in a videogame, motorbikes stick to your ass like glue, the water does not move when hit, car collision is the strangest thing i've ever seen in a videogame and so on the world is empty and unfinished, in some places you can get in some buildings which got no interior and you most likely will fall under the map driving over all in this game is bad the skilltree is maybe the worst skilltree i've ever seen in a videogame the summary is a game which is no real rpg, more like a crippled mix between a looter shooter and grand theft auto, but it does both things awful. so basically you have a good story in a, most of the time, nice looking city. the gameplay is at best mediocre, but most of the time simply bad. this game is unfinished, and you can see that on every corner of the world, the bugs are the smallest problem for this game, there is so much more wrong with this game. and it is once more proof that you can not trust gaming journalism anymore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"actually, it would be a 9.5 out of 10. the design concept behind it, namely a blade runnergtafallout, is fantastic. the many bugs and some not good design decisions unfortunately destroy the brilliant idea behind it. it is still a lot of fun and very enjoyable. but it could be the game of the decade. unfortunately, it lacked perfection and polish.... finally, every rating above and below 8 is either from hypers or from haters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"this game should not have been released in the state that it was. its just not up to standard even without the hype train. the bugs, abysmall ai and general feeling of incompleteness in all aspects of the game is just too prevalent to ignore. ruins the entire experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"this game has lots of bugs, and its no joke. but the world is rich with detail and the story is terrific. worth putting up with the bugs now, will be pleasure to play through again in the future when bugs get resolved along with new content."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"thank for this unfinished product and lie ads cdpr. it is my first time on metacritic and i am only here for this review. i don't wanna waste my energy for you, thank you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"honestly just a shell . some of the most poorly coded texture streaming in existence. buggy, glitchy, broken, boring and most importantly uninspired. please play witcher 3 as it is beautiful art in comparison to this hot pile of garbage. i paid 80 dollars for this and have never been so disappointed with a purchase. i doubt i will ever play this game again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"50 hours in and can say its not as buggy on pc as everybody says, its looks more like ps4 launch ruined everyones perception of the game. other than that, if we compares to others glitchy games like fallout, for example, we can easily say that we can have awesome games with faulty and flaw design, because the plot, graphics and game aesthetics is amazing but i agree that gameplay mechanics feels like a shooter but its not, more like a rpg but its not, vehicles clunky mechanics... anyways... good game, not masterpiece but def not as bad as people and media says. cdpr made a great advertising campaign and now it looks like media in general is making the same campaign on ruining the game and the company."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"after 63 hours of playing, i think this game is a masterpiece, maybe it didn't overcome previous cdprojekt game the witcher 3, but this game has his own recipe for being a great game. cyberpunk has an amazing narrative, characters, music, enviroment and gameplay despite the bugs every game has bugs and to be fair i didn't have that much bugs as people says. the narrative is amazing, it has interestings plow twist since the first hours of gaming. the enviroment, begin spoiler the city itself gives you steps about your possible fate end of spoiler. all the characters i met are amazing, you enjoy speding time with them and also you can get a relationship with some of them if you want. you really want to be in continue comunication with them and spend time with them. begin spoiler i will never forget takemura, claire, panam, judy, evelyn parker, river, peralez and so on, specially jackie of course. jhonny silverhand is an amazing character, both together v and him learn how to get along and together fight for saving v and silverhand ideal or not depending of what you decide. end of spoiler. every mision primary and secondary ones are amazing, they had their own story and gives you an idea of how people society lives on 2077, how it changed since nowadays and how other things didn't change, but evolved to be better or worse for humanity. the enviroment and mechanics are amazing, you can really feel like you're in a strange cyberpunk future with high buildings, cyborg people, amazing futuristic cars and weapons that combines katana and body parts to defeat enemies, new addictions and mental problems caused by robotics parts or informatic viruses and much rock nd roll. it's important to highlight the oriental culture that involves the city since it feels like it shaped the society, corporation and technology the music is amazing, it perfectly sets the enviroment pure rock, you will know why when you play the game. i like the freedom the game gives you. it let you to be yourself from the begining, to let you start the game as you want and to have the fate you deserve according to your decisions. to conclude, the game feels like a dark rock party where human freedom can be expressed in their body changes with electronics parts and their sexuality, but freedom is still questionable against human nature, mental behavior and peace. final score 1010. not a perfect game, but it has the formula to be a game of 10 score. i want to add that it's not fair to compare with gta5, specially 'cause is not the same franchise companies may differ on mechanic and logics for their games and if you want more things to do as many people suggest it actually is but as second missions with different activities. if that's it's the case, i prefer cyberpunk over gta5 since it has better main and secondary missions and the enviroment is much superior. also, i just don't like gta5 sarcastic history, it really differs against previous gta games. things that could be better some random npcs dialogs could be improved and maybe some activities could be added like using the arcade machines or adding eating animation if you're not in a mission, i hope so in future patchs."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"i really wanted to like this game, it fails on every single aspect and is an affront to all gamers. how is it possible that cdpr have fallen so low? corporate greed, that's why. no story, broken game mechanics, the title is a mess. i spent 150 hours bravely going though the plot and hours of boring grind but in the end i was left with the feeling of emptiness and disappointment. the game doesn't deliver at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"big  with good history and ambientation. the game, the estructure, is a literaly  there are no driving ia, a npc ia similar to a 1990 game, the city is empty, there are nothing to do, nothing to explore..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,the worst game i've ever played. i really regret buying it! this game has no physics!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,i love this game. i feel inside night city. as a first person the game remembers me to other masterpiece vampire bloodlines
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"the game has it's flaws for sure, although i feel that people expected it to be another gta in cyberpunk universe, which was never the intension. cyberpunk is not a very sandboxish game, it's main goal is storytelling, not trying to please overhyped expectations for it to be whole universe contained and alternate life in set with monster energy drink and sprinkles all over the top. if there is one thing that im concerned about are people unable to understand the concept of the game. i would say im taking one point out becouse of few bugs i encountered, but would say when the new patch makes its way, i suppose it's 1010. better than witcher 3 for sure, so before you say anything about the combat, please think again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,great game. amazing content and missions. in my opinion gam of the year maybe better
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"now when it's score went from 86 to 85 it's officially over. you can't promote your game as something epic, gamechanger, nextgen open world and then have score of 85. not that these score matter, because way, way better games than cyberpunk 2077 have lower scores than 85. but all i'm saying is that even professional reviewers gave up on it and that's something to archive."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"it's funny that cdpr had 7 or 8 years making this game and it comes out like this with bugs and poor frame rate problems that you need to unplug someone's life support machine to get it working but in all fairness it is a really fun game with its combat and character build, what this game lacks is the story, the story is really  confusing to the point where you can't tell if your doing something good or bad too bad its so short if you don't do any of the side quests, i don't mind bugs at all i think they're really funny but it can be game breaking with certain bugs like softlocking or hardlocking or even when the story can't progress because there's some floating car with a character you need to talk to in it, for the rating i'll give it a 7 the final boss was"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-24,"this game is special. full of heart. unpolished gem. 1010 also to balance the negative reviews played it for 200 hours, since release day dec. 10, 2020. finished my 1st playthrough on jan. 22 fri., 2021, already with patch 1.1, smooth as silk, on a highend gaming pc w nvidia rtx on psycho, w sli, pumping visuals even further with qualitylevelcinematicexrrtx after enabling hdr10 all over, as originally shared on nexusmods. didn't play on native 4k, just dlss quality  2560x1440 on 4k tv w hdr. ...so i was lucky to experience this game at its best, i  yeah, i bought that highend pc not long before it released...after waiting for it for 10 years...after seeing its 1st teaser in 2012. i remember the urge to write something here, a review, anything, defending this game, on day  then i did not. i waited. i played. i played for hundreds of hours, submerging myself in this radically different world, bathing in escapism, to write this review only after at least 1 complete playthrough. so here we are. i got a maxed out netrunnerhacker, completing all sidequests, and luckily getting a good ending, full of love and hope. no spoilers. some people write complete essays, as reviews, about this game. there are tons of video reviews circulating, looking at the game from various angles. what can i say in addition to giving it a score of 1010? i could write a short book about  i won't. 21 years ago, in 2000, i remember playing and completing the 1st deus ex game. a classic. this game had an impact on me, and provided me with an experience, veryvery much comparable to that, if not , 21 years later...which is exactly half of my life... halflife associations welcome  ...that too took half of my life, at least ...and alyx, oh alyx on a valve index, guys... but that is another story. so i won't compare it further to deus ex, neither neuromancer on amiga 500 based on william gibson's classic...which was my 1st cyberpunk computer game  counting amfv a mind forever voyaging from 1985   all the   this game  this extremely huge, vast, crazybrave undertaking  beautifully fits in that world, that lore, that gritty, neonlit, heartbreaking and mindbending virtual universe... i work in the field of ai. i actually do rd in ai since 1520 years. ...and yeah, the ai the  man...cdpr will improve on  to...just as well as the simulation engine redengine... they can, they want to, i'm sure, and they will. anyways, i was totally submerged in this creation. it could be better, as a game, and way more polished, of course. just remember gta v is out there since  rockstar released 4 versions  counting the rdr series, and their other openworld games. if cdpr pulls this off, they should be able to build up their knowhow and stack to a point, where they too can deliver similarly polished and perfected megaexperiences. gta v is one of the very best games ever made, and to say, that cp2077 is comparable to it, is already an accomplishment. the systems, that make up a simulated world multiagent simulation are key  rockstar knows that very well. just check their patents on traffic simulation, or anything similar. cdpr will catch up. they went probably too directly for the holy  even though it came out rough to say the least, it still is a totally immersive, extremely rich and valuable, supermature and freakin' original content!! dive into those stories  it is just  the promise, all the promise, of how could this be better incl. wallrunning, which actually i don't care about at  people mention on every corner is going to be delivered by cdpr, partly. they will round this up  i know. this game would have needed 2 years in veryvery well planned and coordinated development. so, by the end of 20212022 we'll probably have something close to the original vision  something that mike pondsmith creator of the cyberpunk tabletop rpg, and cp2077 advisor for cdpr thought, cdpr may not be able to pull off. cdpr had to grow a lot, in technical knowhow, and many other ways not just dev. count to achieve this...resultgame, after the witcher 3, which was actually much simpler, in terms of the underlying engine, and interacting systems, that create the simulated world. if i wouldn't have to balance negative scores, i'd give this unpolishedunfinished masterpiece 89 out of 10. ...but again, given its current avg. userscore is 7.2, i am giving it 1010. my drop in the ocean.  i owed this review to the game, and to cdpr. now time to submerge back jack back inda matr1x 2 xperience the other endings  peace"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"it feels like a huge slap in the face to most people who put their trust into them. yes they will fix this and patch the game, yes it will probably become another one of those great game when it finally gets working. but it does not change the fact that they think it's fine to pull off a debacle like this and get away with it after that. so much for the coming when it is ready , if this teaches anybody a lesson, that would be never preorder anything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"kurz zusammengefasst ist das spiel unfertig. ihr bezahlt den vollpreis fr eine unfertige nextgen beta mit nintendo 64 fahrphysik und npcs aus der selben zeitepoche. die story ist beraschenderweise gut gelungen... sofern man in der lage ist, sie durchzuspielen. denn manchmal kommt man einfach nicht weiter, weil das spiel an manchen stellen nicht zu ende entwickelt wurde und es herumbuggt. die map als statisches objekt an sich ist wiederum ein kunstwerk. viel kann man zu dem spiel noch nicht sagen, da es eben noch gar nicht fertig ist. jedoch hat es grosses potential. die entwickler haben sich dafr entschuldigt, was sie da abgeliefert haben und versprochen, das spiel zu verbessern. zudem folgen kostenlose dlcs und ein online modus, der noch wirklich interessant werden knnte. dennoch empfehle ich den kauf vorerst nicht. es sei denn ihr wisst, worauf ihr euch einlsst und seid in ordnung damit."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"my adventures in cyberpunk stole a car, found a crime in progress shredded the gang of thieves with the mantis blades. ran into a black market virtual reality dealer woke up naked and kidnapped. escaped, celebrated and partied hard. had sex in a tank, went to space, bunked out at motel during a sand storm. this game may of had its bugs for others, but i had no issues on high settings with a gtx 1070. had minor bugs but found them more funny and not game breaking. there were some things that bugged me like no barbershops or way to change your character. the driving is arcade like and the bikes are your best bet for a good experience. this wasn't what i expected in a good way, but also feel like there should of been much more game mechanics then whats there at the moment. still a great buy and recommend buying it at 30 if you can. i'm also waiting for the officially promised big patch, which the developer has announced publicly."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"if you play this game as a linear adventure it would be a decent 710 game. if you are looking for an rpg or a rockstar tier open world game this is certainly not it, and most definitely not what was promised. all the npcs are brain dead mannequins. traffic slams into invisible walls on the highway. the hacking in this game is just overpowered spellcasting, and a sudoku minigame. shadowrun on genesis in 1993 did a better job. you can kill people through walls just by looking at them on very hard difficulty. the same old looter shooter borderlands style mechanics from 10 years ago. there's no innovation. you are given no player agency, v cannot say no to anything even if you say no it really means yes. even if they fix all the bugs this is still a mediocre game at best."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"once first i seen cyberpunk 2077. i thought the game will not be my type. since i'm not futuristic games fan. turns out the game is very good. it did not felt like any other futuristic crap. this one is done properly, i enjoyed story and gameplay . i started playing with 1.06 version and end it with 1.1 version. got my pc crash 1 time in 40 hours of playthrough and had maybe 1015 buggy situations. i was running it on rx5700xt on 1440p on highultra settings and had 7080fps. so i think i got lucky with stability issues and bugs on my pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"i would start off with obvious, there's nothing to do in this nextgen open world city. graphics are only good when you turn on ray tracing spoiler alert most people can't do that. without ray tracing it looks like generic game from 2015, even dying light 2015 looks visually better. how is that even possible? police spawning system in this game is absolute joke. i can't believe how bad it is. i would feel ashamed, if i promised nextgen open world game and then released game that has amateur level police spawning system."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"this game was supposed to be a game changer. it isn't. it's not even a rpg game. it's just a pathetic copy of gta in cyberpunk world, but full of bugs and boring city."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"utterly underwhelming. despite being big cyberpunk fan i find the storytelling extremely bland and generic, with characters acting unnaturally just for the sake of plot. sorry to say that keeanu monotonous voice makes silverhand's already noxious role outright pathetic. rpg system is dumbed downed looter with meaningless perks, ai is literally nonexistent. some of the glitches are fun to watch but i have personally experienced no less than 3 game breaking bugs that made me reload previous save. hacking is fun fresh element and gunplay is reasonably well implemented. while bugs can be fixed i doubt it they can fix literally braindead zombie city due to complete lack of ai and the bland story. nail in the coffin were the lies by the developer which full well knew the state of the game while intentionally misleading the audience and reviewers and spending resources on masquerading the underdeveloped game by means of forging fake demo gameplay. coming when it's ready is a bittersweet joke."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"this is potentially one of the most overhyped games ever made. it's so disappointing really. the visuals and world design is superb indeed, and the performance is really good 50 fps with everything maxed in 4k on an rtx 3090 but that's basically it. the main story can be completed in less than 20 hours and 50 or more of it is just dialogues, and very little gameplay. the first act was really nice but the rest was just a letdown. most of the side quests feel like pointless filler content as well. i was really looking forward to this since witcher 3 is one of my favourite games but unfortunately it's a deeply dissapointing experience with a nice coat of paint on top of it. it's sad to see this is what they've produced in the last 7 years. i'd much rather see that they'd produced witcher 4."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"i love it. it is not my favorite game ever, but it's among them. yeah, it has bugs, but i'm confident cdpr will resolve them and the game will be a polished diamond and not only a raw diamond."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"no, this isn't gta in the future. or red dead redemption either. it's a full on rpg with rpg elements and rpg storydriven pace, and it's one of the best if not the best of this generation in that regard. it's not a perfect game, there are plenty of bugs and some balancing issues, but setting a new standard in citybuilding, narration in an entire genre is something worth of the top mark."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"it has an amazing story !! there where game breaking bugs at launch, but those are fixed or getting fixed. the gameplay is very fun the combat is amazing. it's a very good game worthy of the cd project red name"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"yes, cyberpunk 2077 has a lot of bugs, but also an excellent storyline and decent graphics. thanks to the authors!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,not very professionally made. it's obvious that no care went into making this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"just a great game !!! the story, the world, the characters are just great !!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-23,"first of all this is the best open world design i have seen in any game ever. people who are comparing this game to gta are missing the point, as this is not a game about cars and ragdolls in a sandbox. this is witcher with guns and it's main strong points are the story and the world. and oh boy they have done it perfectly! quests and characters are definitely witcherlevel or even better, including all side quests. sandbox here is a secondary element, and carbike travels are mostly to add to the immersion and to watch the city, and it works very well. enemy ai is good, not anything special, but defenitely not as bad as some reviewers are saying, and is definitely better than in gta, fights are much more interesting here. regarding bugs and performance. i have 6core i5 and a 1070. and i am playing in 2k 1440p, getting around 35 fps, which is fine for me. in 1080p it is around 50 fps. i have custom settings based on high profile but with shadows turned down to medlow. the game looks and plays perfectly for me. i started with version 1.06 and i did not have any critical bugs. there were graphical glitches at first but they are completely gone after updating nvidia drivers. there were few minor bugs but none of them were really annoying and some were even funny, like a talking corpse. but they were very rare and the most significant ones only happened few times in my playthrough and were fixed by reloading a save or a game. it did not bother me much to restart a game few times in 70 hours of my play time, many games were more buggy at release than this one. in the end i am very glad i did not listen to negative reviews and bought this game. defenitely the game of the year 2020 for me or even 2021 cause we will get bugfixes and updates. oh i did not even mention the music. this game is flooded with different kinds of music. there is a soundtrack with ambient tracks, then there are radio stations with tons of tracks in different styles, many of them are originals created for this game. then there are also samurairefused songs which are the main dish here. especially if you are a fan of rock and metal you will be positively surprised a lot of times. but there are a lot of cool tracks in other genres as well."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-22,one of the best open world rpgs yet. cdpr basically combines the witcher 3 with gtav. gorgeous game with a ton of gameplay resources to tailor your experience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-22,some stuff very cool but ultimately undone by lack of polish and glitches galore. i suggest waiting till bugs fixed and on sale
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-22,"just like witcher 3 it's pretty generic and pointless game, but this time even worse, because it's one of the buggiest game launches ever. it also suffers from missing features and has worst police spawning system of any open world game ever."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-22,"there is a good game, somewhere under all the crap on the surface, but the real problem is it failed to deliver on a lot. i would say that compared to other games, cyberpunk 2077 lies between no mans sky and fallout 76 in terms of failed promises, and is much closer to the nms side. tons of features they promised at e3, in interviews, in trailers, is not in the game. the game is also a huge bugriddled mess, to top it off. at the moment, its like gta 5 locked in first person, but with less freedom. the quests are bethesdatier in terms of how they are laid out and how enjoyable they are, but there arent enough to really give the game substance, and if you are playing it for sidequests and stuff like that, then go pick up a bethesda game instead. there isn't a good reason to pay 60 for something as mediocre as cp2077. maybe if it goes on sale for 2030 dollars, then yeah, but you can get far better games for a quarter of the price."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"before i say anything i am playing cyberpunk 2077 on pc. where do i even start, i'll say right outta of the ballpark this game is good actually i feel like good is more of an understatement i'd say its great i enjoy the moments cyberpunk brings, the characters, story, the world, some impactful events, the stunning graphics, gameplay and gunplay  swordplay is pretty solid hand to hand melee is god awful. yes there's bugs but i don't even need to get into that as i'm sure most people know the whole situation regarding optimization and glitches concerning this game. when it comes to the rpg style i don't really see it as much as i thought i would it's there just not as persistent as i thought it would be. the story is fantastic v is an cool character definitely plays a big role i enjoyed meeting characters and learning about some of their quest lines just an fyi take it from me panam is probably the best character in this entire game . as for my final thoughts i think where this game really falls flat on it's face are the bugs obviously but the promised content that was cut from the game is utterly disappointing making me realize that this game could have had so much more potential and in my opinion could have been one of the best single player open world games to ever exist at this point i'm sure cdpr is taking this huge slap to the face by its community to heart because to release a game that needed maybe another year of development was a foolish choice and i'll be honest i saw this storm coming with all those last minute delays if cdpr just gave the time this game needed and not promise false release dates and show off misleading ingame footage it would have been so much better than it is now. so that said the game is a good 810 for me i love this game but man they really did drop the ball in the endgame."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,one word it's just a garbage... great story but those who make this game mean little  waited for years.. i'm incredibly sad and angry.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"the game is fantastic, great enviroment great city great history. graphics are outstanding, bugs are being fixed. gameplay is fun!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"so much potential, a good story, good characters, great ambiance, magnificient musics... but so clunky, useless open world, major bugs,... they should have changed it into a full story game without exploration to emphasize the story, or just stick  district and consider the others ones for extensions. such a shame"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"after 150 hours story, characters, music, atmosphere, graphics and night city are awesome. the combat is good and can be very varied if you want to be creative. the ai is sub par, and the police spawning is just terrible. while it's not perfect, all of the greatness outweighs the bad sides."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"the only thing next generation about this game is the fraudulent marketing. the city is beautiful, dense and dizzying. parts of the main story and some of the side quests are captivating, until something ruins your immersion. be that one of the millions of bugs, the complete lack of ai in combat, policing and driving or the slow realisation that the game is not at all what was sold to you. after a while in night city you start to feel haunted by the ghosts of all the features and content they had to rip out to get this disaster shipped. it's a real shame. you will find many easter eggs that show a lot of love for the genre went into this game. but the corporats at cdpr have mismanaged what could have been a phenomenal game. as a developer myself, i feel for the devs and creative teams who poured their hearts and souls into this project. your effort is appreciated and i'm sorry your moment was stolen from you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,a huge disappointment. i ran into bugs worse than fallout 76. i played with rtx 3070 video card.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"the game might have been falsely advertised, and did not meet the expectations, but expectations should not really affect the quality of the product. the game is decent, story is intriguing, the world, though it's not really as interactive as promised is still stunning. gameplay, though its affected by bugs that ruin the immersion, is one of a kind. everything else, except ais and bugs, is on a decent level. not trying to prove anybody wrong, just thinking that game can be very enjoyable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"this game both complete joke in every sense and disastrous shame for the studio. technical quality is just absent, role mechanics and choices that matters  absent alongside with technical quality, shallow game world lorewise, story is just for the checkmark, atmosphere of the world makes me think of  version of gta rather then dark, cold, dystopian corpo world with the decline of human culture cyberpunk genre type of game. overall straight up misleading advertisement and big disappointment for all who was waiting at least decent game from creators of witcher trilogy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"every part of this game feels unfinished, bugs, glitches, broken animation, cars falling from the sky, broken ai, missing features, texture popin, bad ui, useless mini map, broken quests, unstable framerate and the list goes on and on, even on my new high end computer with a rtx 3080 did the game run poorly. last time i was this disappointed in a game was mass effect andromeda, at least the writing, voice acting and animation when they work are all great in cyberpunk and there is a good game hidden somewhere in this whole mess. it's good that cd projekt red is committed to fixing the game but i have already finished it and played every ending, there is no reason for me to come back, i already had my first impression and that is most likely how i will always remember the game. i really wanted to love this game, but unlike a lot of other fans this was nothing but a sad experience for me and i am not okay with paying full price for an alpha version, last time i will buy a full priced game from cd projekt red ."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-21,"feel betrayed, and not because i was on the hypetrain, and my expectations were unrealistic. i really don't mind the bugs, which will be ironed out surely. the issue is with the empty shell  if you go beyond the main quest  total immersion, living city, impactful decisions? forget it. it does not worth 60 eur. cdpr was one of the trusted game developers for me  i will never preorder or buy their games at full price. now, after 150 hours of play and i am only at the beginning of act 2 i can say that if you strip the game of the fancy looks etc, it is just a basic unoptimized, totally unbalanced, pretty lootershooter at this stage. one might ask why would i complain if i sank 150 hours into this, and why would it not worth the full price? answer is simple i sank 500 hours plus into e.g. tetris, still it wasn't 60 usd. i mean i can happily waste my time on youtubefacebook etc for hours, so playtime is not a good argument for the price of the game, sorry. the bottom line is that cdpr should have waited for an other year at least to release this, but they were greedy, so shame on them big time !! they also shouldn't have created such high expectations with over promising on features. it is good that they were ambitious, but should have done reality checks waaaay more often, and sync with  slap their prmarketing folks. the signs are everywhere some elements of the game are brilliant, and finished, like car interiors, most details in the buildings of night city. most are halfbaked, like the combat mechanics all combat, but brawling is the worst, weapon usage and stats, merchants and stores very simple, hacking, even the character creation at the start.. it is not an rpg, no consequences, no intricate changes to the story based on character decisions, nothing. some are downright a disgrace the economy and trading in the game, including ripperdocs, the crafting system, police ai and ai in general for that matter. many praise the graphics, but if you look in the details, there are issues there too just check the shadow of your player character shoulders are detached wtf?, cars in the distance are a joke just jpgs moving on a canvas, and were put there in the last moment to save on computer resources apparently. don't get me started on the bugs which are totally immersion breaking  and there are a lot, i mean a lot.. trees are glitching, characters  cars respawn from midair and breakblow up wtf?, v dies while walking, charactersweapons are sunk into the ground frequently, many times you cannot even pick them up, and the list just goes on and on.. no, this game was far from ready to be released. none of the versions, including the pc, which cdpr is proud of they shouldn't be in this state. they should be ashamed that they gave in, and released it like this. i don't think they comprehend and anticipate how much they lost on the long term. and for what? they should have invested more on investor relations and manage the expectations there, rather than pouring millions to promoting the game. this game could have been a brilliant masterpiece, but would have needed years more of development. if they promised less features, they would have been able to deliver a relatively polished version in 2021. but of course they should have fired everyone who did the pr and marketing for them first those guys are completely detached from reality in terms of what is possible in 2020 in game design and creation. finally, while we are on the waste of space topic... i don't get how the game critics gave 100 and 1010 for this  the game review industry is clearly broken, and shouldn't be trusted. i learned my lesson. did you?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"i was so worried of the negative reviews that i hesitated to play the game until some major patch, although i had preordered it an age ago. well, my doubts were unfounded. i understand the pain of consoleonly gamers, but on an a good pc, the game runs great and looks better. there have been many citybased open world games by now, but none was able to create a city like this one, with its claustrophobic vertical development and omnipresent advertising. the gameplay is based on sandbox variety. you can choose a huge number of specializations for your characters, both in terms of abilities and toolset. you could be a street samurai using weapons to solve every situations, for example, but even so, which class of weapon will you specialize in? pistols, rifles, shotguns, blades? and, in the case of firearms, will you pick power, tech or smart, each with its own defining characteristic? will you give up your cyberdeck in favor of a bullet time augmentation? or, will you use some stealth and cyber warfare to whittle down your enemies, before you jump in for the kill? what physical augmentations will you choose? as much as i like the gameplay, though, i really like cyberpunk as a genre, and i consider neuromancer to be the best cyberpunk novel ever written  or at least the best one i've ever read. its influence on the world, on the vibe and on the characters is undeniable. keanu reeves' johnny shares his most evident characteristic with an important character of the book. the afterlife night club would feel right at home in chiba city. most of all, the long sequence that introduces you to the main body of the game has you plan and prepare for the heist of the century and, while you get little choice in how the situation develops there, it made me felt like i was living that favorite novel of mine. if you are the kind of gamer that skips dialogues to jump to the action quickly, you'll probably find these sections boring. for me, they are what differentiate this game from the competition, together with the extreme care put in every detail. this might be my goty 2020, i laugh in the face of tlou and its woke tirades. that said, a lot of complaints are well founded. the way police alerts are implemented is embarrassing. driving ai is almost nonexistent. the racing and boxing side quests are shallow and really badly implemented. you'll probably be better off if you can wait until some significant patch to improve things."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"at first, i put 10 out of 10 without going through it to the end, despite bugs, friezes, crashes by the way, i did not have one and other technical flaws. thanks to the entire cd project red team for this game. thanks for the story, narration, side quests, great soundtrack, gameplay, characters, relationships panam i will never forget and all your elaborate open world! thank you for this game! she made a huge impression on me! but. having passed it to the end, i was very disappointed in the best ending, because i was not impressed by it. in this i expected much more and more open. sorry, cd project red, but i have to admit that some bugs prevented the completion of the tasks, and i never passed them. but ... let the poles just be fine"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"i spent a total of 80h playing this game and over thousand more waiting for it and hyping it. i had a lot of faith in this game because of all the success cpjkr gathered from the witcher 3 and all its dlcs. i thought they would never release an unfinished product but boy, was i wrong. this game is a shell of what it could be, features where trimmed to the extent that, instead of playing and actual open world rpg with thousands of options, places to go, skills to learn, you end up in a dead although beautiful city. the npcs ia is one of the dumbest i've ever seen in a game, the police system is straight up something out of a testalpha build, the combat ia is also extremely disappointing, the vehicle system is also difficult and some vehicles are almost impossible to drive, theres absolutely no customization in this game. there are a lot of problems and the game is in rough state, and i didn't even mentioned all the bugs this game has. the most bugs i've ever seen in a finished game. i still can't fathom to understand how this game got so much praise from international reviewers that couldn't even see all the glaring problematic features, beyond the bugs. the amount of 100100 astouneshes me, the more i play the game the more disappointed i was with it and after i finished it, i realized what this game could've been. it really could've been the best game of the decade, instead it will go down as one of the most disastreous projects in the aaa industry to ever see the light of day. i preordered this game, played, enjoyed the main story and the beauty that is night city, and that's it. if i were to do it again, i would wait until a good steam sale came up to pick this game with 50 off only for the story and the benchmarks that the city produces in my system. it could've been one of the best games of all time. but it is not. it is a reminder for us to never, ever pre order games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"pure art  graphics, music, atmosphere  the vision of the future itself, ...   finally spicy rpg that has everything. it just feels like the game was created by gamers. yes, there are things that should be improved  different types of bugs that do not affect the gameplay that much , but it's just a matter of time. the storyline and likable characters made me so emotional i won't forget about this game for a while for sure. unfortunately, we're living in a time when the best gaming experience comes from the high budget equipment, but even though my pc is nothing special, i fcking enjoyed this game. this is a masterpiece that touches your soul and keeps a part of it in the cyberspace."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"those who gave this game 1010 man you missed many points about this game. first you cant play a game without expectations and those expectations are created by devs and the company. i never believed this game would be a next milestone in gaming like halflife, gta 4 or rdr 2 but man i was expecting more. when you compere this game to something came in 2012 like far cry 3 or bo2 and watch dogs 2 from 2016 it is obvious that this game is poor in terms of content and quality. i am not gonna compare this game to any rpg because this isnt a rpg and i am not gonna compare this game to gta because it is obvious that even gta 3 does things a lot better than cp2077 bo2 has more choices that effect the game. bo2 had better level design with more variety in terms of how you approach a level or even simple things like using drones or flying jetsi know those were scripted but they changed the paste a lot cp2077 has none of this. what cp2077 has is underdeveloped gameplay mechanics such as stealth and hacking and only few choices that effect the game all of it before the end game btw and level design that is worst than any other modern fps game out there. far cry 3's open world made a lot more sense because you develop with open world without hunting, crafting you cant develop jason's arsenal or his skill tree. now what night city has some vendors and joytoys other than that open world is only for going one mission to another. you can get good loot from main mission if you are lucky you can get cyberware so what is the point of night city it is like a picture looks great but you cant interact with it . btw far cry 3 had better skill point system because it gave you actual skills not like cp2077's great 3 upgrade to my handgun damage. watch dogs 2 has a lot better npc ai and wanted system and overall better open world. at this point you should know that cp2077 has a terriable open world implementations. it s just bad in terms of story you my like it but it is nothing special and forgetable because it has plot holes as big as a meteor crater and doesn't even make sense. this game makes some good things like art style, romance and has likable characters but when you consider those lies and that thick budget they are expected it is like paying a worker a huge paycheck and then praising him after he does his job. if people except this game as it is cdrp will turn into next bethesda or ea."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"i like the game a lot! the bugs are unacceptable! the game has been delayed a lot of times! don't buy it on oldgen harware! i do have a high end pc and it still has  poping! i got to give credit to the pr and marketing teams at cd projekt red, for knowing how to hype the game up! and adding keanu was the cherry on top!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,they sold us a unfinished game and hyped it up to be incredible save ur money guys and wait for rockstar or naughty dog to bring another incredible game out
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-20,"wspaniaa gra ze wietn fabu. bdy i bugi zostan naprawione, a wiat z nami pozostanie i pozwoli si cieszy gr przez kolejne lata. brawo cd projekt red ps 110 h"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"i havent expected so much from this game. i knew from the begininng that it wont live up to expectations. but in my case it is just brilliant game with fantastic characters and storyline too short storyline btw main problems in my opinion are broken police or poor amount of activities you can do after finishing storyline and all side quests, i mean interaction with game world is poor because there is no minigames etc. but everything changes when you focus on main advantage of this game which is rpg mechanics and absolutly phenomenal dialogues. i hope that cd projekt will fix and add some mechanics in a few months. i give this game 910 even with its poor technical condition and a lot of nonworking mechanics like police."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"the people giving this a 0 are overreacting. it obviously isn't a 0. the thing that really irked me is that it really isn't an rpg. if you look at it as an action game, it really isn't that bad. the story is good and the action is average."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"regarding bugs and shortcomings, everything has already been said, but nonetheless, this is a must play. the plot not the main plot is a masterpiece. each task  every  has its own unique story and is written masterfully. the heroes are flesh and blood. the music is delicious. i spent  70 hours in the game and i consider the adventure to be something that will stay with me for a long time. strong 7.5  10. it is a pity that the developers did not have half or a year more to complete this project, because it would be the game of the decade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"great game i can't wait for dlc. great characters, wepons, cars and great map. a big project that makes you play long hours and there's a lot of quests and plot. i hope for the statements of the developers that confirms a great update to the existing process of the game. for me, it's the best game ever created and surpassed the expectations."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"this is the first cd project game i've played. the story and the storytelling are very immerse, which gets supported by soundtracks which are great and fit to the current situation. the atmosphere of the whole world adds a lot to that feeling. i didn't have many problems with bugs but i have heard from other people that they have had some. i'm just waiting for future updates and dlcs because i have trust in cd project and their work policy which will improve the game even more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"amazing game, its a shame they messed up with overhyping it. while it may not be what was mentioned in advertising in all aspects it is still an amazing game. this whole release has showed me how much bias goes into reviews and peoples reactions to a game. im sorry but giving this game anything lower than a 7 and you are bias or just hate single player story rpg games. the same people will turn around and give the latest reskin of assassins creed a higher score. such a joke. if you like story driven role playing games and the cyberpunk genre, you will love this game. just dont expect gta 2077, that was never advertised, the game never claimed to be the best of every single player open world game. that was the fans who after launch decided it should be. while cdpr failed to deliver on some of the things that were advertised this was not one of them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"the act i i have not been sold, but the more i play, the better it feels honestly. from the weapons and gunplay to the skills and perks. true the interesting characters yet there are probly still not as much as there were in the witcher, atleast so far it can really grip with a great story, especialyl the main quest. the bugs i experience with a good pc rig, are mainyl graphical and not game breaking, although i had some that needed a bit workaround. but i think those can be fixed, from the stupid loot literally too much loot, to the ai that is unresponsive at best and through so many scrapped features. i still think it will need some polish, but as it stands, on the pc, i really like the game and the more i play it, i like it more. it was lukewarm at best at first glance, but it really needs time i guess. that being said, the console launch is a disaster and huge stain on cdpr's reputation they need to face and more importantly, fix the damn game, so even on consoles, people can play it. solid 910 so far, will see further on. edit i finished the game. and then i replayed it. and then it clicked me. this game is mediocre at best. from the first playtrought i wasn't so sure about the replayability, then i replayed it. and it has none. there are no decisions that matters, simple as that. going throught the apologies and with how much had been promised... the more i played the more it became evident that this game is just hot mess. a well marketed hot mess with plenty of things scrapped. fix the game, add the features, otherwise it will die out. just like anthem did. 510 at best. that describes how mediocre the game is, if i played on console i cannot even pretend that i would have given more than 0, since what i read, it is near unplayable."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"the game was massively overhyped! the promises that were made were missed by a couple of years of progress. don't get me wrong. it's not only the bugs. bugfixes won't save the game!!! this is a very sad moment for the entire gaming industry, which is desperately waiting for the next revolutionary game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,kann den hype nicht nachvollziehen. das grenzt an betrug. die ki ist hirntod. es ist ein bugfestival und das spiel sollte mindestens noch 2 jahe in entwicklung sein. die presse und ihre reviews sind ein witz
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"of course the game has some problems. and, yes, it is clear that not everything that was planned has been implemented. however, version 1.06 is already well optimized and has no critical bugs. i enjoyed the game and am looking forward to new content. i wish the developers strength and good luck. thanks for the adventure, it was amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"there are definite parts of this game that would scream game of the year but.....this game was rushed out and there are multiple spots that seems to be just missing from the game. lack of interactive characters, police system, car mechanicsdriving, living night city npcs, reputation system, fully realized crafting system, tram system, and more in depth life path system other than just in the intros are some of the few things. what you do see is that at it's core there is a base of an amazing game. from what story there is, it is pretty good but what it was meant to be it is vastly inferior when compared to witcher 3, red dead redemption 2, gta 5, and choice consequences of wasteland 3 in which it was striving to be. the music and score is amazing and ebbs and flow with what the world is. the architecture is there further giving life to the city as a whole. it's amazing to go through the map and have the scenery change and know you're in a different area. in all cd projekt red gave only . i can only give half a score out of 10 for this. there is great potential there but there needs to be a vast overhaul to the game to receive that 1010 to deliver on their promise of an industry changing rpg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"the bugs aren't the worst thing about this game. terrible ai, wanting system, driving and gameplay. 95 of the choices you make are meaningless. this is not and rpg. leveling your character is a joke since you can't make your character a specific way which would make you want to replay the game. it all boils down to stat improvements. on top of that, the developers lied and deceived it's customers in their trailer,gameplay footage and interviews. blatant lies and deceitful practices. this doesn't deserve anything more than 0 because of this fact alone."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"cdpr has betrayed our trust and made a  game built up on lies and bull marketing. this isn't even a good rpg. they don't even market it as an rpg anymore. they removed any reference to rpg from the website and twitter. maybe because the skill tree is absolutely broken, with multiple skills that are 100 useless stealth swimming skill and the body shield skill for example. this isn't just a bad game. it was a  scam. and therefore it deserves a 0 until cdpr redeem themselves. there is the base  game here. but everything is unfinished and  even the story. don't believe the people who say the story and gameplay make up for the issues. the story and gameplay are two of the biggest issues in the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"it's ok. good graphics, past decade mechanics, nothing new to offer, still broken af, undelivered a lot of features. i can enjoy still because i'm a fan of deus ex and gta and it's a good mix. but it's not deserve the hype or the full price"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"no water physics in a game in 2020, no walking possible on pc in a game which promised great immersion. i could stop here. ai of pedestrians, enemies, police ridiculous still many quality of life tweaks necessary. interaction with open world quite lackluster. two points only because of some quite amazing and entertaining stories, although you get railroaded after act1. your consequences seem to matter in the credits only, not while playing. tldr a quite linear story in a potemkin village. in the year 2010 it may have been a nice find in the bargain bin, but in 2020 it is an outrageous lack of quality for an aaa title."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"let's look at this categorically. 1 point for each well done aspect of the game, out of 10. map good map size,detailed, a fair few interiors, issues with many unfinished areas, 99 of buildings are locked, also clipping through geometry and the badlands are a mess. immersive city nonetheless 1 point. artstyle very subjective topic we can discuss but people will either like or dislike it, lets give them the benefit of the doubt because of this 1 point quests narrative, characters, writing story etc etc, again as subjective as artstyle, but it's definitely got it's highs so lets just grant them a point out of the kindness in our hearts. personally i thought it was pretty bad, like it was written by a teenager and some major characters were poorly voiced and written. like v. nothing akin to tw3. 1 point anyway rpg elements for an rpg there is literally nothing to do. the crafting system is poor and a last minute thought. the looting system straight out of borderlands is perversely out of place and had me switching guns every time i picked something up until i got legendary highest dps i could find. terrible. upgrades and mods are also pathetic. ui for everything is the same pathetic menu with no interactivity, just here's a small picture with words, totally different to what was advertised before. the skill tree is plentiful but ultimately just ok as most options are just small percentage boosts. no way to tell what level anyone is. 0 points sandbox elements the open worldsandbox elements are non existent, why they made an open world game and made it completely noninteractive is beyond me. enemy variety is poor, not even any minigames like tw3 or kcd, merely 4 prostitutes. every neutral activity is a shop with the same ui as previously mentioned. extremely lacking. 0 points technology there is barely any code for ai, half the animations in the entire game are simply not there, 3rd person cutscenes are cut from most of the game from some reason, physics are bare bones and lazy. there aren't any systems in place, the wanted system is last minute sort of  there, customization is basic and i can not see my character while playing. photomode is pointless and a waste of time and resources when your game is missing most of its promised aspects. where are the corrupted police officers i can bribe, factions of gangs i can actively participate in, car customization, in depth ui with animations. 0 points performance the game is barely held together by a thread, oscillating framerates and an infinite list of bugs that kept me spamming reload saves. i dread to think of what the ps4 version is like. 0 points gameplay janky and tolerable at best shooting certain guns, totally poor at worst driving, melee, controls. balancing? never heard of it. does nothing innovative. 0 points graphics i played this on a ryzen 5 3600xt cpu and an rtx 3070 gpu averaging around 80fps. at best with raytracing on ultra the game is visually stunning, at worst npcs look like they are made out of paste, smaller objects like bricks of lego and as previously mentioned, a lot of geometry isn't finished. 0.5 points content overall there is a good bit of content. it is extremely repetitive and about 13rd of tw3s content, this game was advertised as a replayable, feature packed game, deeper and more mechanical than tw3. they will not be getting a full point because of this, since it is a downgrade from tw3. 0.5 points objective final verdict 410,  that being said. i was deeply disappointed with the product, cdpr lied through their teeth about a lot of features, and it is in an unfinished state as of the time of this review. my personal verdict is a melodramatic 010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"the game overpromised and underdelivered, this might be strange to read but the bugs are not even the biggest problem. the world feel empty, besides the side quest there is nothing else to do in the city, other than look at the empty buildings. there is close to zero customization. most missions play the same go there, kill enemies, press finteract with the goal. the choices you make have almost no impact in the story yes you can save or kill some baddies, just so they disappear anyway. there are way to little styles of gameplay and the perks you obtain feel more like a small bonus then a actual new and interesting skill. the ai most of the time is terrible, enemies, allies and other citizens included. i feel like they missed the opportunity to make more variety of enemies with the cyberpunk theme, 99 of them are just humans with almost no implants that change gameplay and why not more drones, robots, of different sizes and behaviors? the only think that is good are the characters, the main ones feel like real people, and they carry the story the story is a bit short imo. even if the game launched five years ago it would not have been impressive or revolutionary. i played 100 hours of the game to make sure i try to be as much honest as possible with my opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"this is basically the biggest scam i've ever been the victim of. i'm not gonna bother giving the reasons why that is, you all know it, what a freaking shame."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,its a common thing for any game to experience its share of hardships during its launch even till its first year but its performance and quality on the long run is what matters. from what i saw this game has a very high potential  a bright future ahead of it as for my own opinion im in love with it tbh didnt face any problems except the occasional glitch and in my book that is considered as a good thing

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"i will fight anyone who says cyberpunk doesn't have the most visually striking and detailed game world of all time. it's just a shame that the game that takes place inside that world is mediocre at best, and an absolute bloody mess at worst. it's abundantly clear that the game has gone through a seriously hellish development cycle, with large chunks of the game being scrapped and rewritten along the way, resulting in what feels like a frankenstein's monster , cobbled together from whatever semifunctional pieces they could find on the cutting room floor. there are features that were advertised mere weeks before launch that were cut from the game, and most features one would expect from a aaa open world game like this are simply not present here. it is a husk of the game we were marketed all these years, and the biggest sin of all is that cyberpunk 2077 fundamentally fails to adapt it's source material into a video game format, and there is no amount of hotfixes or dlc that will fix that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"i finished the game. 52.3 hours played. pc version is fine, some glitches but no crashes or major bugs for me. performance wasnt terrible, but its around 40fps in 1080p on gtx1070... playable great experience, i was happy to play and fininsh it. side questlines are so damn great. main story line ending was epics. gonna make a 2nd playthrough.... ....and 2nd playthrough didnt go well, i could see through all the cardboard decorations of the 'open world of limitless decorations', no real variability in most of the gameplay. there is some but defo not worth playing 2nd time. so 108. and yes you need a powerful pc to enjoy maybe even sli setup, tried to play on a laptop didnt go well at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"gioco fantastico anche se non rivoluzionario, convincente la trama principale, poco convincenti le quest secondarie e insoddisfacenti i contratti molto ripetitivi. ho completato il gioco in 122h e non ho riscontrato bug invalidanti come molti scrivono. i bug che ho riscontrato sono stati solo 2 il non poter saltare e il non poter correre, sempre risolti salvando e ricaricando, riscontrati circa 15 o 20 volte in 122h di gioco. il gioco  figo ed  un'esperienza irrinunciabile. i nei pi grandi sono le ia degli npc, le quest secondarie poco coinvolgenti e molto brodo con i contratti. attendo il dlc e si spera che allunghi di un bel paio di ore la quest principale tenendo conto delle scelte fatte precedentemente. il gioco non si merita tutto questo veleno che sta ricevendo,   stato all'altezza delle aspettative ma la versione pc  un gioco tutto sommato bello e godibile. un in bocca al lupo per il futuro e che tutto questo serva come esperienza per le scelte marketing pubblicitarie future. il gioco esce se  pronto. per fortuna ho acquistato la versione pc. tirando le somme 85 su 100."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"good game with good potential on high end pc, just need to fix bugs and add some features in the future for having 1010 or beeing the game of the year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"this was definitely not cdpr's fault if the game is buggy. imagine being under treat, what would you do? and the most interesting thing is that with this much amount of cut content, it's still a masterpiece! i really enjoyed it personally."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,this game was a complete scam. sure it looks pretty when the textures actually load but it is missing about 80 of the features they promised when advertising it. this game needed to be worked on for another 2 years and they needed to drop the old consoles from even being an option. what a huge disappointment. i see the potential and what they were going for but they completely blew it. when games from 2002 have better npc and police ai... you know you screwed up.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"never been so torn on a video game my whole life. on one hand, there's the 180 hours i spent with cp2077 and genuinely enjoyed. on the other hand, i'm dying inside, thinking about the potential it had. herein lies the biggest problem. what cyberpunk does well, it does extraordinarily well. but where it falls, it falls so hard that it actually hurts. don't get me wrong. it's not a bad game. at all. i do recommend it. the world is, for lack of a better word, breathtaking. i found myself just looking and taking in the sights more times than i can count. this is truly a beautiful work of art. one of best looking games i've seen by far, both technically and artistically. the characters, story and narrative are another high point. i loved them. all of them. they had such unique persona's, each with strengths and weaknesses. their dialogue, voice acting, motion capture and even the small facial expressions are absolutely top notch. they almost feel real. there is so much love and care in here, it's practically bursting at the seams. of course it goes without saying but there is a lot that is currently wrong or straight up missing. stability is the major roadblock as of now. granted, i didn't run into any gamebreaking bugs but visual glitches, audio hiccups and physics bugouts are a regular part of the experience. as is braindead or nonexistent ai. it really, really . the other major issue is that this is an openworld game that is completely lacking in openworld mechanics. there's really nothing you can do outside of predetermined missions. maybe you can drive around or go for a walk, but even that's a stretch as the number of glitches you'll run into will immediately bring you out of it. but more than anything, i'm looking forward to the day where cp2077's potential will be fully realized. if or when that day comes, it's going to truly be something for the ages."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"this is one of the best games i've ever played since i got my first game boy around 1995 or so. it might be best. it is certainly the best rpgi love fallout 34, pillars of eternity, pathfinder kingmaker, but i've never been as engaged as with cyberpunk 2077. yes, as of right now, the game has a lot of glitches. most of the ones i've encountered are immersionbreaking rather than gamebreaking the game has only crashed on me once, as far as i remember. meanwhile, i've literally fallen in love in the game sic. the last fantasy crushes i had were margot robbie irl and morrigan in dragon age, but rarely has any media made me feel what i've felt for characters in this game so far. i'm mainly writing this review while i'm hearing about cd projekt having to stand by their game. the game might not be perfect, but that's like saying the sfx in star wars are kinda dated."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-19,"cdpr turned out to be another ea. straight out lies, fake promises and missing features. sure they can patch the bugs, but the game lacks basic fundamental features of any open world game such as traffic and npc ai, and tons of missing content, which will never be fixed. this game is a scam. not to mention the performance of game is horrendous on my rtx 3080ryzen 3700 rig."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"one of the best games i've played with one of the most engaging stories i've seen in a video game. tackling themes like life, death, depression, family, and legacy, this game builds up some of the strongest relationships i've seen in a video game leading to an emotional and compelling finale. many of the missions are thoughtful and thoughtprovoking that make them memorable long after the game is over. at the time of writing this review, i experienced a few bugs but nothing gamebreaking. if you're worried about bugs, i would wait a couple months for patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"the most immersive experience i have ever seen in a videogame, i loved everything in this game, from game mechanics to history and characters. i think i was lucky and had near to 0 bugs, nothing gamebreaking or anything like that, so my experience was amazing. for me, it's the best game ever created and surpassed the expectations."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"overall i've found this game to be a real disappointment. i have been lucky enough to play it on a high end pc and still ran into game breaking bugs. some of which forced me to role back to a previous save loosing 15h of progression. cdpr's marketing was deliberately deceptive. the game is a shell of what it was advertised to be and in its current state couldn't even be called complete. their recently released apology didn't come close to addressing this. it's a shame, they've created a beautiful world that had a lot of potential. the game itself is prob more a 710 but the marketing and behaviour of the company has been totally unacceptable so 1 star from me. get your sheet together."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"cyberpunk 2077 the future is broken cyberpunk 2077 is a first person open world sandbox shooter where you play as your own created v, if youre buying cyberpunk for its story, youll be pretty let down as you can mainline this game in less than 16 hours and the story of trying to get your body back instead of sharing it with the legendary johnny silverhand is just a pretty okay one, but the sme could be said about the witcher 3s main campaign, but much like the witcher 3, the magic in cybperunk 2077 is all of its elements coming together, its not just about the main story here, its choices, building relationships outside of the story there is so much greatness here if you care to look for it and to build it, but there are some hurdles that will make that immersion tough for some players cyberpunk is basically the division meets watch dogs, like watch dogs you can stealth around, hack items to get through areas, but i personally found the gunplayberpunk is basically the division meets watch dogs, like watch dogs you can stealth around, hack items to get through areas, but i personally found the gunplay to be so fun here, and the joy of potentially getting a new really good weapon more fun tha nstealthing around, so i focused on a pure gunplay playthrough, if im told to be stealthy in a mission, i immediately pull out my gun aand go forward.. especially since the potential for large division like gunplay sequences are so spread out, especially by this games lengthy dialog, that i feel youre doing this games gunplay a disservice by leaving it on the back burner.. there are plenty forced hacky stuff to do here when the game comes to a crawl forcing you to find clues in a brain dance, or scan objects before youre supposed to stealthfully infutlrate an area.. the hacking in watch dogs if fun to me, it isnt fun here, so i really ignored hacking as much as i could the elephant in the room the rush job that is cyberpunk 2077, its clear this game shouldve been delayed to this year 2021, theres still at least one more giant patch coming next month, but even with the latest massive patch, cyberpunk 2077 is still littered with bugs on the ps5, 7 crashes throughout my playthrough, i really dont need to explain why game crashes are unacceptable, but theyre especially unnacceptabe in a game with such an awful checkpoint and saving system, the game refuses to save afer youve enetered combat until the mission is basically over, so dying halfway through a gun battle, pulls you all the way back, a lot of the times pre mission start, not even before you engaged in combat, forcing constant manual saves, just because you know how awful the saving is and if you die again you dont want to reskip through the minutes of dialog you already heard, and worse is you lose any cool weapons you pick up, which obviously  in a division like game where random loot is being dropped by enemies but i also ran into a glitch where my health would be displayed, where a call wouldnt come through that lead to a dead end stopping me from continuing the final mission and reloading an older save and redoing basically just 10 minutes of unskippable dialog, bugs where subtitles would be stuck on my screen long after the conversation was over, and the thing is i had subtitles turned off also the controls for the brain dance were stuck on my screen from an unknown mission all the way until i rolled credits, it wouldnt go away even after game crashes and fresh loads into the game cyberpunk 2077 is a mess, but a mess that once is cleaned up, is a really great game filled with over 100 hours of story, though this really is a game for those more into story and not those looking for a futuristic gta, the world itself isnt much fun to explore, you cant keep the cars you steal and the weapons are pretty basic. but the world is cool to exist in, even if youre not into all of the hacking and its only 20 hours like me. i give cyberpunk 2077 an 8.510"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"purchased cyberpunk 2077 just before christmas 2020, so it had been out for a couple of weeks and there was plenty of news about how it was full of bugs and glitches etc. with these in mind, and having watched a number of twitch streams playing through the early part of the game, i decided to pick the game up and try it myself, on a mid spec pc not running the latest and greatest gpu. maybe because i wasn't bought into the hype machine that whipped everybody's expectations up, and hadn't followed the games development for years, i went in with little knowledge of what the game was supposed to deliver, all i knew was the setting for the game and the basic rpg concept, and what bits i'd learned from watching streams of the game. my initial impressions once installed were good  the general theme of the menu's etc all fit with the games image, and is easy enough to navigate through. the game itself runs well on my midspec gtx1660ti gpu  i5 processor with the graphics set to mediumhigh and maximum traffic density. i get around 450fps with no stutters and lag. story and side missions are enjoyable, and its easy to get distracted driving round the city to take in some of the sights and sounds. playing on a medium difficulty level, it took me about 35 hours to run through the main story ignoring side missions, and i'm at about 80 hours in now and currently working through those other gigs that appear in the game. have there been issues with the game  yes. in my experience the ai is lacking, with npc's often just doing default actions like cowering when there is gun fire, and the police unable to chase you further than a block before you easily escape. cars and traffic in general is rigid in its pattern, often easily blocked by parking your car in the road. cars will also just run you over if you walk in front of them rather than stopping. vehicles will also clip solid walls and buildings, as if their predetermined route isn't quite mapped to the rendered world. i've had three game stopping bugs happen through different missions, where a prompt for a key press doesn't appear, or a character just isn't present. youtube tutorials has provided workarounds expect these to be patched at some point if you are stuck. i've not had any game crashes to desktop though. interface wise there are some elements that annoy  backpack inventory where you hover over items then gets a popover dialog which hides the items, it seems a better option would be to have the popover dialog fixed to one side and the items on the other. sometimes pressing the map button opens the inventory, sometimes options disappear once you've sold or dismantled a few items, meaning you have to close and open the menu again. the game itself expects you to develop an understanding of how things work without really explaining them  crafting and upgrades especially require a bit of thinking about before it becomes obvious how they work. however, even with those negative points, its still a game that has  me into its world and i look forward to playing on a daily basis. my biggest concern is finishing it before any dlc is available. i expect there to be another 4050 hours of gameplay to get through, for a total of around 120 hours. i like to work out a cost per hour of games, and for cyberpunk2077 this means its roughly 40p per hour. given that other triplea titles i've got have seen barely 10 hours of game time, this makes cyberpunk2077 pretty good value in my eyes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"this game no doubt has one of the best main storylines i've seen so far, great and memorable side characters, amazing ost, incredibly crafted and detailed city, well designed vehicles and sound effects. but sadly there are some downsides. bugs and broken ai which make the city feel lifeless. not even mentioning the wanting system which is a joke. you wont get a police chase, but instead cops will spawn behind you and if you're not in a vehicle then you're screwed. this game has problems, but every problem that i had can be fixed and added to the game. still, thinking about it makes me sad. wake the  up samurai, you have a game to fix."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"best game in the last two years, great storyline. the most beautiful graphics ever. yes, there are some bugs, but this does not interfere with playing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"this game is a solid 6 at best, been running it on a good rig, performance was not an issue for me.  false advertising on content  most advertised choices are not important in any way, the biggest dissapointment was the nomadstreet kidcorpo choice which did not matter  clearly non existent mechanics we're not implemented or we're cut in the end  there is nothin revolutionary in this game, there are games from 2004 that are still more fun to play than this  the animations are so horrible if they are not scripted cutscenes, it's tough to watch  no amount of patchesfixes will get it over a 7 unless they make a completely different story like blood and wine expansion  this game feels like an early access only the sad part is that i played lots of indie early access games that would not dare make their game public with completely missing ai features, they would at least do a best effort."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"incomplete and broken. 50hs gameplay, done all endings and most side quests. i will never return, even if they fix the game. played on ps5, the ps4 version, crashed at least 4 times a day or more. the systems were shallow and pointless, no street stores, no apartments to buy, a lot of promised features missing. outside of the main quest, everything feels underdone and incomplete. the world feel like a bad simulation, which it is.... eve the endings were bad and felt pointless... the life paths were meaningless.... basically your destiny is poorly sealed at the prologue, and that is it.... my choices mattered very little."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"this is the first time i've pre ordered a game, i've always torrent games and if i love it i buy it when it's at discount so i can at least help out the developers. well this time i really saved up my money because it's cd projekt red and i've loved the witcher 3. turns out it was all misleading marketing and lazyrushed development, so many features and content are missing. the ai is horrendous were past games from previous decade had better coding. i'm really disappointed, and i kinda feel both mad and bad at cdpr. devs were obviously rushed by management and that resulted in this mess. honeslty, this taught me to not pre order games anymore, and this is my first time. well, i learned my lesson."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-18,"bugs and glitches are the least problem of the game. main issue is total linearity and almost no variety or interesting branching quests. the world is dead and your actions have absolutely no impact. lots of missing features, and most of implemented mechanics are basically broken or underdeveloped. witcher 3 was better in all ways. shame."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"it's definitely a good thing that i didn't fell for the hype so i didn't expect the game to be the best ever made. cp 2077 is a very good open world first person shooter and i would say is a great rpg but only if i compare it with other fps rpg's like fallout or borderlands. the world, which is mostly a city, is very dense and detailed, i really enjoyed traveling around without using fast travel and the best thing is that it looks beautiful with only an rtx 2060. the gunplay is satisfying and there's a good selection of weapons to choose. i recommend procrastinating the main mission as much as you can, doing side quest and exploring the map in the process. now, i have to say that the game is very unpolished, i can overlook some flying objects and cars glitching but dying after jumping over props or walking on uneven terrain can be very frustrating."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"ladies and gentlemen, i hate to say i told you so, but... i told you so. let me preface by saying the hype surrounding this game was profoundly . w3 is still their best game. gotta understand though, witcher was never their own original idea. they had a wealth of source material to stem from and use as a crutch. these guys are no 2nd coming of og bioware i enjoyed my experience with cyberpunk because i didn't really have expectations per se. as far as goty is concerned, i don't play enough new releases tbh i only played this because i was genuinely intrigued by the setting and keanu reeves's involvement, and the fact this was allegedly an rpg bugs and glitches were negligible for me. 2 crashes in 300 hrs, pretty consistent 4550fps even on my gtx 1080 on ultra settings, which i'll consider marginally acceptable for a somewhat poorly optimized new release. i anticipate performance will improve over time with patches, etc. and both crashes were essentially my fault from excessive reloading, save scum farming legendary loot for hrs on end. i'm surprised it didn't happen more often lol basically this game ran better than 99.9 of other  i play, especially the overrated bugthesda trash lmao storyline is topnotch quality, they really nailed the writing, it's so onpoint, and the dialogue trees are ample i still find myself reloading often, but i like the color coding, though it heavily relies upon keanu reeves's presence. i've had a blast playing it tbh. i love that it dabbles in the philosophical realm, concepts such as free will, the self, human condition are explored in painstaking detail, etc. but yeah, there's a lot of superficial fluff, it's distracting. some of the design choices were plain ludicrous.  no vehicle or clothing customization.  extremely limited romance options, essentially 1 or 2 depending on orientation.  blocking access to a ripper doc just for punching the  was stupid.  they didn't really deliver on the nudity thing.  out as expected  you can't even see yourself naked really outside the menu and sex scenes, mods have been way better for years. it's not even close  not having 3rd person perspective seems a little amateurish imo. i enjoy immersion except when it comes at the cost of fun and practicality. it's a very cdpr game.  the atmosphere is palpable, but the city while breathtaking graphics wise is sterile and lifeless, barely any npc dialogues. these guys are great storytellers, but they kinda  at the world building in the literal sense. they did a good job foreshadowingcomplimenting certain quests in other regards through various ingame tv, radio and media however they have incredible ideas, shame they can't realize their open worlds like rockstar the world is the most important and underrated character and nobody does a sandbox better. r is a jack of all trades. they're good at everything, especially crafting authentic intricate worlds with very sleek gameplay, which is exactly what makes their games so ridiculously addictive, fun, timeless, and replayable the actual world in cyberpunk is maybe a cut above your average ubisoft copypaste gameplay loop  the criticisms of the lifepaths were a little unfair... considering there's a load of unique dialogue options. what did people expect? 3 separate versions of the same story revolving around a  colossal game? and your choices do matter, even on a quest by quest basis, sometimes down to a specific line of banter determining whether you successfully romance a character or side quest chain ends or continues. the  you say in convos actually matters or changes things for once some aspects could have been fleshed out more, properly, sure i'm obsessed with acting, writing, storytelling, so even if everything else is somewhat lackluster i can appreciate the sheer ambition. the hype around this game was absolutely   to reiterate it's almost exactly what i said prelaunch verbatim. hype couldn't match up with reality. if they didn't make the best game ever disappointment was gonna be inevitable for sure, it's not the best game of all time in the annals of history, but it's still a  cool worthwhile gaming experience, and i think that's really saying something these days lol ultimately... story was good, everything else was mediocre. there's literally dozens of games that do stealth, gunplay, combat, melee, driving, open worlds, rpg mechanics, better than this. it's more of an action adventure game with rpg elements tacked on cdpr kinda sold out in record time as i predicted like 67 years ago before w3 came out, strayed away from their roots, so i can totally understand why people are pissed. and i believe the story would have been underwhelming and suffered too without keanu reeves elevating everything overall, subjectively just based on my personal experience it's a 9 in my book, objectively, realistically, it's more like an 8."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,update changing score from 7 to 4 to 0. the game despite 6 patches is a shambles and unplayable on a midtier system. worse still it's bad. just a bad lazy boring dumb game.which says nothing and nothing can be done in an empty world. keanu reeves is a distraction! i never could work out why he was in it and why his performance is so poor and it's becasue we love him despite this flat effort. he's there to distract us from the rubbish. he's a marketing tool. he's the reason so much else is unfinished. he's literally a piece of tape holding the game together as much as a loud noise to distract from the state of play. the fact that they introduced him in 2018 means they knew. they knew and they lied. so zero marks for liars and cheats who make bad broken games and bully and censor players. update changing my score from a buggy 7 to a broken 4 after game broke near the ending and corrupted my save. no attempts to fix have saved my 30 hrs of play. original review pc over 30 hrs. gog. what can i  most hyped game doesn't live up to the hype. is any sane person really surprised? actually i was surprised just how much it fails to deliver on the many promises. but it's not all bad or good and that's the problem. the game is a mixed bad. the last of us part 2 was another huge mixed bag with some amazing highs spoiled by some low  low. well cyberpunk is a better and worse game so we're really heading into rocky waters with that comparison. hang on its going to get bumpy! the first problem is the bugs. they're worse than you can imagine for a aaa priced title from top studio. you've heard of them by now and maybe you'll know witcher3 also launched broken. but that doesn't make it ok to release any game in this unfinished state. it took witcher3 about a year to be worth playing and it went on to become one of the best games ever made without argument. cyber punk is not as good overall as w3. i'm nearly finished with around 30 hrs of play and i know it's just not on the same level... though but that's hardly a critism as w3 is incredible. cyber punk does have better gun play  combat but the story isn't a comparable and neither is v as a likable protagonist. when put against gerald he she is a joke. but geralt came from wonderful books so this isn't surprising. though v is not a good game character and his her arc actually harms the gameplay as a result. it feels like you're playing 2 characters in 2 games at times. one has this urgent agenda and the other hasnt. theyre at odds ans its jarring. making a game thats very uneven. and that's alot like tlou2 in this respect. its not good to be so divided all the time. the game isn't very 80s and isn't that scifi and ends up being quite generic and more like earth in 20 years and again that's not a good thing. ugly brutal nonsensical world at times and little is ever explained ever after a deep dive. it's not that cyber punky for no known reason. the saving grace is it looks ok most of the time if you have a 3080 with 32 gigs of ram but ofcourse you don't have that so it won't run well on pc for many. and on 's a train wreck sadly. i don't want to go into the irony that cdpr is ironically now the evil corporate entity the game vilified. they have lied to customers and misled them and reviewers. refusing to show ps4 footage for ps4 which will be the majoirty of purchases is simply wrong. i feel they lied about the game content too and are not the company they once were and still claim to be. cdpr is no longer the friend of the gamer  moving  main campaign is so so but ends without saying much or making it all worth while . it's not mass effect 3 but not mass effect 2 either. the gold is in the sub missions and there are alot of them. while the main campaign is only about 12 hrs the other stuff is easily another 20 plus hrs. you're looking at 40hrs for everything which is good value imo. plenty of variety but quality ranges and again not w3 quality. the ui and menus aren't great and the crafting is a broken mess. and the rpg elements are far from ideal. it's all a bit rushed to be honest. your progression seems broken too. no idea  many questions to why the game is like this which all lead to they rushed it.  the review i had hoped to right. not after 5 year wait. what can i say. in disappointed but it's not a bad game. they rushed it that much is true. it needs atleast 6 months more development time and in some ways it might get this. though don't expect anything sooner as they'll be making console versions work and then ps5 so pc gameplay changes or dlc will be a year from now. i recommend buying a year from now. or on a sale. too many small and large issues right now to justify the mess of playing. and what there is is good when it works so you'll want to wait for that. 610. when optimised and mostly bug free an easy 8 or 9.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,this game is absolute  i didnt have fun playing this mess. it has none of the features promised from no car customization to no rpg elements and npcs that dont work at all dont buy it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,so don't listen to what you hear. they're all a bunch of cry baby's that was disappointed by a game that was over hyped like the second coming of jesus. although they'd probably find a way to also over hype that as well. the game is awesome but it's not perfect and even if it was the game wouldn't meet the expectations

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"so many lies and misrepresentation in marketing up to release. game released in a a poor state with barebones rpg mechanics and bugs up to the shoulders. main story was pretty engaging, but extremely short and the ending was almost entirely decided by one dialogue option. world design was the only good thing about this game, but even then the world feels interactive and some areas are inaccessible. wish they gave it an extra year of development at leasr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"i refunded the game, it's so bad i wouldn't even play it if i got it for free. 010 to balance out for all the bots putting high scores"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,started the game and within a few hours i was bored. i gave it a chance with the story but was so bored with the cutscenes i was trying to skip the cutscenes especially the ones with keanu reeves. !!!!!! i've no idea what cdpr was thinking about putting him into this game he is utterly boring and does not belong in the game.!!!! the cutscene's are awful and most scenesdialogue you cannot skip i was watching tv whilst these played out. keanu get out of this game. the game is ok at best.. night city if lifeless you cannot do anything in it..sparce npc's but that's it. the game is utterly boring.. large open world with nothing to  an utter bore . promises of dlc's etc..wont make a difference it's lifeless...boring crap. dont buy it

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"this is quite frankly the worst game i've ever played in my life. everything that was advertised is just not there and everything is so blatantly broken. it's unplayable, i don't understand how people are unironically satisfied but, to me, this game is a gigantic fraud and not even worth a 10th of the price it sells for, i wouldn't touch this game even if it was free to play, that's how terrible i think it is"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,game of the year 20202021. super scifi immersion. masterpiece storyline and gameplay. played over 100 hours on the pc. i9 9900k  32gb ram  rtx 3080  uwqhd. no bugs ore leegs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,overpromised but undelivered. as a fan of the pen and paper game i was hyped. i still can see the ambition in the project. the truth is this game is an excellent example of bad project management.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"nothing great, nothing bad. most parts a like a gta v lite version. the story does not catch you at all and is in pretty much every aspect behind games like the last of us, god of war, red dead redemption."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"since all the missing promised features and bugs have already been mentioned and there are lists of them out there i will start with an anology imagine you buy a prestige luxury sportscar, it looks astouncishing, heated seats with a massage function, state of the art enternaiment system, etc.. but then you push that start button to take it out for a drive and realize that it drives like absolute  the suspension makes you puke while the trottle is as responsive as a coma patient. that is how it felt to play through cyberpunk 2077. the beatiful  the mediocre  the trash the beatiful  it has probably one of the best visuals that you can get in a game as of right now.  splatterdismembering effects are high quality.  visual design, detail and animation of weapons and cars are top notch.  the main storyline and the side stories which you can have with main characters are mostly quite well done and interesting.  at certain times the game tries to induce a certain intimacy with a play of presentation, visuals and voice acting that no game i played has made it like that before, beatiful. the mediocre  driving mechanic are really an afterthought for the most part but still functional and fun at times. there are specific offroad cars but they drive mostly just as bad on that terrain and flew of in the sky just like a sportscar or a truck. sometimes the driving behaviour is inconsistent.  the gangsystem there is no gangsytem although there are implications of these, nobody hates or likes you, they are just there to be killed and give quests at the same time. no playerimpact.  parkour running is a nice suprise th trash  gameplay balance, there is no gameplay balance.. i never read or watched guides on how do find certain things or specifically try to abuse mechanics, just casually explored and tried to go for builds and playstyles that seemed fun. but even after 5 hours in one finds insanely strong skills and aspects and after that all the fun from the gunfight gets less and less until there is literally no fight any more.  loot mechanics and inventory are absolutely half assed and not even tested. aside the fact that i can't loot like 80 of robots i kill for no reason i can also not loot 30 of weapons the enemies drop, that waaay to much. while the inventory has nice sorting functions it is absolutely atrocious at the same time combined with the worst inventory aspect i have ever seen in a trile a game  the crafting takes around 2 seconds and i can only craft a single item at a time. it is absolutely madenening. it is not like something emersive that i see my chaacter craft an item or just do random craft stuff like in fallout 4 it is just sitting in that inventory menu and clicking that button every 2 seconds like an idiot. this is below any standards i have for any game. and while the crafting is annoying as hell it is also brokenly powerful, i can literaly create stuff out of nothing by crafting and disasambling and i can get infinitely money that way even with a very low player level, why is this a thing. on to of that armor and weapon stats are literally random when crafting items for no reason while i noticed that literally my armorstats change when i just restart the game.  progression especially in rpg type leveling i like to get a feel for the numbers of damage, resistances and armor etc.. but the level progression and the way the stats scale is quite bad. in the begnning one has to change essentially the weapon and armor each 0 min because there are better ones but then when it slows down a bit i am already the god of night city. in the early game the game allows the player to try to take it on high level enemies but these encounters are anything else than fun, fighting is either stunlocking enemies with granaes for 10 min nonstop or die instantly and trying to do it stealthy is a 50 gamble wheather one can finish this mission or, i tried to make a very high danger mission to rescue a woman... only then to learn that as soon as i get to that woman a diolog starts and being detected is unovoidable. and i don't mean it is scripted, it just happens because the diolog was probably not there in the initial mission design to completyl break it. and why do i get a weapon that can shoot through literally any material and any thickness of it, it's just broken. why do i get 90 crit chance and deal like 100 times damage on every shot is beyond me.  the policee system it is so bad and cheap that just removing police from the game entirely would be a better choice. i can not even ignore them completely since sometimes i don't stand in the magical hositle area or kill a random citizen. there are a few more for which i have no space to write about like cheap life paths and choices in general, game is about corporations but i have no ineractions with them, citizens are a facade, minimap navigating is trash, exploration without minimap.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"fanboys guzzling in force, over sensitive cdpr mods and tons of lies from management, so i lowered it from 610. i feel bad for the developers who are being mistreated. i love cyberpunk and cyberpunk 2077 but this is just a let down. ceo's are ignoring the major issues with the game and seem to think it is great. everything wrong with cp2077 false advertising, tons of missing contentmechanics, semi censored hollow mess. broken audio mixing, police, ai, lighting, grainy reflections, missing sfx, visible open holes in the world everywhere. imbalanced game play, useless perks that show missing features in the icons. the open world is just a pretty shell. the good music is great though the in game radio is low volume for some, needs more songs and sometimes bugs out. i actually like the driving, though some cars need sharper handling and others need oversteerundersteer reduced. night city is gorgeous. keanu. strong characters that need more development."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most ambitious games i've ever played. if you dive into the game without any expectations, it really is amazing. night city truly is breathtaking. they managed to do a great job with the city, and you really feel like you are in a futuristic dystopia. i enjoyed most of the missions in the game, both main and side. that's where i think the game really shines. the voice actors did a good job too, and the characters are visually the best i've ever seen in a game. needless to say, the game is pretty heavy on my pc, which doesn't come as a surprise, considering how darn good it looks. it truly is a nextgen game. then we have the topic of bugs. sure, they are immersion breaking, but definitely not a deal breaker for me. i trust that many of the bugs will be gone with the upcoming patches, the hotfixes already fixed some of them. i'm not saying the game is perfect not minding the bugs, for example the police system is really bad. it's also very strange that people can change any part of their body they like, but there are no barbers or tattoo artists? the game shouldn't be compared to other openworld games such as gta, because it is a completely different type of game especially the combat. since you can't give a review with a decimal number score, i am rounding it up. for me this is a no brainer must play, i usually don't start a new game directly after finishing it, but this time my fingers are really itching for more!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"we were promised so much, given so little. the main story line is really good but the game feels butchered to say the least. we were promised a ferrari f8 , but were given 1996 toyota corolla. oh and that corolla has no radio, no ac, no doors and 5 years overdue for an oil change. but hey, the ceo said he's sorry and he promised to give us an oil change and put in the doors. in the end we'll still have a 1996 toyota corolla with no ac. where the f is our ferrari? this is nothing like all those trailers and promises you made over the last 8 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"buggy as hell performance is abysmal unless you have a godlike pc fortunately my pc is good even then, completely carried by dlss barely an rpg, lifepaths don't matter in the slightest, huge let down ai is absolute garbagenonexistent police ai was completely shoehorned in at the last second, they just spawn on top of you instantly and don't chase you at all cars and people despawn and respawn when you turn the camera around, super jarring and nonimmersive memeworth npc behaviour with them crouching in fear at the slightest tickle or tposing no character customization available in a world based on customization, can't even get a haircut the food in this game looks like complete trash they should've spent more time on it and less time on pnis2 they tried to make a gtarpg hybrid and failed at both gta had a more immersive world, better ai and systems in vice city, lol positives great loreaesthetic great voice actinganimations good story keanu reeves carries this game even then, he's probably the reason lifepaths were cut and why a certain thing happened to a certain someone pretty early in the game do not buy this game for like 2 years when it will hopefully be patched and maybe modders will make the gameplay  less"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"this is a great game in itself, but compared to all what was promised... it makes me sad. i expected more from cdpr and by the looks of their pr attitude they don't seem to acknowledge that, which makes me even sadder. they should shut up and work 200 on the game this year to bring it to the level of what they promised."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-17,"to all who wine about this game after playing it on console  blame the console, not the game. as a console player, you should be accustomed to low fps cap e.g. bloodborne, where fps can easily go below 10 during boss battles. do yourself a favor and save up for a decent machine to experience all this game has to offer. about bugs  the most frustrating bug i experienced during my 200 hours with cyberpunk is when a quest character was killed, even though he was supposed to be invincible, which made me replay like 10 minutes of the game. all other bugs are so minor they usually just make you smile and play on. honestly, minor issues are expected of the game of this scope."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"absolute terrible buggy mess, so much so i actually started listing the bugs i have encountered, which has reached 230!!! some of whom are quest specific, but the majority is what you will expect through your playthrough. absolute disgrace . 010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,steam bug  bug  .   ...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"as many others have said, this game looks great but is fundamentally empty when it comes to gameplay. feels more like a tech demo where you marvel at the detail of the city, but are denied any meaningful interaction with story and character."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"it's a shell. a shell of what was promised in various trailers and articles a shell of optimization on all platforms a shell of rpg elements a shell of meaningful side activities and side missions a shell of balanced leveling and gameplay a shell of a meaningful implemented clothing and armor system a shell of npc ai a shell of car handling and races a shell of world interactions with the player a shell of functional and easy to use ui a shell of long lasting story with replayability but photomode is nice, i guess."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"the most disappointing release of 2020. the setting, story, and gameplay are all fantastic, but there are far too many corpo lies woven into this narrative. unless cdpr turns this game into what was originally promised choices that actually matter a la fallout new vegas, systems that aren't completely broken like the ncpd, life paths doing anything more useful, car combathandling, this may end up being a fall from grace worse than bethesda. where are the meaningful skill checks? where are the interesting dialogue choices that aren't just fluff? so many lies may forever taint this release. let's hope the irony of corporate capitalism is not lost on the executives who caused this failure."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"i have just finished the game, after clocking 130 hours. straight out of the bat  yes, cdpr has made mistakes along the way, some of them serious, they weren't fully honest and the game itself is undercooked and could use another couple of months in development. with that being said, i still had an absolute blast playing the game. i played on a decent, but not too powerful pc and performance was good on ultra without rtx, or with medium rtx and some other settings lowered with high rtx i got like 2030 fps. there were bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking, no unsolvable quests, mostly visual glitches, some sounds repeating when they shouldn't gone after saving and reloading, and 2 crashes before 1.06 patch. first, what was bad  performancebugs  nothing that can't be solved with a few patches, but it still was a bit jarring and those patches should be ready before the release, not after  undercooked mechanics  like the police system, which simply does not work properly. granted, it's an rpg and not a gta, but still if the system is in the game then it shouldn't work in the way that when you commit a crime cops just randomly spawn around you, and you can fight them in which case wanted level rises, stronger copsdronesmax tac arrives until you die or quickly drive away. again, can be fixed in future patches, but in this state it would better to add it in a free dlc as a release ready feature  ai  sometimes the enemies just stand there and shoot at you instead of looking for cover, definitely could be improved  meaningful choices  there are a lot of choices to be made in the game, but i feel like the witcher 3 still had more of them and they carried more weight there in general  the loot mechanic  i feel like the better choice here would be to have each weapon have constant stats throughout the game and have it unlocked either by looting, buying or getting as a quest reward, instead of being drowned in a ton of loot where the same weapon can have drastically different stats based on the rarity or level at which it was picked up now the good stuff  story and characters  the story, even though shorter than in the witcher, gave me a lot of enjoyment and thought provoking moments. the characters met along the way, the relationships developed with them along the way, will stay in my memory as one of the best in the video games i have played thus far  the world and atmosphere  even with unfinished open world mechanics and npc routines, the night city is a wonder to explore and sink hundreds of hours into. level designers deserve a promotion  graphics  with a decent enough rig the game can look stunning. i don't play much of the new games nowadays lack of time, but i don't think i have seen a better looking game when the settings are highultra  1st person conversation  if there is one thing that cp2077 innovates upon it's conversations. they are absolutely amazing in the 1st person view, from small things like restless leg of a nervous person, or a short grimace clearly visible after an undesirable answer or a face of the person with whom our character is engaged in a relationship being very close to hours in intimate moments  no awkward 3rd person separated conversation views can compare  combat  i enjoyed the combat in the game, as well as the variety of different playstyles the game allows for. i played mostly as a netrunner, hacking people left and right, but invested in some stealth and blade skills, so i could also sneak around, hack devices, distract enemies, chop their heads of and hide the bodies, etc. shooting was fine as well when i tried it overall, if i had to guess, the fair objective rating would be around 710 at the moment. i give the game an 8, because what is important for me in a game of this type cyberpunk does very well and i didn't have any serious issues with it. with the bugs fixed and performance improved, i could easily upgrade the rating to a 9. judging from the experience with the witcher 3, we can expect some pretty awesome expansions in the future and then, who knows, maybe this will be a 10. it's a terrible shame that the launch was such a dumpster fire, if only they could release it later, when this was truly ready it would be another masterpiece."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"game still has bugs and other unfinishedunpolished issues, definitely make sure you update your gpu drivers as many bugs are solved with that one update! its not  9 out of 10 seems about fair considering the sheer effort into making it. it has its amazing moments and its got ton loads of content and its not hard to see an awful lot of effort has been put into this game in many areas, it does need a really fast pc to run in 4k! but when all the bells and whistles are turned up it looks amazing. as for the repetitive ai and police materialising out of nowhere if you commit a crime, that's just crazy and not realistic at all and can really spoil this game at times! npc's are mindless zombies with zero interaction apart from muttering a few words, so forget any real immersion or interaction. but what makes the game are the side quests and main quests which are excellent along with an awesome cityscape backdrop! so a buggy sometimes irritating ride at times but still the best game by far in 2020! this game has the potential to be awesome with all the bugs ironed out, improved ai, if they get rid of the stupid police! then include loads of new content, side missions etc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-16,"great storyline and interesting characters is what really makes this game shine. add to that a beutiful and well crafted world. the hype was immense but in this case justified. in particular i found the development of friendships and romances very immersive indeed. and weaved together really nicely with the story as it progresses. i'll place it in the top of the major legaue for genre, up there with mass effect and the witcher. sure it is has a few flaws. for me mostly graphical glithces and a few annoying bugs that required reload. nothing major in my opinion. some side missions can be a bit grinding, but nothing more than ordinary. only thing it really leaves to be desired is more of the same."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-15,"bom, eu havia feito uma anlise a respeito do cyberpunk 2077 logo aps o lanamento do patch 1.04 aqui no metacritic que eu dei 8.0 inclusive. mas eu acho que eu peguei muito leve com o jogo e agora que o hype passou volto para refazer a minha anlise. o jogo tem sim uma histria incrvel na minha opinio, uma trilha sonora impecvel mas o jogo peca muito, mas muito mesmo no que se prope, no caso ser o jogo que tem a cidade mais realista de todos os jogos de mundo aberto. o design de night city  incrvel, extremamente massiva, mas a cidade simplesmente no tem vida. no pc ainda  possvel encontrar muitos npcs nas ruas, apesar disso tambm ter sido capado, mas a impresso que d  que eles so apenas bonecos andando pra l e pra c como se eles tivessem sido jogados dentro daquele universo sem a menor razo de existirem, sem rotina pessoal e nem nada do tipo, isso sem contar a ia dos motoristas que  simplesmente horrorosa, os carros param do nada na sua frente, no desviam de voc,  algo absolutamente vergonhoso diante do potencial que o cyberpunk 2077 tinha e foi absolutamente arruinado. no existem animaes de comer, no existem animaes de instalao de implantes a no ser em misses. principalmente na regio das terras baldias existe outro negcio horroroso que  o trfego falso de veculos que so carros de papel que aparecem e somem do nada na sua frente. a interao com os personagens da histria do jogo  muito boa, da pra amar certos personagens e odiar outros, isso o jogo conseguiu fazer muito bem. o sistema de procurado do jogo  sem dvida o maior problema dele, onde os policias aparecem do nada onde quer que voc esteja e no tem perseguio policial. isso tudo sem falar dos bugs e do corte de contedo. eu no vou perder mais tempo aqui falando dos problemas do jogo, acho que j deu pra entender. se tem alguma coisa que salva nele  a histria."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-15,"i have a good gaming pc, so no technical issues for me personally  and i'm still really glad i picked this game up with a sizeable discount. if id bought it for 60 bucks, i would be pissed. this is nothing like the demo shown at 2018 e3. some game mechanics like npcs, stealth takedowns, driving ai, coliision and police system are so bad, they are 10 years late. side activity is nonexistent outside of kill everyone in the building and take a shard, far cry 2 had more variety there. everybody says but the soundtrack was really good which really puzzles me, because it feels like a random youtube mix, from rap to growl, of all things. lifepaths dont mean anything after prologue, i remember maybe 3 quests where my lifepath gave me a separate meaningful choice, and not just another dialogue option that would have the same consequences as another one. crafting is abysmal, it is so bad, i had to modify system files to make it at least look like a bearable activity. i have no idea, why there are so many consumables and especially alcohol, never used one. i started recorfing different bugs and glitches halfway through my playthough, and by the end of it i have 4 gbs of short videos and several dozen screenshots. and the promised vibrant night city is just a bunch of completely useless icons like drop points and food stalls slapped on lifeless buildings that have nothing on them. oh yeah, and i really tried to read all those shards that are supposed to contain lore and interesting facts, but got really bored real soon. i wonder why they put so much effort into that instead of, i don't know, side activities or police system? what i liked perks system. mostly irrelevant, because whatever you do, you can just pick up or craft a good gun and destroy everyone with headshots. but it is really noticeable how your choices make a difference as soon as you pick them up. unfortunately, the perks progression system is a total garbage, i finished the main story and all side quests, and i only have my crafting maxed. i dont plan on running around the city hacking everything just to level up my breach or quickhacking or fighting thugs to level up melee, so im missing out on something. main story  its ok. not the greatest story in the world, but not fallout 4 or mea either. rather predictable, but execution is good. voice acting is great, one of the best i've heard in videogames. felt like pixar level of effort. romantic questlines are very interesting, the only reason for me personally to play this game again is to see through romantic storyline with panam. overall this is just a very mediocre lootershooter that feels outdated on release. i dont know how they plan to fix it, this game has a core that is nowhere near promised and marketed nextgen openworld experience, its just a play once  delete  forget it game like one of those yearly ac titles. the only good thing i got from playing it is that i remembered that i never finished playing gta v, so i decided to do that and let me tell you  im having a better time in that 7 years old game than in this holy grail of modern gaming. a pity."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-15,"one of the best game for last ten years. yes, there are some bugs, but they aren't critical. there are few things that could be done better, but the game overall is brilliant. p.s. special thanks for ps players yelling"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-15,"pretty much a deus ex game with some improvements in story, gameplay, combat and especially super realistic graphics. apparently this game only runs good on os that supports true dx12 api. tried playing it on windows7 64bit, ran like crap on lowest settings, 1080p, barely hitting 2530fps on my gtx970 4gb. then, when i installed windows 10 64bit. the game didn't stutter anymore, played smoothly, got an increase of about 1520fps everywhere, to a relatively playable 3045fps. .system requirements for recommended is a gtx1060 6gb, so my gtx970 supposed to run this game at mediumhigh settings 60fps, yet it's still in early stages of being optimized. i know this game requires a super highend pc to play properly, it's a true nextgame experience, though i'm very happy to play it on my 7 year old pc with gtx970, because the difference between low and high video settings is barely visible."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,"cyberpunk 2077 is a game that encompasses aspects of other games and media and struggles to find its own identity. cd projekt reds vision and scope may have been far grander at one time, but the finished product, when not broken or buggy, is missing the magic of a witcher game or a full rpg experience. it touches on a little of everything and fears going any further. it feels afraid of taking any stance, righting any wrongs, or at times giving the player the option for better outcomes. from the developers that brought you the family matters quest with the botchling, its surprising that the game cant decide what it wants to be. a fleeting momentary mention of a trans character, tons of death and suicide, love interests based solely on body choice, and an 80s version of the corporate world compressed into one man. like a list of topics to add a checkmark to, cyberpunk 2077 is home to a thousand ideas, few of which ever truly follow a worthwhile path. when it works, its a beautiful open world with much to explore, but you wont be introduced to any of it. if you simply want to enjoy the games true stories and experiences, you will find very little by following the main quests. instead, you will need to explore the game, on your own, and partake in your own quest line. i would recommend following guides to help you finish major side quests which are so vital to the story and even the ending, that your entire view of the game will be based off of them far more than any single main quest. by the end of this review, ive reached 150 hours on pc, and around 60 on ps5. throughout my time i found countless bugs, glitches, even game breaking instances. right now, i cant even finish a completionist run because a quest simply wont work. ive taken hundreds of pictures, many of bugs, but also of beauty. i feel that cyberpunk 2077 was a vision of the future that for whatever reasons simply couldnt be fulfilled. whether it was time, or tech, or management, the game launched as it did to deserved criticism. while update after update wont fix the consumer confidence or previous experiences, i truly hope the game is fixed and expanded. because whatever vison they did have in making it, i can see it in its bones everywhere in game. im excited by the future prospects of the game, just as i was for no mans sky, and despite my fairly awful experiences im still optimistic. i wish them the best in their endeavor and hope to experience their full vision again someday, with a clear mind, and renewed excitement."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,"ho ho ho so last review was kinda long time ago because i take a pause of beating video games. and after this pause i choose that first game in new year that i will complete will be cyberpunk 2077. i think you kinda know about this game that it full of bugs and etc. so that aspect decrease the final score but this game have a lot of good sides and in this you review i will try to explain what it are. so first and main cool part of this game its probably an art style yeah i mean all this cyberpunk things corporation that think only about money not about peoples life, all this debauchery and neon signboards. second one  it's bunch of different ways you can play the game stealth, hacking or my favorite simple run and shoot. so if have option to pick your own play style you also have ability to grab that type of weapon that can exactly fit in your playstyle i mean if you wanna stealth pick pistol with silencer or melee weapon if run and gun pick shotgun, assault rifle or what ever you want. you also have ability to craft weapons from trash or increase stats on already available and don't forget to level up your own character stats and abilities. but what about story telling in this game? so it dramatic story about you and little friend johnny with a lot of explosions shoots and fun. also side quests on high level of elaboration thanks to cd projekt red studio, every side quest that i pick up and complete was on main quest level with it own different story that somehow connected with main quest. finally that game have more than 3 different ending and it is a great plus especially in modern realities. so will i recommend this game? probably yeah but wait until developers release bunch of patches that will fix this game may be you will get this game with discount and it will be another plus for you 3"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,"i was hoping for a 1010, but to be honest it is a 7, only because it is so broken that it's fun to see what i can get away with. update i have lowered this to a 2 because the game is broken. unfortunately due to a bug in a final mission i am unable to finish the main story and the game, even after the latest patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,"the most overhyped piece of garbage ive ever played, night city is an empty dead hub of recycled mission design no drinking eating clubbing and total lack of immersion for vendors and buying implants. the main story is short as hell felt uneventful and the choice later and dialogue felt inconsequential to any of it. life paths are another hollow element with zero impact on story or character. everything just everything disappoints"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,the game is good but will still benefit from future patches. i feel like its in the same state that skyrim was when it launched and it presents a similar experience. cdpr will turn this into a great franchise.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,best game of decade. for other users dont cry when you play on ps4 or xbox and buy next gen or pc
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,"this game, is a big lie. everyone mentions bugs, but underneath them is a broken game. the world feels super empty. v storyline feels out of touch for corpo or nomad path. none of the choices presented to the player seem to make any difference. driving is awful. shooting is ok, but it's shadowed by the rpg mechanics, which assigns arbitrary levels to enemies, that makes them bullet proof if they have a higher one or too easy if they have a lower one. no customization of your body in a game all about the style. there is no ai for driving no police chases, the npcs won't even turn to bypass you if you block the road. the game runs awful even on a decent pc rtx2060super. the writing sometimes feels off especially via sms and phonecalls. everything seems half baked like the internet, which is useless, can't even by a car there. open world is basically dead with no way to interact with it even though it was promised and marketed as a true nextgen open world game. physics are buggy can't even run something over with your car as it will glitch. the city feels like it's not real no parking, no trains, supposedly lots of crimes in night city, but police is everywhere. police is straight up not fun spawning right behind you, but won't chase you. no freedom whatsoever, can't even not pick up a phone call as to not break the story. a lot of exposure talk people talk like they don't know each other and explain everything constantly. ui feels super off, it's unreadable at best even simple act of comparing guns is tedious. glitches, glitches, glitches basically if you've seen the trailers  you've been completely lied to, don't buy!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,"the game was good. the minor issues that i experienced were overshadowed by a great story and an interesting world. it was extremely overhyped and my expectations were very high, on which the game did not deliver. i was positively shocked at how much more polished the game was and how well it ran on my hardware, but as i have said before my experience could be different from others. the short story was good but i felt that the push to do sidequests made the game feel slow, and yet the main story was a second long. the gameplay mechanics weren't anything special. to me, this game feels like a mix of fallout 4, gta 5, destiny, and witcher. i dont recommend this game for people who wanted a fullyfledged rpg, but the game was ok and i enjoyed my experience. 710"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,i completed the story and i totally disagree with what people say. it's a great game with interesting story and great gameplay. ending was very touching. it just needs a little bit of fixing. even my friend came to my house thinking that this game is a total trash. he played for 2 hours and totally changed his mind. i can't wait to see the dlc's. summarizing i got what i paid for and even more. i hope after fixing all the bugs cyberpunk will rise and shine. for sure it's one of my favorite games.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-12,the game is a monumental let down. the games open world is lifeless and shallow the combat is ok as well as the story its just ok. what happend to the role play element that cd promised seems like everything in this game was miss sold and that without getting to the bugs!. even if this game was bug free it would still be a lackluster shooter.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-11,"after a full play through, i have to adjust my rating. in the beginning i was amazed by the really nice graphics ray tracing ultra, the story and night city, only to get disappointed later on. if you only play the main story and some of the important side missions, you will not notice the serious weaknesses of the game. the longer you explore the open world, the more disappointed you become. cdpr has announced a next generation game with incredibly interesting features. unfortunately, only a fraction of it has been implemented in the current version. at the moment, it feels more like an early access than a finished game. the main story was interesting but didn't really blow my mind, reminds you of ghost in the shell and altered carbon and maybe a bit of blade runner. but unfortunately nothing innovative and new. pros  graphics  night city as a scenery  story  sound weapons, vehicles, world  first person relatively well executed, gunplay feels good  german synchronization cons  gameplay rpg mechanics, inventory  rpg downgraded to action adventure  linearity story  ai one of the worst  open world night city feels more like a scenery  police system  no real side activities  lots of missing promised features bottom line if you play the main story and do a couple of side missions, cyberpunk feels fine, but once you step into the open world, you start to notice how incomplete the game is. it feels like an early access version at times. most of all, it's disappointing that the promised rpg masterpiece just turned into an average action adventure. and then there are the moments when cyberpunk 2077 reaches its full potential. if you simply drive through night city with the relatively cool vehicles and forget all the game flaws for a moment, the real potential of this game opens up, which cannot be matched by any gta. because when it comes to atmosphere, scenery and just that cyberpunk feeling, cyberpunk 2077 is unsurpassed! unfortunately then you become aware of the missed potential, which makes you even sadder. there is a masterpiece somewhere hidden in this game. due to the release rush, you can see and feel how unfinished this game was released. i just hope now that cdpr is still delivering the game they promised us. because with this release they have lost their reputation and, even worse, the trust of their community."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-11,"410 this game is a generationdefining example of why not to hype yourself up for a game, no matter how much you trust the developers. cyberpunk2077 is also the most disappointing game i have ever played in my 25 years of gaming. you have to ask yourself, did cd projekt red deliver what they promised? and did they meet expectations with cyberpunk2077? because for myself, they certainly did not. found this review on steam, and i thought it encapsulated the game perfectly for me let's start with the character customization. in all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this game would be about. what we got, however, was unremarkable. aside from customizable genitals which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games, and in a lot of areas, it had less. many of the npcs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. in terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. to make matters even worse, once you've created your v, that's it. you can't change your appearance any more. despite the fact that the ads implied in night city, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics. the next thing i want to talk about is character choice. aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over v's personality or choices. v essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. for example, i chose corpo as my lifepath. after the very first introductory mission, v went from being a cold, calculating corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. i had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes. the world itself was also a let down. i went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. but what i found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. yes there are tons of npcs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. it is completely static, and the ai leaves a lot to be desired. as many have already pointed out, the ai seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. that's it. the police ai are a complete joke. if you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. in the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere. the story definitely had it's moments, and i did very much like the ending i got. i was very disappointed that you do not get to go back to night city afterwards, and see how your decisions affect the world. instead, you are simply given the opportunity to go back to your last save before starting the final mission. i found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment. the cybernetics and gear system was weird, to say the least. even playing on hard, i never had any reason to get into crafting or cybernetics to be powerful enough to get by. i wanted to get into cybernetics more, but even doing all the side missions and gigs didn't yield enough money to be able to afford the good stuff. by the end of the game. i had only added one or two new cybernetics to my character. i was also disappointed with v's apartment. you get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. on top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. i also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. you spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point a to point b. this is tough, because if it had been advertised as what it is, i might have thought it was a really good game. but aside from visually, this game was not nearly as deep as i got the impression it would be. part of the blame lies with me, after the witcher 3 i had faith that cdpr would deliver another masterpiece. that was an unrealistic expectation i realize. but at the same time, i don't think anyone can deny that this game is not what we were told it would be. yes it was probably largely the media that made expectations so high, but i do believe that cdpr did, in this case, overpromise and underdeliver."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-11,"the core gameplay and the world is absolutely empty and dull. don't mind the bugs, performance issues. don't mind the lackluster buggy cinematics. don't mind the hideous interface. the absolute terrible inventory system. don't mind the horrible way of getting sidequests through tireless phone calls, and when you kill the person you were sent there to kill and leave the building the npc calls you back instantly, magicly knowing about it, before anyone else could find about body or known the target was really killed. don't mind the uncountable times i have been cut from the immersion because so many weird things were happening on the screen, and don't mind the npc i'm having a cutscene with deciding to walk through me as if i didn't exist, numerous times, even when i stood right where the cutscene left me, after giving back control. this game is an absolute mess. i could not believe my eyes. the game gives you a glimpse of what it could've been because it has cool cinematics while having a drink at the bar, and getting your cybernetic arm upgrades on a cool cutscene, but then it never happens again. everytime you upgrade your cybernetic stuff, it's just one horrible menu with stupid icons. everytime you ask for a drink, a horrible menu opens up so you can buy random uninpressive food icons that all work the same way. and everytime you want to eat something you already have, you have to open your inventory, instead of pushing a button like it was on the witcher. first time you carry a body, they show a cool cinematic of laying it on the ground, on your very first mission. but then, forever after, everytime you have to put a body in the trunk of a car, they teleport. npcs don't open any doors, ever. npc's don't open or interact with anything, ever. when they enter a car, the door always opens by itself, and i know the door is not automatic because when you leave the car, you interact with the door knob. and the npcs usually clip through the door when it's opening or closing, instead of waiting for it. the car usually starts running off before they even sit or put the foot on it. this game is one of the most immersion braking games i have played in the last decade. i'm being impartial here, forgetting about the hype, threating it like any other game, looking over all the bugs glitches and clunky npc and cutscenes it has, not comparing to anything else, and just looking at it for what it is. and it is absolutely stupid. it's flatout boring. and it has so many dumb decision made, throughout all its systems. i was having a touching cutscene that was suppose to end in a sad way, but then when it ends the game instantly have a  delamain taxi npc calling me yet again and i respond to it as if nothing just happened in a super cool way. this game is on so much on rails it's insulting. there's nothing rpg about it. and the open world is trash, period. false advertising. all over it. they made it sound like you had so many choices, could do so many things, and it's just not. i rather a million times play red dead redemption 2 again, the game that was the most immersive and bugfree i have played in my entire life. not once i had bugs on my 300h or something playtime. not once i had something weird happening that cause me to lose immersion or enjoyment from the game. the missions were limited, yes, get from point a to point b and never try to do something else, but the rest of it.. pure gold. i felt like in that game i had choices, even though i didn't have much, but it felt like i could go anywhere and do anything because the world felt so alive. i genuinely cried in the ending, because i was so invested and hooked up in the story, which was really really good. and this never happened before. now i'm crying for cyberpunk 2077 everytime i'm playing it, for entirely different reasons."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"et tu cdpr? et tu? ... cdprthe rpg maker famed for the quality of its storytelling and side quests... makes a game with only around 20 real side quests. but wait, you might say, there are a hundred little exclamation points and question marks on the map! what about those? well, those are variations on kill this, open that box, upload that virus, kill that guy, rescue that guy, steal this, and only very rarely something else. it's instantly forgettable filler told through text messages on your phone, and little notes strewn around the desks and floors of the little region the mission is confined to. the missions are modular, do not affect world state in any way and almost never involve a decision. i was going to say that the witcher 3 was different and never did anything comparable. no notes on the floor. no blow up this nekker nest to get a reward. i was going to say it had a hundred real side quests insteadwith dialogue, cinematics and storytelling through showing rather than telling. the most important rule of fiction is show don't tell. i was going to say that but then i realized that i was wrong. there were dozens of similar questlets in the witcher 3. the thing is i haven't played it in 3 years and though i remember 90 of all the real actual quests and i could tell you about how i did them and what decisions i made, i completely forgot about the notesonthefloor questlets. that's how little of an impression they made on me. i forgave tw3 for having them because it had lots of other much better content. i'm not going to forgive cp2077 though because it doesn't. nearly the whole game is made of this stuff. the notesonthefloor questlets are given to v by fixersonedimensional characters bound to a geographical area. they're barely introduced to you at all. they're not rivals. you have no choice about working with them or not. they trust you no matter what. a relationship with a notice board is more interesting. what kind of character is v? is he a criminal? a hero? a discoverer of corporate conspiracies? is he procorp evil or fullhippie nomad? what's his ideology? does he think all corps are inherently bad or does he think arasaka and millitech are in the hands of bad people and everything would be okay if they were brought to justice? answering these questions would make the game an rpg. one with decisions. one with pro and anti playthroughs. ... but it's not an rpg. instead, v is a guy that levels up. and he gets loot. and he shoots gang members. why even bother having different gangs if they're just something for v to shoot? v is a generic amoral nobody who does what his fixers ask. note he does not transgress against an ethical systemthat would be immoral. no, he's amoral. which means not having morality at all. like a doorstop or traffic cone. and about as interesting. answering these questions would also require an exploration of the villains of cp. wait, who are those villains again? no individuals in cp stand out to me as villains. so maybe the real villain is the toxic culture of corporations! it makes good people do bad thingsa wonderful bit of moral complexity that can be properly explored in a game. but cp barely touches on it. and it certainly doesn't involve any character development for v. nope. v levels up. and collects loot. gunplay is mostly quite fun. but mindless. because it has only a superficial context. it is a struggle for the sake of struggle. nothing more. after writing all this you might be wondering why i would give this game anything above 0. the answer is that the main quest is quite good. keanu is great. there's a choice of multiple endings. there are subtle appeals to the subconscious throughout the main quests. in the cyberpunk atmosphere it's often hard to tell reality from illusion. but there's not enough of that kind of depth. there aren't enough characters either. there are only 10 or so real characters in cp. any of the witcher games had moreeven the earlier ones that were made on 5 the budget. those games had more cinematics too. the vocal cutscenehating minority got its way in cp. no cutscenes. fine. but they haven't been replaced with anything better. instead everything happens at a distance and you have to look at it. some of the facial animations are really good, but most people won't notice because the camera doesn't zoom in. what disturbs me most is that cdpr declared that cp2077 was finished in early 2020 and just had to be debugged. they thought that 20 side quests and just a choice of endings was a finished game. i have no hope at all for the next witcher game now. i'm sure it's going to be ciri reading notes on the floor and blowing up nekker nests for her fixer. and there will be a huge environment with ten thousand pedestrian npcs that have one line of dialogue and tell you to f off 1000 ways. i spoke to around 10 of the pedestrian npcs in cp2077. it was just that much fun."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,i played through the whole game in the playstation 5 and boy it was a joy but i can't help thinking that so many features are cut out and maybe even some parts of the main story are also cut due to time constraints. cdpr are leading the action roleplaying genre by a large margin buy i hoped they would give this more time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"the bottom line is cyberpunk is not the game that was promised to consumers. it's hard to tell who is to blame for this game being in the state that it is, i see a lot of people blaming executives and i tend to believe that. lets get one thing clear, the bugs on console are astounding not so much on pc but there are still some. the glaring problem with this game is the lack of, well, an actual game. story wise the game is acceptable, there are a lot of characters in this game you'll enjoy and who's voice actors did an exceptional job. keanu does a decent enough job portraying johnny silverhand, in some ways the sections where you play as him are some of the best. gameplay is easily described as a looter shooter rather than what the game was originally promised as, which was an rpg. virtually all rpg elements have been stripped from this game leaving a husk of what was clearly once meant to be a 1010 game. this game is average at best, and it's depressing to think about how much time this was in development and in public eye. it portrays where the gaming industry is and where it's headed, so many people preordered this game on goodwill and that goodwill has been destroyed in an instant. i'd go as far as to say that this doesn't even feel like a cdpr game at all, it's nowhere close to how witcher 3 was. though it does share some of the same quirks as witcher in the sense of the combat being repetitive. the ai when there is some is incredibly easy to get around and exploit, sometimes even just standing on a box will prevent the ai from doing anything to you. you've probably all seen the driving ai and it's terrible, all of the cars are on rails and will not change lanes to avoid anything in the road. they don't honk either, the ai don't seem to care about something in the middle of the road. overall, the game is disappointing, this was meant to be the game of the year and to set a new standard for open world games. it didn't, all it did was remind me of how good red dead redemption 2's world is. night city, while looking absolutely fantastic is so lifeless, soulless and empty. edit game is a 5, not a 6. this game is so forgettable, i stopped playing for a few weeks and i've already forgot just about everything in the story. the story is honestly so throwaway and doesn't leave any impact on the player whatsoever. unironically just don't buy this game, it's ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,i've played over 200 hours of this game. both on ps4 and pc. it's a buggy and unfinished mess. there are literally perks and items that do not function. at all. does it deserve more than a zero? yes. but it also needed 24 extra years in development it simply isn't finished. i didn't wish to pay to be a ay tester. i wanted a finished game.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"this review comes after a single, completionist playthrough clocking in at over 100 hours. ive tried to be as objective as possible, and ive done almost all there is to do in night city. the tldr is that im disappointed with cyberpunk, but its still far superior to most of the shlock out there. that said, cdpr seems to be turning toward the monetized ea shlockfest model that killed bioware. crying shame. im playing on a high end rig that can barely handle high settings at a passible frame rate. this is a poorly optimized, buggy game, which should be no surprise to anyone given the launch coverage. dont bother with it unless you are running high specs. however, i didnt run into any game breaking bugsjust some wonky graphics and a couple quests that i needed to find workarounds for. that and i cant unequip items because anything bound to the middle mouse is useless. annoying, but could be worse. speaking of quests, i was super concerned when the devs announced that the main story would be slightly shorter than witcher 3 so that people would actually finish it. that sounded like a euphemism for streamlining for the mainstream. my concern was wellfounded. the main story isnt slightly shorterits maybe a third as long and a tenth as inspired. the side quests are plentifulthe world is littered with them. but unlike witcher 3, the quests are not character or story driventhey are cookiecutter smash and grabs. character is what elevated witcher 3 to greatness. complicated, multifaceted, engaging characters, set in a brilliant world, matched with exceptional writing. but in contrast to geralt of rivia, cyberpunk gives usv. just v, who is about as inspiring as her name. vs friends are slightly more interesting, but not by much. the supporting cast are at best archetypesat worst, tryhard caricatures. the voice acting is generally good, if a bit workman and not overly inspired. i found myself skipping most of the optional dialogue, which i never did in witcher 3. ah, keanu reeves. i like him. id have a drink with him. but im fairly certain that not even keanu thinks of himself as a talented actorand hes definitely no voice actor. his take on johnny silverhand is onenote, dry, lifeless and monotone. it doesnt help that the character is incredibly unlikeable. the games general aesthetic is summed up by the lyrics to one of its feature songs we are not the sheep, we were made to rulewe like to watch, we like to taste, we like to  and we like pain. if this sounds like a revelation, then go get yourself a highend pc and enjoy the ride. but if youre like me, it sounds a bit catchy, but mostlypuerile. what ive been hinting at, the biggest problem with the game, is difficult to put into words. its a spiritual problem. despite the vast world and thousands of hours that went into the games developmentthe thing is just lacking a soul. unlike deus ex or shadowrungames that ask tough questions and ooze with subtle design and intelligencecyberpunk cant get beyond the generic. the writers dont get past corps are bad, and dont even bother following up with a why or a because. without the incredible source material of the witcher, the writers fall back on mundane platitudes and trite melodrama. all that said, the hack and slash is fun. for all of its many failings, i kept playing in a dopamineinduced coma for over 100 hours. i will likely even play another run. there are some moments of brilliance like the talking gun and the eerieasallhell crucifixion. its clear that blood, sweat and tears went into making this world huge, packed and prettybut its empty, all the same. edit after 159 hours of play and all achievements downgrading to a 6 because 1 the endings are dismal and essentially identical in terms of the consequences to your character. full completion and your choices during the game make little difference. you dont really make any meaningful choices during the game, so that isnt a surprise. the endings are primarily distinguished by their degree of dismalnessranging from mindnumbingly empty and depressing to depressing with a hint of bittersweet. think knights of the old republic 2but not quite that bad, since no one actually cares about v. 2 hacking and crafting are both incredibly dull. hacking consist of targeting, scrolling through a drop down menu which frequently closes before you can input a hack, and depending on your skill level, either watching everything die or watching someone get tickled. hacking is the caster class in cyberpunkimagine a wizard throwing invisible fireballs that just cause people to fall down, and youll have a decent sense of cyberpunk hacking. the main quest is halffinished. i'm clearly insane for playing so long. i'd rant more, but metacritic is cutting me off."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,they lied about pretty much everything. the world feels bland and not lived in. you have 0 choices that matter. there's bugs everywhere. it really kills a cutscene to see cigarettes and glasses floating in the air while a npc tposes through the character you're talking to. they lied about performance. it even took more than 3 weeks for them to issue me a refund.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"this game is great example where you put more money into hype and advertisements comparing to the development of the game itself. i would call this title biggest dissapointment of 2020. this game is playable indeed, i have friends who play this and they pretend to not admit they have been expecting really something more kickass. wait for bug fixes this is at least half year hard work, wait for multiplayer and buy for 50 clearance. the game is simply not worth your money. there are lots of youtubers who still hype the game, this is all about views and money. same as releasing unfinished games to gain money. as long as stupid customer will buy it we will have worse and worse quality. and i admit, i am one of them! but this is my last time!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,nice story and storytelling. fascinating cyberworld. good weapon animations and refractor engine.  not a rpg game. worst ai i've ever seen. too bad melee weapon using.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"the game is really amazing, despite the bugs. i would give it 1110 for the story and immersion but because of the bugs and promises that were not delivered i'll give it solid 9. too bad that they released it in this state. i'd recommend wait a bit until they fix it and add stuff to it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"despise all the critics i genuinely think this is a bold approach. not many companies dare to do what cd projekt red is trying to accomplish here, getting out of the damn vicious circle a lot of companies are drown into, without pointless dlcs and having paying to simply know the story. getting back to the good days where you buy your game and you get the best experience you can get from the start."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"just like everyone there is a lot of disapointment about how this game turned out. it is buggy and to top it off some bug after completion means i can't go back into the world after the ending it just loops me through the credits when i try log in! in terms of what is good  the story is great, keanu is fantastic, probably his best role ever! the game is fun but very poorly optimised and buggy all the way through especially some endings seem to have weird artefacts. wait another 6 months, pick up the game for half price and will be worth it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"after 120hours in this game, i can tell that this is very good game. it has some problems, and some missing potential in few cases, but the story is great. about glichesbugs i played 120hours and i never had a bug that would prevent me from doing quest... so i think people are hating just so they can hate something. the story is most important thing in cyberpunk, there is not many games with such great story. the characters are amazing, each with their unique personality i wish more games had npc like this. the game is not perfect, 90100 is good score for this game. im giving it tho 1010 because a lot of people are hating so i want to inflate score a little bit. the police system is odd, and i wish they would change it. the driving can be strange, but i like it, it is not very realistic but it is more a quality of life so it is okay. there are a lot of great sidequest but most of the time it is go somewhere, getdo something, go away, the typical quest to earn some xp and money. i wish they would categorize those, with the great ones, after some point i wanted to do main story because i thought quest are too similar. after ending game i went back and do all the quest and oh boy, some of them are best sidequests i have ever seen in video game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"over 130 in game hours. it shows that one can have a lot of fun with the game. still, the game is not for everyone. i'll try to explain why. story  undoubtably the strongest point of the game. you probably heard it elsewhere already, it is really good, well written, the voice acting is great etc. but. it touches on some really heavy, existential subjects, and thus it may be uncompelling to some. it's not your typical joyful ride, it is mature, and makes you think and reflect on things. also, the ending is somewhat vague, to fathom what has actually transpired demands patience and immersion. so, if you are someone who likes to bring justice and order to the world through your gun blazing exploits in the climax of the game, you will be disapointed. meaning  this game is not for children  they will not understand it's premise. open world and rpg elements. surprisingly, the city and your side activities feel unconvincing, at least comparing to the witcher series. that's because most of your contracts or gigs feel trivial in comparison to your main story line. going after those side activities sometimes just feels wrong. also the city feels somewhat superficial. it was to be exptected, though, as the sheer size of the night city really makes it hard to fill it with up with meaningful content. i mean, you really don't want to enter every building in the city to check for jobs or loot. people already complain about the constant reminders and messages, it would be even worse if there were no shortcuts. it is a game after all, not a simulation of an entire city. combat and driving. the bone of contention for some. i actually find combat very engaging and fun. the main thing with combat is that, you need to progress the story a bit and get some exp, before you can afford some cyberwear and skills. but once you do that, you can really enjoy the shootouts. to be honest i had my doubts about that side of the game, but it turned out well. didn't try much hacking, but it is solid and can be fun as well. the driving though... it's not horrible, but i miss the open fields and meadows of the witcher 3 for boy, taking corners in this one is tricky as hell. bugs and glitches. a lot. by the time you read this some of those will be probably fixed, but they are annoying. visually though the world looks great, at times stunning even. final thoughts. before you buy this game ask yourself a question. what is it that you like in games, and what you expect out of playing them. cyberpunk 2077 is a deep and engaging story about life, one packed in great visuals and music. it is like a movie, only ten times longer and, well, interactive. if you like mature movies then you will appreciate this game a lot. you will think about the story long after you finished it. but if you're more of an actionpacked, superhero movies person, then you may find this game odd and unfulfiling. one of the reasons for the outcry after cyberpunk launched is that it pretends to be an action game. people fall for for it, and then they are dissapointed. and that's my only gripe with this game. it tries to be many things at once. had the designers kept it simpler, it would have been a game of a decade. in it's current state it falls short of that mantle, but it is still an excellent game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"this game is  honestly. 100 hype, 0 effort to make a working game. and patches wont save this, the gameplay just terrible because of the braindead desing. after 24 hours of gameplay, its not the rpg that was billed to the consumer. it is a decent linear story that plays out in an open world environment. most dialogue choices funnel in the same direction with little influence. vs personality is already clearly defined with little room for the player to be what they desire. the npcs only act as set pieces, reciting the same one liners and crouching in identical positions when the player does anything violent. they drive in pathways that are painfully obvious and simply stop whenever there are any obstacles. almost everything can be cheesed with stealth and deaggroing. many simple objects like chairs and machines are inaccessible, not even allowing for the player to participate in the world unless given a prompt from a mission. the immersion is just not there. i personally can handle bugs and crashes, but i dislike that this game was sold as something it isnt"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"the game is excellent. i've got two kids but i couldn't resist to play some more during nights. i'm playing as a netrunner and the fun is great. of course there are some bugs but i can live with it. i remember bug in witcher 3 where u couldnt finish mission with werewolf, that was a bummer. going back to cyberpunk i don't play much but i don't remember game that i was so addicted to in a long time. thanks cdp for this magnificent pieces of art."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"this game has a fantastically designed city, the lighting is beautiful, and the music is fantastic. but once you check under the hood, things start to fall apart and it just feels like a facade for something it's not. it isnt much of an rpg, as there are only 3 things in the entire game that effect the way the story plays out. the game world feels hollow and there is pretty much nothing to do in the world aside from shooting gang members over and over. the ai is less advanced than some ps2 era games and is laughable at best. and the story is so haphazardly constructed that i don't even know what story they were trying to tell. the game as a whole just feels like it's caught in this awkward middle ground, where it tries to do many different things, but doesn't do any of them particularly well aside from the visuals. it also isn't a damn cyberpunk game, as traditional cyberpunk themes are absent and you spend half of the game helping the cops or corpos. soooo punk cdpr. however while it is a disappointing game, it's not a bad one. it's kinda just okay. there are some fun missions and the shooting is pretty solid so it's certainly not the worst way to spend your time. and if you're looking for a game to just go in a shoot some things, while staring at a beautiful environment, then this is a solid option. but for people who want more than that, this game most certainly falls flat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-10,"good game! the game fully met my expectations  the witcher 3 in the cyberpunk style. interesting plot, great design, good game play, secondary quests are no worse than the main storyline. i get great pleasure from the game, the indescribable atmosphere makes me come back to the game again and again. for almost half of the play time, i just rolled  walked through the city streets admiring the views. there are minor technical problems  bugs that do not interfere with the game. i hope the console version will be fixed quickly and many more people will be able to plunge into this amazing world. ps panam palmer one love"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-09,"for all its bugs and some very odd design choicesomissions unchanging hairfacial hair, no walk key on pc, a few others, this game is a 10. normally, bugs alone would relegate a 10 quality game to a 9. but in this case, what they do well is so far ahead of any other game that it truly makes up for any annoyances, and then some. the most simple thing i can say about why cyberpunk deserves a 10 is as follow... i have felt as much like i was in another world as i do in night city. not even close, not by half. most of the issues seemed to have been fixed a few weeks after release, in terms of technical stuff at least. but making such a massive, dense, detailed, moving world from a 1st person perspective jumps over the next several steps in a natural progression of gaming tech. for those leaving fully negative reviews, they either lack a basic understanding of technology and expected it to run on a low end pc or last gen console tbh if i realized this with my technical idiocy, no excuses or they were raised in a manner as to project their expectations outward and have a tantrum comprised of impotent rage and narcissistic petulance. maybe no mission line is at the moral complexity and is as deep as the bloody baron's, let's say that's a 1010, but the sheer amount of 810s and 910s easily compensated for the lack of a main story within a main story microcosm. night city may be slightly smaller than the witcher 3's world map, but taking into account the 1st person view, the density, the detail, the verticality and other such factors, it not only feels larger than that map, it feels larger and more purposeful than any game's map to date. never has any dev come close to the feeling of creating a real city in fiction...with a believable scale, populace, culture, etc. this is truly a new benchmark by which to judge any game's setting going forward. to actually believe their negative reviews, the degree to which one needs to hyperfocus on the negative and ignore the tsunami of positive is truly shocking. the density and detail of missions, the perfection of night city, the high quality story, unique class  much of this game blows everything else out of the water. they shouldn't have released it on last gen, but the amount of limb flailing, snot covered tantrums that the famously spoiled sect of gaming fandom would have resulted in riots had they skipped those consoles. the worst of fans wanted cdpr to use black magic to make a game that's 10 steps ahead in terms of technical achievement to run on systems 5 steps behind the average pc. so a quick personal thing...i got this at the same time as i got horizon zero dawn. the latter would completely monopolize my gaming time in any other situation. but after playing both for a few hours, even early with all the bugs, i could not justify putting any time into hzd. it just felt like i was playing a great example of old gaming when i had the next step right here."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-09,"a great game but has many gameplay flaws and bugs. even on pc which is the best platform to play it, it is not optimized and modders have already released tools to optimize it better than developers. i have seen more bugs in my 50 hours of playing than any other game ever. including some gamebreaking ones. the biggest flaw imo is the policewanted system it's completely unfinished or broken, police spawn behind you in droves and slaughter you for any crime and they don't even chase you in cars. on the plus side, the setting of night city is a winner. the characters are all great especially keanu reeve's character johnny silverhand. the gameplay is good but feels to rpg heavy with you starting off with weak weapons then becoming overpowered by the end of the game. also, the perk or skill tree is overwhelming there are so many perks it makes planning a character build a nightmare. the inventory is just as cluttered and hard to use. it lacked basic features such as a favorite system or a way to lock your rare  unique from being sold accidentally personally i didn't like the ending and if felt rushed or careless i think cdpr the developer hyped the game too much for their own good and made to many promises they could not fulfill"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-08,"although this game didn't fully live to its expectation, it is one of few games that support members of the lgbtq community that do not specify as the clich character choices on most games, straight males and straight females. in the beginning of the game you are given a plethora of choices for building your character, one of which is choice of genitalia that can be put in any body type, giving players who identify as other than heterosexuals full control over their look. and after the creation you are giving the full control over your sexual encounters may that be gay, lesbian or other. that is why i believe this game can be a gate way to the future of gaming, in the context of sexual identity and encounter."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-08,sin duda una de las ms grandes decepciones de la dcada en videojuegos....
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-08,"cyberpunk 2077 isn't as bad as people say but it's not good either. as most of you already know, the game was rushed and lacks many features it desperately needs optimization and doesn't even feel like a true nextgen title. as far as bugs are concerned though, it is quite well polished i've found nothing gamebreaking or even slightly annoying in over 50 hours, so in that regard this was certainly a better experience than skyrim and many other games. the ai is really terrible for an openworld game, physics are bad and the player's interaction with the world and it's npcs could've been much better. this has already been covered in most reviews so to speed things up, the immersive world that was promised to us just isn't there. even the older gta games had better pedestrians, drivers and interactions with main npcs being able to call them to hang out or date than this. i was pretty disappointed when the storyline that involves one of the main character's lovers was over and there were simply zero interaction possibilities with her she just became another random npc. i'd also point out that i don't like the combat, although that's more of a personal opinion. they took a rpg approach instead of delivering something more actionfocused and realistic, meaning damage donereceived sometimes won't make any sense even headshots to enemies not using helmet may take 110 of their health and you'll often stumble without any warning upon locations that look completely normal but have npcs that are ridiculously stronger, taking virtually no damage and killing you in 1 or 2 shots. storywise, the game is brilliant. excellent acting, engaging and immersive story, cyberpunk 2077 really shines on this aspect and can be a truly enjoyable experience if you're able ignore everything else. overall though, i wish they hadn't rushed this game and took their time to deliver us a more polished experience."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-08,"really buggy in pc, felt like i was playing a biyearly ubisoft game franchise, really shallow portrayal of a cyberpunk world to just give it a skin to gtaesque game with rpg combat. speaking of rpg, the most you'll get are weapons and clothes with random numbers plastered on them. leveling up perks and skills isn't rewarding at all since abilities will give you extremely minor stat boosts in certain areas. perks do the same except they sometimes allow you to have features that should've just been implemented from the start and they clearly added to pad out the perk trees. like max hp boosts, regen outside combat whenever i set myself to play the game for promises  story and great characters, i quickly got bored in an hour of some gameplay that tried to mush in other games in an extremely buggy mess. it tries to be like watch dogs 2 with its hacking but fails miserably. it wants to have a borderlands like randomized looting system but since it only has 5 guns to go for it's merely stat increases. it tries to be like gta but the driving and police ai's are missing and the police spawn quite literally, behind you. it tries to be like a stealth rpg akin to deus ex but fails so hard in its stealth mechanics and lacks any meaningful rpg mechanics other than putting some numbers in weapons because they proclaimed to be an rpg. massive disappointment and lackluster release, don't hope for a nms on this game. patch fixes can't fix shallow mechanics and world building akin to an extremely dumbed down cyberpunk novel draft corporations bad, sex everywhere, big buildings, tech advanced. if you hope for a game that tells a story like any of the deus ex games or takes advantage of its genre to bring about awareness in a world with extreme segregation from poverty and a lack of access to technology and how scary could it possibly be to live in a world where not even your mind or body can be yours, this is not it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"cyberpunk intense hype and expectation of next generation gaming are very misleading. the bugs really break the immersion of the story. the ai is very poor for a game of its magnitude as well as the physics. the visual experience of the game only comes when running on high resolution and hdr. otherwise all the details look very grainy and noisy, crunking up settings does not help either. im my 4k tv with hdr the game looks nice, assuming you have the horsepower to do it. i am very dissapointed, as i did not felt i had a nextgen experience. everything in the game looks and feel just like everything else we might have in older games. so my advice is to wait some months until the game get more stable and optimized thhought patches. and play it at least 2k hdr for some decent experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"unfinished game without an ai, a completely fake open world experience and a meh storyline that looks like a washed out william gibson greatest hits"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"i truly can't understand all the positive reviews for this nor people claiming there are almost no bugs. i have had high hopes for this game and i enjoyed the story but constant bugs and the incredible stupid ai breaks immersion all the time. especially the car ai is one of the worst i have ever seen with absolutely no thought put into it. the car physics are fun but thats about the only good thing i can say about cars. when it comes to bugs, this game is nearly broken. cars keep appearing out of nowhere and disappearing into nowhere right in front of you. on missions ai cars run you over because none of them are even programmed to mind you at all. if you get police on you, have fun with 10 npc spawning right on you and instantly killing you. there are absolutely no rules what spawns and despawns when and where. sometimes it's so bad that you cannot even progress anymore because some conversation is stuck. i usually dont really care to much about bugs nor write reviews about it, i accept things going wrong like in skyrim, red dead redemption etc , but this game punches you in the face constantly with all kinds of bugs which i find is an insult considering how long this game took to be released. this game isn't all bad but unfortunately it is enough to get completely frustrated with it. if you play the game entirely for the story, then you will have fun with it. if you want a halfway deep, immersive and polished game, you best stay away from it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"just one step behind the witcher 3. i was playing on a brand new pc, so i didn't encounter many bugs or fps drops. the story is breathtaking, mysterious and keeps you in your chair. your character v is fighting for one more day, hour and you certainly can feel it as the game progress. main quests are so good that every one seperated can be made into a movie for example stealing biochip from yorinobu. side quest are also great and can make you forget about main story, because some of them are more like main quests itself. cdpr for sure knows how to write a story. but there is also a dark side of the story, your choices doesn't influence the city and relations with characters on the level developers announced. furthermore the romances are sort of  up. you just do couple of missions to bang someone. that's it. the climate of nc is just how it supposed to be. you can feel those dirty streets, corp influence and constant fear for your life. on the other hand ai in this game is something to be patched because npcs as well as enemies are just stupid. music, graphics, humour is just as we all expected from studio like cdpr. for me gameplay is great. shooting feels real, you have to deal with recoil etc. i wasn't the type of ninja so i can't tell much about being stealth. but driving is much harder than in other games. although it feels more real because you certainly cannot turn if you are going like 140mph. from my expierience game doesn't have many bugs. the most common bugs were all kinds of items stuck midair like cigarettes, food, drinks etc. overall it's truly revolutionary expierience and i think patches will surely make the game a 1010"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"cyberpunk 2077 has a lot of decent stuff going for it. the combat is surprisingly fun and the story and characters are well done. the music and sound engineering are fairly well done, though even that needs a bit of work, and the world is something incredible to look at. but that's kind of where the positives end and the negatives begin. everyone already knows about the slew of bugs and performance issues plaguing this game, so i won't go too much into how npc's get stuck in walls and the floor, or how your character might teleport across the map to cling to a nearby ladder, or how you can't loot a multitude of items because they're partially imbedded into a surface. those are just a few of the many bugs. the ai in this game is horrible. npc's are dumb as rocks. they'll run you over if you even so much as step in the street, but they'll stop if your car is hanging over the road by a half an inch and refuse to drive around, causing a massive traffic jam. i constantly walk or drive by to find cars just stopped in the street for no reason. enemy npc's aren't all that much better. all in all, the ai in this game needs a complete and total rework, top to bottom. it's hot garbage. where the real issues lie is with some of the core systems of the game, and that's what has disappointed me the most. when you start getting to know the cyberpunk 2077 core mechanic ecosystem as a whole, you begin to understand that most of these core systems were developed into worthlessness by cdpr. let me try to explain.. crafting is worthless because of the economy, loot and combat. basically, on even hard difficulty, you can get by with a common white weapon and kill enemies just fine, and so many weapons drop, including rare, epic and legendary ones, that you just never need to worry about crafting or upgrading your favorite weapon. in fact, it's kind of difficult to have a favorite weapon, because cdpr made crafting and upgrading weapons so out of reach, it's not worthwhile to keep your favorite up to par. on top of this, so much junk loot drops that you can essentially just sell the junk and do side missions and you'll be rich. by the time i was level 12 and nearly done with all of the side missions in the starting area, i had already decked my character out in quite a many epic and legendary cyberware augmentations very expensive, expensive mods for said cyberware, and had over 120,000 eddies to my name on top of it. so, i can basically buy whatever weapon i want, but i don't even need to because so many weapons drop in the world, making buying or crafting pointless. not only that, but, here's the real issue you need legendary crafting materials to craft epic weapons, epic crafting materials to craft rare weapons and rare crafting materials to craft uncommon weapons. so, essentially, you have to dismantle superior weapons in order to craft lesser one's.. excuse me, but what?! no, seriously, wth was cdpr thinking? especially considering how combat being so easy and weapons dropping so freely already made crafting pointless, they just made it even more out of reach by making the system require mats from better weapons to craft lesser ones. i'm just at a loss as to the thinking behind this. instead of the core systems of the game working together in harmony to create a fun and worthwhile experience, they fight with one another in a way that one or more of them has to lose, and it's the crafting and upgrade system that loses out on this one. not to mention, the entire loot system is broken. i don't want to get a legendary weapon early on in the game and then so quickly have it relegated to uselessness by a common, white weapon after only an hour or so of leveling up, and then have upgrading said legendary be such a difficult task due to impossible material requirements that it's all made pointless to even try to collect and use weapons that you enjoy. it needed way more time in development before release to be the masterpiece that we were all lead to believe it was going to be. one of the lead developers even said that they had to start over from scratch a handful of times over the last few years. what we're looking at is maybe 2 years at most worth of straightforward work, much of that done with last min crunch. the game needs a lot of bug fixes and quality of life updates. but on a whole, it needs to go back to the drawing board and be reworked entirely to alleviate the many compounding issues within the core systems of the game. this video points out exactly what makes crafting in cyberpunk 2077 such a pointless endeavor. you can literally spend the entire game gaining weapons and materials, and never once find a use for crafting, simply because of how poorly it was implemented. the materials are too out of reach to make it viable vs simply looting corpses hjkebbk9ya cyberpunk 2077 might just go down as the biggest letdown in the history of gaming if they don't fix it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"i like the game for that, that it is. a beautiful story based game with nice characters. it has some bugs an maybe i was lucky, but i didnt has many problems with them. mostly little visual bugs. so yeah a 910. 1 for the bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"it's interesting how people are looking for excuses to hate this game. yeah it's buggy, but outside of that the criticisms of this game are mainly rooted in cheap excuses to see a problem where there isn't any. this game is beautiful, when you can avoid the bugs the scenery and visuals are breathtaking. the story is a carefully crafted masterpiece and the characters make you feel deeply connected to the people of this universe."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"20 hours in, 12 bugs, using a 1660 super at medium 60fps. the story is good, but the open world is amazing, and i get lost in it often. i will update this review as i play the game. update got a few bugs, and gameplay is getting stale. at 40 hours and not even met panam yet, side quests are awesome."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"worst version of the best game i ever played. story is a masterpiece. in the pc version, there are lots of bugs, but only some of them interfere with the gameplay to a small extent. give this game 6 months and it's gonna be perfect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"a masterpiece. if you're somehow able to turn a blind eye for the massive amount of bugs, which in my opinion make the game barely acceptable and stomach some design flaws... then you're in for a ride of a lifetime. the storyline is absolutely great, with masterfully crafted characters and a superb setting. the cityscape is absolutely breathtaking. the feeling of an overexaggerated, oversexualized and overbrutalized dystopian city of the future is unlike anything else released until now. gameplay is very interesting, quite far away from a typical fps, with meaty weapons that have very distinct capabilities, different implants and skills. there are a lot of possibilities  some of the missions you can solve by talking your way out, opening a hidden door requiring a skill check, some you can finish stealthily or by going for an allout assault. some are just excuses for hanging out or dating other people. choices you make have an impact on the outcome of the game. my first ending, which happened after 45 hours of gameplay, accidentally turned out to be the most depressing one. felt very uneasy when i saw the main character struggle, letting everyone down and doing something deeply unsettling, without going into any spoilers. i literally shed tears over pixels on a monitor. the very fact that it happened speaks volumes about this game  it is a feeling that is hard to describe. like i mentioned before, it is flawed. starting with bugs, through wonky ai, stiff civilian crowds and ending with some questionable gameplay design decisions. but forget about it. when the game is at its best  it's an emotional, gripping ride exploring life, death, technology and what it means to be human. boldly going into places where aaa games are afraid of stepping into, blending cuttingedge graphics with a deep, unbridled  emotional storyline. it's totally worth forgiving for all of the bad."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"i was a huge fan of cd projekt red for 13 years since the first witcher and i liked the gog's policy, despite preferring other platforms for their functionality. i really didn't want to bring this up, but the gogcdpr actions and attitude left me no choice. the cyberpunk 2077 is raw, unpolished and bugged as hell. the more i play  the more broken quests, silent dialogues and other technical issues i get. i was sending bug reports and suggestions to the cdpr support since release, but i haven't got any replies. zero. not even automatic ones, so i don't know if they even check them or no. there are no answers, there are no patches, there is no roadmap. the dayone patch arrived on gog later than on other platforms and after that only two useless hotfixes were released it didn't fix anything for me. no real patches for a month, no new hotfixes for weeks. the russian localization is terrible and galaxy client resetting the language preferences every time i launch the game. there is no such problem on other stores. and the client still crashes ten times per day. i've heard a lot of complaints about optimization, but at least i don't have any significant problems on that front despite some minor fps drops and object popping. though i've built my pc especially for cyberpunk and my tv supports only 1080p resolution at 60fps which is likely the main reason ive got an ok performance. gogcdpr stuff keep ignoring all problems with cyberpunk and galaxy launcher, but this isn't the only problem they prefer to turn a blind eye for. some of you may know that they decided to cancel the longawaited release of an indie game devotion on gog to please some chinese bots. they've slaughtered the game without any reasons the little placeholder with the hurtless joke was completely removed from the game years ago. and the main problem in this situation that gog staff answered on twitter bot messages within a few hours by fully cancelling the promised release not only for china but for the rest of the world too. at the same time, they keep ignoring thousands of their own customers for weeks. theyve just silently deleted the announcement and cancellation posts without any official statementexplanationcomment, ignoring all questions and support tickets about their decision. just check the gogs community wishlist  it is the most requested game of december and january. this is just another sign that gogcdpr changed their policy from being procustomer to being promoney. it isn't the first call, but it can be the last one for many loyal customers. censorship can't be tolerated, especially political censorship  i'm sick of this  in my everyday life. so, after all of this, ive got really disappointed. i tend to buy way more games than i have time to play. and i prefer playing on another platform, but i used to buy second copies of the games i like on gog only because i liked it's policy, customeroriented service and wanted to support my favourite devs. but this isn't the thing anymore. i haven't even played 99 of the games i've bought on gog, so, i've tried to request a refund for them. and they refused. gog support has finally answered on my ticket. first of all, they've completely ignored all my questions about devotion. secondly, they've refused to refund anything not a single game from 340 in my library! they've also refused to comment on the bugs and estimated release of next patch for cyberpunk 2077. they've told me to contact cdpr official channels that haven't answered to support tickets in a month. finally, they've refused to partly refund my physical copy of cyberpunk 2077 so i could get the steam version instead i don't want to be forced to buy future addons on gog and use their broken launcher anymore. they've told me that i should refund my physical collector's edition where i've bought it. but it isn't possible after you've opened the box and used the activation code. well, i will be waiting for heavily discounted gotydirector's cutenhanced edition on other platforms then. i was supporting and advertising gog for years. i've bought all cdpr games on release, including collector's editions and versions for different platforms not to mention figurines and tons of other merch. i didn't expect that these companies management will start to wipe their feet on its loyal customers. ive missed the moment when they turned into eaactivision siblings, but as far as history shows  it's the oneway road in this industry. this is the last game i've bought on gog. in the current state, i can't recommend it to anyone, nor i can recommend this platform anymore. i'm disgusted by gogcdpr recent actions and their new priorities. i'm disappointed by the way they've decided to handle situations around failed cyberpunk launch and devotion censorship. their reaction the lack of it on customers' feedback is a disgrace and i regret supporting them so much"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"yes its unfinished game, yes it should not come out on old gen crap consoles, this way cdpr would not have to cut some of the content for pc and have more time to finish it. yes there are some bugs, not as many as hater will make you belive. its still one of the best games of past few years, stories are incredible, main characters are some of the best ever writen characters in games, movies, tv and books. its incredibly fun to play. and judging on how the devs treated their previous games, by the end of 2021 this game will be 2010. didnt have that much fun playing awesome death stranding and i cant even remeber anything close to it since the witcher iii. well, maybe first 2 tomb ryder reboots."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"a good game. there is a lot of interesting plot in side missions, i will hope that with the help of dls their number will increase. hopefully all the rumored cut content will be added. for example, the ability to customize an apartment or car. there are bugs that need to be fixed. but i think the developers have done a great job. i will wait for updates to the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"really. just, really? they hyped up this amazing game, rushed it and then it got completely ruined. it would've been way better if they didn't rush it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"never thought i would lose interest in cyperpunk2077 so quickly, the firstperson view was a mistake, i miss the great cutscenes, the trailers of cp2077 showed the game much more interesting than the actual game, many scenes shown do not appear in the game. the inventory management is totally confusing, you really don't feel like sorting everything in the menu. it's not an rpg, it's more of an actionshooter. firstperson no great cinematic scenes like in the witcher 3. why don't you let us play the ascension? i don't care about jackie, he just didn't interest me because you only played 23 missions with him. the rest is a dull flashback the loot system is a disaster, it's not fun to collect anything at all. and to be honest, reading is annoying at some point, why didn't they have the texts set to voices ? at some point i didn't read anything at all and found it annoying in the long run. i find the texts too small to read on the tv. the world is just a backdrop  you can't do anything great. the side quests were not all good. bugs, glitches the inhabitants are stupid and only do the same things. story was good, but too short and rushed. humour music the german voices is great i also don't understand how you can be attached to jackie if you can't even play the ascension? but to be fobbed off with a boring flashback, i don't get it! that's why i just didn't care for him after that. not even the bugfixing saves the game. everything seems rushed and lifeless. the story is far too short and rushed. the life paths are uninteresting and don't matter, there are hardly any decisions. i'm sorry to say that the witcher 3 is still my favourite game of all time. cyperpunk 2077 needs an improved version in my opinion. too bad about the wasted potential."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"need to balance out all this immature hate the games getting. if you like to feel, if you like to experience, if you like story and immersive city roaming, interesting quests, and if you like to go slow and read every log, think about philosophical implications, explore every detail, then this games for you. there is so much content here. this is definitely one of those sit down, get warm and just soak it in slowly type of games you'd be disrespecting the developers who poured their heart and soul into this if you rush through it. it's not a rushing type of game. go into the game without any expectation and play it for what it is. i am telling you, you will be in love. if you want density, depth, feeling, care, maturity, truth, humanity, then this game is for you. this game tries its best to evoke a certain sense of 'real' that hardly any other game does. give it a fair try, even if it doesn't click with you, i guarantee you will come out of the game experiencing something new. it definitely has that wow factor at times, i haven't really experienced that in a while.  update after playing more i still stand that it is a 1010 game, however it definitely needs more work. this game when fixed and finished is a 1010, but i will give a 1010 in advance to balance out all the hate. biggest issue i can name so far is you will be playing, loving the story, the quest will be setting up for what generally you will have to do. this part is pretty much flawless with minor bugs. however when you actually have to go and do the mission this is where the game took a back seat. many things are unfinished, untested, and have a very scripted, oneway play feel to them. there doesn't seem to be a freedom in how you can do a mission, otherwise it will break. ai as you've read by now is nonexistent, and i will go as to say that there are missions that will break your heart because you thought that the 'fundamentals' would at least work. in fact i have stopped playing after 45 h, since there are things so obviously broken that i almost do not wish to continue, because it hurts me knowing such an epic game has such epic issues. its frustrating and i am honestly shocked that no one up at cdpr was able to stop the game from coming out, however i do not understand their position, i have never developed a game on that scale, or at all, so i do not know of the problems or pressure associated with the project. but damn.... i really wish they hadn't released it, until it was really ready. i would wait and not buy atm, wait until its really fixed. all that aside, i still think this game has a 1010 potential, it has that feel to it. 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-07,"this game was a bit of a letdown. first, the game does have a lot of highlights like the story, characters, scenery and gameplay is not bad. it just feels empty. you can tell this game is clearly unfinished and should have stayed in the oven a little longer. for one, the bugs in this game are everywhere. from graphical glitches to completely game breaking ones there are way too many bugs. the cut content though, is the biggest let down for me. i will admit the hype did get to me through all the marketing material, but i thought cdpr would deliver possibly one of the best games of all time. it possibly could've been if all the cut content was in the game, but the only things you can do in the game are main quests and sidequests, which are both good but i would've like extra fluff like minigames and such. overall, it's not a terrible game by any means, it's just painfully mediocre for what most people were expecting."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"the problem of this game are not the bugs because they will fix them, the problem is much deeper. the physics are a bad joke and saying that this game has a poor ai would be very generous, the city is completely empty of life, not just the few npcs in the streets, you have nothing to do and there is nothing that motivates you to explore it. npcs are completely dump, and cars have literally no ai, so police can't chase you, while driving, npcs doesn't know what to do if the find an obstacle in the middle of the road. not mentioning that they disappear in the distance. and all this is just a little example of what is this game, it's sad because the story is really good, that's why i put a 3 instead of a 0."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"moments of greatness in this game are eclipsed by pure mediocrity. in some of the main missions you catch glimpses of what this game could have been  deep, soulful, leaving you with a sense of wonder at the scale and intensity of this wonderful world. but in between  just plain. side missions lack depth, no replayability, the city is empty and feels unfinished, its all a bit 'meh' and feels like a engine demo more than anything else. this needed another 2 years in the slow cooker to become truly great. i'll play it again in two years and see if its finally the game it was meant to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"cyberpunk is currently worth one or two play throughs, with fun combat, impactful crafting, a fantastic story line, and strong lore readable books. if the developer continues fixing bugs, adding content especially more vehicles, and interactions with npcs like prostitutes and drug dealers, and improving quality of life issues within the menu, then it will become the best open world experience that i have had above botw, witcher 3, and gta 5. i have only played versionupdate 6 of the game. so, imagine a m ix of 1 gta vice 3vice city5 strong story, gangs in the streets, driving carsmotorcycles, crimes, wanted levels, cops, weapons, and a large city with crowds and traffic, 2 spiderman 2  a few kinds of combat quests sprinkled all over the map, 3 outer worlds fast travel dystopian world stores selling food, weapons, or medicine futuristic settingweapons firstperson shooter and crafting break down of weapons, 4 and the witcher 3 crafting and mission style, a prostitute although the witcher had more. despite its issues, this is an amazing open world dystopian experience, with extensive crafting capabilities. the story is excellent, top marks. there are some english language typos throughout the game, but nothing horrendous. the game could use the following improvements bugs, controls especially vehicles, vehicle diversity, ai traffic, crowds, and enemies, npc diversity more drug dealers, prostitutes, etc., increased crafting system power, and menu navigation controller button mapping. a few bugs are pervasive throughout gameplay, but none of them break the game permanently or ruined immersion for me. allinall, worth a purchase."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"es difcil hacer un anlisis de cyberpunk 2077 un mes despus de su lanzamiento. aun habiendo dedicado un total de 60 horas en completar su historia principal y realizar varias misiones secundarias. pero una vez dado por finalizado nicamente habiendo visto uno de sus mltiples finales. tengo que decidir que la sensacin final con el juego lamentablemente se resume en una mezcla agridulce con una cierta decepcin. sin olvidar y obviamente reconociendo el gran trabajo de los desarrolladores. cyberpunk se ha visto sufrido por las grandes presiones comerciales y econmicas. su lanzamiento caracterizado por sus cuestionables retrasos y su gran cantidad de bugs en el juego ha provocado severas crticas que en gran parte han perjudicado la imagen del juego. pero en si esto no quiere decir que sea un mal videojuego. es verdad que la narrativa no acompaa demasiado siendo en muchas partes algo simple y poco profunda. pero con respecto a esto si es verdad que tanto el entorno,personajes y el mltiple contenido provoca una mejor experiencia con respecto a esta. los problemas principales en mi opinin erradican en la incompresible progresin, las mltiples carencias del inventario, las mecnicas absurdas como el respawn de la polica y en muchas ocasiones la repeticin de misiones y objetivos del juego. el apartado grfico destaca por sus amplios y detallados escenarios acompaados de detalles que hacen sumergirte en la localizacin en la que te situas. la gran cantidad y variedad de contenido en un principio puede abrumar pero se le acaba encontrando un sentido y justificacin en el juego. la accin sin destacar mucho implementa mecnicas y opciones que provocan una gran variedad de situaciones y variables a la hora de afrontar los combates. con respecto a la dificultad e inteligencia de los enemigos pienso que est poco pulida. la nica dificultad que encuentras es que no ests preparado para un cierto combate. pero en si los enemigos no te planten situaciones con dificultad y no oponen mucha resistencia. he de destacar la variedad tanto en armas, vehculos y ropa a utilizar. que en un gran grado ameniza y hace ms llevadera la travesa por el juego. tanto el apartado musical y actoral pienso que est bien resuelto y sin destacar muchsimo se nota un gran esfuerzo y dedicacin. ms o menos todo esto quiere decir que no es justo decir que cyberpunk es un mal juego porque no lo es. es una gran idea ms o menos bien ejecutada que alberga un gran potencial pero que debido a los grandes fallos y a las malas decisiones tomadas por cd projekt se ha visto notablemente perjudicado. es una gran pena la verdad. cyberpunk apuntaba muy alto y todo el mundo tena una gran confianza en la desarrolladora que a su vez autoconvencia a los consumidores con su aclamada anterior entrega the witcher 3. en fin a veces estas cosas pasan y ms cuando se trata de hacer videojuegos una tarea que implica a muchas cosas y a mucha gente. espero que pueda tanto la desarrolladora como la industria en general aprender de esta experiencia y que a su vez los consumidores y amantes del medio entiendan la complejidad de hacer videojuegos."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"great game. its a shame that hype ruined it for some of us. even with some technical issues i had fun exploring the world and main story was great. climat and soundtrack playing when driving through night city 10 10. overall solid game, will play again in future to see how developers can grow this title to , hope, some day the game that will live to it intentional hype."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"i knew about the controversy before i even booted the game up due to waiting for the holidays to play it, and wow am i glad i did. i found the bugs to be relatively minor and on my 100 hour adventure in night city i only lost about 15 minutes to dealing with them due to saving often. i am a fan of the cyberpunk genre and going all the way back to 2001's deus ex, i have to say that this is by far the most powerful and immersive story i have experienced in such a setting. the soundtrack, environments, characters and voice acting are also excellent and support a story that literally brought tears to my eyes, which i don't believe has ever happened before. i'd give it a ten but for the need for a bit more polish on the bugs even in the pc version, but damn what a story. i also struggle to give this a ten because there is no happy ending for our 'heroes', only 'hopeful' ones that leave a sliver of ambiguity. again it was a powerful story, but not one i would call happy."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"maaaannn......people on here are really salty! 90 of peoples reviews on here have only reviewed this game only! that should raise some red flags right there. honestly, the game isnt even that bad. i do agree with driving ai and should be able to go into more buildings and explore more, but the game is still fun. i know the bugs will get hashed out eventually, but the game looks absolutely gorgeous. i think a 7 is a fair score for right now. its definitely not an 9 or 10 like some critics are saying though. if they allow for more buildings to be opened up to explore and fix some of the ai, it will be a better game for sure."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-06,"its a very good game, its fun, gunplay is good ... but ... as a rpg lover, i think, this game is less rpg than witcher series. you can choose from three starts, but not even one have some big impact on game at all. base of the game is short, only your activity, role play and side quests can make it longer than 20 hours. world of cyberpunk is nice, but empty. from witcher game series, ill remember many places till i die, but from cyberpunk, i cant even one. npc are same empty as world. cd project worked so long and hard on that game, but they somehow were unable to imprint a human face on the game, like they did in witcher series, what a shame. at the end, its a good game, wait on some sale and it will be good spent money and 2030 hours of your life."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"single completionist playthrough 124.2 hours. i think the low reviews are pretty unfair for what is a large and atomspheric world with some excellent story telling. pros played on a high end pc the world looks amazing. just driving around night city or sitting in a car ride is amazing. i didn't skip any car rides the whole game. the story writing and characters are strong. after over a hundred hours invested i felt pretty moved by the ending. sound track is really excellent. refused did a great job as samurai in particular. cons graphical glitches are annoying. all my video calls had half the person missing. johnny's flickering shroud often didn't cover all of him. randomly stand up with arms streched out while riding motobike. floating gun in jackies head in a moving scene. mechanics bugs. some things just don't work properly eg thrown knives are single use. component crafting is nearly useless without disabling craftting times. mechanical enemies drop components that you can't pick up. some sections are rail roaded and force you into combat no matter how stealthy a netrunner you are. overall, i really liked it and would say its the best game i played in 2020. i think if cdpr had stopped releasing unrealistic release dates and done better qa this would have been game of the year in 2021 but as it is its still a stong game. 810."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"to be honest i don't know where to begin... its been a long time i was so hyped about an upcoming game.. surely since cyberpunk release date was announced i just couldn't wait for it... and because my pc setup isnt the strongest one i knew i would play it on ps 4.. but after the game was released and tons of reviews became to pop up, talking about the bugs and bad performance on oldgen consoles, i gave up my hopes for this title.. until i got it from my friend for christmas... i was pretty pessimistic and afraid about the experience i could gain from this game.. about the performance.... not gonna lie... i was happily surprised.. the performance was ok, surely there were some bugs like characters walking through closed door, time to time dying from fall damage after climbing onto something or the game crashin after few hours of playing... i didnt mind at all.. there was just a one thing that really annoyed me, when part of a story mission bugged and i had to load an old save file to progress further... and even thou i was playing on ps4 pro with 4k optimization on, the game was working pretty smoothly... loading was fast, no fps drops... i don't know if it is because i have pro version of ps4 or just because players are being too dramatic or overreacting... but i didn't find it that terrible as players are saying it is... and about the gameplay.. it was juuuuust amazing... story line is so thrilling, plenty of side quest and the characters are perfectly made... even thou, there's possibility to skip dialog.. i've always listened to every word they had to say... graphics are gorgeous... what i enjoyed the most was driving at night while its raining.. the vibe, the music in the game following the night drive... i was dazzled... lots of cars to obtain, huge amount of guns to craftloot.. the skill tree is extensive... you can go loud or stealth, your call.. so even there were some minor bugs it really didnt matter.. the gameplay absolutely surpassed it... the ending wasn't what i was expecting but its a personal view on things after playing the game.. i really enjoyed the game and i wish you all that you can experience the best of this game as i did"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,i have never reviewed anything on metacritic in my life but made an account just to review this game because it is that disappointing. anyone that would score this game anything above a 5 or maybe 6 if being generous is lying or delusional i honestly don't see how anyone can give this game a good score. there's the bugs that pretty much everyone has heard about as well as crashing but that's just scratching the surface of what is wrong wit this game. the ai in this game is absolutely terrible npcs are absolutely braindead like just one step up from being actual zombies. the police system is the single worst one i have ever experienced in any video game the police will literally spawn right in front of or behind you nonstop and if you want to lose them just drive around the block and poof their gone. i actually was shocked when this first happen with the police i thought i was experiencing a bug but no that's just the actual wanted system they have. enemy ai can be very dumb as well making fun fights a chore. there is no driving ai so not only are there no car chases but npc cars will just sit in place if blocked and cause a massive traffic jam. both cars and npcs will just dissapear right in front of you or pop i. sometimes you will see 4 or 5 of the same exact npc walking together. the lifepaths are basically meaningless and only change the first 15 minutes of the game after that they are absolutely pointless. the story is decent but extremely short for an open world rog this long in the making. the map is filled with repetitive side jobs and other activities that just seem like filler. there are some good side quests but nowhere near as many as witcher 3 had. the clothing system  and is stupid there is no transmog and you character will always be dressed like a hobo. the rog elements are so weak cdpr removed rog from the description and calls it an action adventure game instead. the perk chart is filled with meaningless perks instead of anything actually good. there's also a lot of content that has been cut out of the game just by playing the game you can easily tell there was so much stuff cut out. the crafting system is horrible one if the worst i've ever seen and on top of that crafting feels useless since every five seconds you will pick up a new gun or clothing item with a higher number on it. the loot system feels like a looter shooter and none of your weapons or clothes feel meaningful at all. there's even more problems i could list but i think this covers the worst of it basically this game isn't what was advertised it's a shallow shell of what cdpr marketing hyped it up to be. it's nothing like that 45 minute gameplay video from 2018 the difference is night and day if you don't believe me play the game and go watch that video. the game from the 2018 demo is what i wanted. a lot of people are hopeful cdpr will one day make this game what it should've been but i honestly don't think any amount of patches or free dlc can salvage a lot of the core problems with this game and that's sad to see. in the end cdpr have lied mislead and screwed over cunsomers hell they went out if their way to hide the console version until launch and for all of this they have earned a spot right next to the likes of ea as a developer i will never trust again. i truly do hope they make this game what it should've been but i just strongly doubt it will ever happen.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,they should get arrested for releasing this game. its a scam. after some hours of play i couldnt ignore the bugs and all the stupid ai.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"cyberpunk 2077 is the best and worst game at the same time i could play. i really, really liked that. it is good because you create a character and become attached to him strongly, that this character is you. you and the main character are one whole, the character of the character begins to acquire the traits of your character, often you are v. the plot of the game shows what life really is and in the end you answer the question that you were asked earlier. life puts you before a fact and gives you 2 options for events. and everyone will choose what is peculiar to him. i did not just go through the game, i learned a lot about myself, the game helped me to reveal what i was afraid to answer to myself. it is bad because it does not bind to secondary missions, the main storyline, shouts leave these secondary tasks, here in the main storyline events develop more interestingly. but this is due to the fact that you are very much attracted to the main character, worry and feel what he is feeling. throughout the game, i experienced a shiver of what was happening in the game, which contributed to the very good soundtrack. where it is necessary, it inflates, where it is necessary it will relax, but the game, like life, will not wait and will demand the decisions that you make. in conclusion, i can say that the main thing in the game is the emotions that you get as a result of playing it. if not for optimization, then surely 1010, but alas. overall rating 9.5  10"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,ive never felt so impacted by a games story once before. despite the bugs and nonexistent ai i really enjoyed the gameplay and felt emotional after finishing the game. personally it didn't crash a single time but i had some fps issues mainly in a densely populated place.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"oh the irony. a game that was supposed to be a critique of capitalism turned out to be a parody of it. obviously there was a lot of false advertising done by cdpr, i'm not talking about glitches, the core game has nothing to do with what was marketed to us. i never paid attention to this game until just a couple months ago when they cranked up the marketing, still wasn't intending on buying it. then it came out, and the only criticisms i heard were of glitches, which usually don't bother me as long as the rpg elements are good. well, it's not an rpg, there are no choices, there is nothing to interact with, it's a rigid action shooter looter with a 10 hour story with one of the most boring and uninteresting endings i've ever seen in video game history. but back to the point, this game is empty, meaningless, boring, dead, linear. you want that but with a story that'll grip you a little bit more? go play call of duty. obviously their marketing campaign was so outrageously false that in most developed countries it's outright illegal false advertising. i know there are many lawsuits ongoing right now and cdpr, with this game, is just begging to get ripped to shreds in court. and i hope they do, to course correct from the capitalist dystopia we seem to already be in."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"this is a nowin game. i dont want to waste my time for every step fail in this story not only in the endings. this game is hollow and full of the illusion of choice. top tier  marketing. we are playing games not for depression or have see that that life is fg st without any choices what we can done in real life. as for the plot as a whole, it is very superficial. many heroes have a minimum disclosure of the nature. we are constantly asked to believe two lines in the dialogue, that for example this person was super. just believe us, what the developers tell us. no. romance novels that end abruptly after famous scenes. where is the continuation of the relationship? there are only 23 text messages after and a conversation at the end. in other cases, your loved one stands as a pillar with 3 nonchanging options in the selection dialog. that is all. these are just a few points that have holes in the main plot. not to mention the cutout and muchneeded ingame options that are obvious. and also about the lie of the developers that the game is made in the first person, because it is more exciting. what nonsense! and as it turned out, they just didn't draw a character with a thirdperson view. so they came up with this lie. i put the cons of the game exactly for the lies that were before the game was released and after. and also for what was done quickly and on the principle ofgetting away with it. there were too many empty promises and false pr."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"this was a fantastic game,no doubt one of the best ive played in a while but the bugs,glitches,etc were irritating.i played with my rx 590 and amd ryzen 5 3600 expecting 60 fps at high but this got dogged down to a stable 60 at low and an unstable 60 at  patches are helping massively and the story has me completely immersed and the city just looks absolutely beautiful no matter what you set the graphics  this game was released with no glitchesbugsetc it would be a total masterpiece 1010 but as long as i see my v tposing nude while riding a bike,this is gonna stay at 8"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"gameplay can be really fun and you can get creative with it. the whole hacking gameplay is really cool and useful. story is very good, emotional, dark and engaging. the endings truly give the feeling of an ending of a story. unfortunately when you finish the main story you can't go back to the world and see the effects of your actions on the world, if you want to keep playing then you have to load a save from before the point of no return. the characters, and the relationships are really good. the world is the one of the best things about this game, it truly feels like you are in blade runner and altered carbon. the game has bugs and is not well optimized but that will probably get fixed in the future. the ai is stupid. the music is really good. there is one skill that is confusing and a lot of perks feel useless. there is an illusion of choice with a lot of the choices in this game, not all of them but a lot. in the dialogue the skill checks rarely get you anything special. the world isn't very interactive, like there aren't any mini games or as far as i know you can't buy a new home. this is a copy of my review on steam"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"it's a mess, with a bad user experience. although not to mention the silly and serious bugs, this game has dozens of other problems such as police system, civilianopponent ai, driving system, physics interaction, ragdoll interaction, rpg elements, side quests, custom character, or unfinished features scattered over the game, the combat system is a highlight but incomplete and unlike anything at e3 introduced, in the end, it can not carry a bad teammate."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"extremely unfinished, buggy mess, no amount of graphics and map size can make up how dead and empty night city feels, trying to interact with npcs gets you 5 different versions of  off, or if you're lucky, comments about the weather, they can all be  out of the game and nothing would change, they don't even say anything or interact with you if you decide to save them from gang members assaulting or mugging them, they just cower away and stay there, waiting to die from a stray bullet. npcs run away or cower when v takes fall damage as if there was a shootout. the wanted system is utterly broken even doing a crime in the desert makes the police spawn behind you out of nowhere, if it wasn't sad enough they aren't fast enough to catch you on foot and can't drive cars so escaping is never a problem, not only that, crossing the other side of the street is enough to get them off your back, you can even murder some of them, run away, then come back to the scene and the surviving officers won't remember who you are or what you just did to their colleagues 10 seconds ago, this includes the fabled maxtac squads shown in the prologue, they somehow forget you exist after walking or driving a few blocs away, as a consequence, you can kill npcs, even important ones like ripperdocs with total impunity. npcs have no driving ia, cars routinely stop moving during turns, creating huge traffic jams before suddenly disappearing and trauma teams routinely disappear after you pass them on the sidewalk. trying to go through open windows sometimes makes an invisible force push v 400 meters away while allied npcs sometimes slide through walls and closed doors like ghosts alongside the list of bugs that makes the game feel iike an alpha build of itself, the amount of cut content is astonishing picking any of the 3 classes, nomad, corpo or street kid has no influence on the progression of the story or side quests except for some extra lines of dialogues your v can choose from, and none have any influence on the different endings of the game, which are tied to more or less 3 quests at the very end of the game, the only difference is the prologue, afterwards it's identical. there's huge amounts of cut content no multiple stealth kill animations depending on the weapons used or environment, instead you get only one and there is no differences between stealth killing or knocking them unconscious, they still appear as dead bodies to the enemy and the reaction is the same hacking looks nothing like the preview trailers and is much less complex than presented in the preview the only saving grace of this game is its story and characters"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,al di l dei problemi tecnici che sono solo la punta dell'iceberg di una carente gestione aziendale siamo passati da un capolavoro assoluto di originalit che  stato the witcher 3 ad una banale rivisitazione come tante di un futuro distopico. un misto di vari generi che gli sviluppatori non sono riusciti appieno a fondere assieme.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"a masterpiece imho. just to start with, i play on pc and personally i have not encountered any game breaking bugs. a few minor ones here and there and some stutter here and there, sure, but nothing major, and quite few that broke my immersion. as a matter of fact i think that the game brings immersion to a new level. the city feels alive, the people feel like real people and the quests bring you down a rabbit's hole that makes you reflect on what it means to be human in a dystopian scifi world. the characters are complex, the world has depth and a level of detail i have never seen before. the mechanics of the gameplay is innovative and gives you the freedom to make your character into whatever you want to, without limiting classes or what not. i simply love the game. hats off to all who were involved in making it. it's a fantastic experience."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-05,"they advertised this game as the best game ever and gave so many promises. and now we have just some common game like ubisoft's projects, but i think even those more interesting than cyberpunk. this game has nice story, characters, atmosphere and art design, but gameplay is quite boring, open world is dead, npcs are dumb, side quests are disgusting, and that's really surprising because cdpr created the witcher 3 whose side quests are one of the best among all games . cyberpunk 2077 is huge disappointment and i'd rather not recommend to buy it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"imagine releasing a finished game. i had such high expectations, which obviously cdpr could have achieved no problem. but, instead, their leaders and shareholders decided they needed preorder money now instead of prestige, so they released this broken ass game. it's so good, but the bugs are inescapable, and the number of features they cut from previous demonstrations is truly staggering. most of the arm upgrades are useless including gorilla arms, monowire and mantis blades. so disappointing. hacking looked so much more indepth before, now it's just breach protocol and everyone dies. yawn. i want whoever was factored into the decision to release this game to be fired, because it not only disappointed its investors but more importantly it has disappointed just about every single fan. bethesda releases buggy games all the time. this game is broken, and words cannot truly express my disappointment. this game has been hyped for almost a decade, and then to release it unfinished is basically a  slap in the face to every fan and most of the developers who spent good parts of their lives devoted to this game. actually makes me angry"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"honestly, this game is one of the best game that came out this year despite its problems. the story this game tells is a experience that engrains in my mind for probably the next few years just like witcher 3 did for me, i was completely hooked to the story during my first 50 hour playthrough. this game is a very good game but its flaws are overshadowing its greatness and the amazing content within. the bad the game is very unoptimized where i have a rx580 and i could only get about 4050 fps on mid settings which was very disappointing, most games i played i could run it at over 60 fps consistently on the highest settings even on 1440p. the game itself is extremely buggy where you encounter a bug at least once every hour in some form, personally i have encountered some game breaking bugs where i had to look up the solution for the bug. performance 510 don't recommend playing if you have low end pc even though the game's story is amazing, but when playing it felt very much like a lot of content was cut from the game. an example is that act 3 is literally 1 mission and it was the final mission of the game, where i was fully expecting at least 5 more main missions to play and meet at least 1 main character to do side missions with, but the game didn't deliver that. the different lifepaths was extremely short where it really did not impact the story as whole, but it is ok ig... the story overall was extremely linear much more linear than i had expected, most of the choices didn't matter and the choices really didn't provide any impact to the storyline. another complaint i have in the game is the driving where most cars even the endgame ones are super hard to control especially with the zoomed in minimap that you could not adjust. because the driving is super slippery, you could often hit pedestrians that have the most  ai in modern day fixable. later in my playthrough i swapped to controller while driving and it felt way better and i was able to drive without crashing every few seconds. driving 610 on keyboard 710 on controller when you hit pedestrians, the police start chasing you by teleporting to you anywhere on the map. there's no way to get away from them alive without being in the car if you're under leveled or having a wanted level of 3 and above. enemy ai is acceptable as bullet sponges and nothing more... 310 in ai the good the game's story and characters are the best part of cyberpunk. if you only playing the main missions, you're playing it wrong. most of the good story is within the side missions where it allows you to meet a large cast of interesting characters and have a relationship with them, characters like river ward, judy alverez, panam palmer, kerry eurodyne, and many more. the game really make you feel like you're part of the story and relationship with these people, it makes you feel extremely immersed within the story. this game delivers an amazing story, but most people just play the main story and call the game short and a terribly written game, do yourself a favor and play all the sidequests when you're playing cyberpunk. 1010 in story soundtracks within the game is very well made, they have every songs from every genre in the cyberpunk radio station. within witcher 3 i used fast travel all the time to save time, but here in cyberpunk i decided to not use any fast travel and i found that i was enjoying my time driving around the city while listening to the songs on radio, sometimes i even look forward in driving for an extended amount of time within the game. 1010 in sound the world in cyberpunk is fully realized from just the original pen and paper game. the world is amazing looking with numerous landmarks to see. with even medium settings, the game looks gorgeous and better than most aaa titles out there. 1010 in visuals gunplay in game feels pretty good, where most of the weapons i used were iconic weapons. for me i didn't feel too restricted to what i was using where i really had fun with all the guns i used in game. the cloth in game was some what restrictive to levels, but i was able to buy super cool cloth from stores and customize my character. for those that had complained about their characters looking like clowns, they were only picking up cloth from bodies. perks were pretty decent but i wished that they could actually make it so that you could reassign your attribute points to allow you to make different builds. in my playthrough i was able to try different kinds of playstyle and had fun. customization 7.510 gunplay 810 rpg element 810 almost hitting word limit so... if you have the time and don't got time later and can not get triggered after seeing a few bugs, play this game for the story and experience. alternatively you can wait a few months when they fix the game and optimize it to play it. maybe when they fix the game i would give this game a 910, but rn its a 8 with all its problems."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"i built my first pc thanks to this game and i am super glad i did instead of buying cyberpunk on the ps4. besides a few glitches like floating weapons, weird audio bugs and 2 instances of clipping through the map i have had a relatively smooth experience. even with my entry level graphics card rtx 2060 super cyberpunk looks incredible. night city is beautiful with all of the neon lights, tall  and back allies shrouded in darkness. the city really feels alive. granted the people walking the streets could have been fleshed out a bit more. i come across quite a few really quiet streets despite hundreds of people walking around but this could be attributed to a bug, i'm not sure. gunplay is good not great. there are quite a few different types of weapons. blades, blunts, smart weapons, power weapons and tech weapons. smart weapons are my favorite the bullets are basically guided missiles. power weapons are your somewhat basic kinetic weapons, and tech weapons are.............well i'm not really sure how to explain them. i know you can build up powerful shots by holding down the trigger and does almost double the damage of a single shot. mission structure is pretty good albeit nowhere near as varying as the witcher 3 was but there is still a ton to do and discover. all in all if you are a fan of rpg's or projekt red i think you will find a lot to enjoy here. that said i can only tell you my pc experience, perhaps if you own a ps4 or xbox one i would wait until the game is fixed well enough to at least have an enjoyable experience. like everyone else i am super disappointed in cdpr management when it comes to how they handled the release but i will say i think the floor level devs did a fantastic job creating a world i love being in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"after 116 hours and every ending and almost every quest main side and tarot,and most gigs i can say that i love this game .the story is amazing and the game play too . loved the city and equipment ,skill tree, ways to improve your character . but yeah i need to address what i didn't like. i didnt like the fact that you cant customize your character after create it even witcher has a barbershop so  hope that they update it with hair,tattoo and any options. i like to see the improvements in the body  or a way to transmog skins to use a nice armor but has a nice style. there are some missions that i really dont care  blue ones  and i would prefer more sides or others gold missions than this . i would like to customize my car  i played the game without buy any car  i was satisfied with the ones that i had for free  bikes and some cars . i tested  buying the car called quadra cthulhu but, nothing about cthulhu in iti was expecting some cthulhu toy inside, just like the dog in some cars, . i would like to customize some things in my apartment . i would like to have a better ia with cops that run to you in their cars, not appearing from nowhere and just trying to kill you by feet.. i would like to see a better traffic. night city is really amazing and sometimes i can use some skills to go up in some buiildings, but there is nothing, no secret, no chest, a big space with so much potential.. i love the game but it can be better. it can be more . hope that cdprojekt focus in improve this game , maybe more dlcs than witcher  and after that they can think in a multiplayer to use this city in a better way.. maybe with more vehicles i just saw a boat in one mission and another on the 'beach' but with no action i just saw 1 helicopter trough all the game. the flying cars could be great too  even if you use in the future just to go to the tallest building and take a photo. hope that you listen. and yeah, i am talking about pc its a shame that they released it in a bad way for consoles  hope they add every improvement there too. and using the game mechanics as an example you had max credibility cdpr  but now you need to solve this missions and save your life and recover part of your credibility,because unfortunately i am never going to preorder a game again. hope that you do it"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,not a very good game i prefer fortnite but okay this game is not worth your money
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"if this game was play tested, any notes or critique was clearly ignored. dismantling, selling, or crafting items is a constant chore that i have spent literal hours doing one click at a time. character upgrades are capped in a way that you will have to be very selective about where you put your skill points, and the skill points you get are given out at a painfully slow drip feed. the main storyline is.... fine? the game shines with it's side quests, but it is by no means as gratifying as i was hoping. 128,000 motorcycle is no faster or better handling than the free one you get i saved before the purchase, so this wasn't a complete loss of currency the ai is stupid.... i occasionally trigger police alerts just to level up because you can kill the 3 or 4 waves they send your way without dying fairly easily, then you just walk away after said waves and your 5 star rating just kind of goes away..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"cyberpunk does not change the way we do play games. it didint make changes in my personality nor prevents the worlds hunger. it's a game afterall. with that in mind i'd like like to share my experience with game.  the game looks just amazing. the lights, textures, buildings and characters look great. i was just experiencing the game as it was intended  not analyzing traffic or passerby scripts  and i loved the views. plenty of times i've been just taking photos to admire the beauty of the game.  never before i've experienced such intense and gripping dialogues in game  characters move, interact with items around, gesture and use face expressions  it's just marvelous to watch them.  main story is nice  i really like this much more 'earthbound' story. especially the ending  it was a bit unpredictable and moving.  exploration of the night city and it's surroundings is a treat for rpg lovers  i've not used a quick travel options once. i just enjoy riding a car through the streets while looking around.  fair rpg elements  even tho many would say the game lack's rpg elements  i disagree. you can create your own character and your playstyle  and it does a difference. i was able to sneak past the guards countless numbers of time thanks to my skills  oppening some doors, hacking systems etc. it was very rewardind to find out there's always a route for my style of play during the mission.  dubbing english is really really good. actors are charismatic, full of energy and they fit their roles very well.  nonlinear gameplay  even tho the game might not be hinting that  plenty of times you can change the outcome of mission by simply exploring or taking some side action. the game contains dozens of hidden scripts you may not even find and it's prepared for it  characters will pay attention to your actions. sometimes such actions may even affect the main story later on giving you more options.  as a common knowledge says  at this point of time the game is quite buggy. i've seen flying cars not intentionaly, objects floating around or not spawning at all for example a part of street wasnt there when i was driving so i flew underneeth the whole level and scripts not firing when expected. thankfully nothing that a quick load wouldn't help with.  altough there's many good, funny or interresting side quests to experience and i've made evey single one in the game  there's also some boring and irritating ones  when you have to walk around looking for some stupid clues with a scanner. i've literally spent like 20 minutes walking around like a freak just to find out i've already picked up the clue  i just had to fish it inside the inventory and examine but the game didn't tell me that.  ui could be better  it's still pretty fine, tho browsing inventory is a nightmare. there's so many types of items  especially trash ones you just sell for money  finidng the one you're looking for feels like a mission impossible."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,although it has some technical issues like annoying bugs and glitches but it's still an awesome game and i really enjoyed playing it and since it's made by cdpr i'm sure it'll get much better with the future updates
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-04,"i really want to give it like a 5 because it is so buggy on release, the balancing is super weird played it on very hard and onehitted nearly every enemy, the boxing quest is a complete desaster and a lot of stuff is just not finished  but i also want to give it a 10 because i can't remember a game i played where the characters were so fleshed out, so realistic and i actually kinda miss some of them, now that i finished the game with 100 and every ending. it was a wild 90 hour ride, with lots and lots of bugs but also with so memerable scenes that will stick with me for a while. kerry on his boat, campfire with panam, going to his burial place with johnny, diving with judy and bbq with river  games rarely go as deep and close as cyberpunk does. i wished they would have released it later and in a better state  but this one will be remembered."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"this game is a lot better than people are making it to be. half of it is comparing it to gta v or rdr2 and complaining it doesn't have all those meaningless minigames spread all over the empty world. most importantly it's not a linear story. it has a lot more  significant storylines spread all over the world which feel more alive than any rockstar game ever did and make the world look believable. once you get into the mindset that this game is story driven and every other aspect is subsidiary to the tory  everything starts to click. and from behind the bugs and some lackluster features you can see just how much of an accomplishment this story and this world creation is. in the end all those drawbacks look like minor obstacles on the way to an experience you've been longing for, is it perfect? no. is it flawed? yes. is it all it promised to be? almost. is this a groundbreaking and genredefining experience? yes, plus visually this is absolutely a new benchmark. this is far from a perfect or ideal game. and it clearly prooves that a goty doesn't have to be perfect in all aspects. it's enough if it is coming close to perfect in those aspects that matter most."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,one of the worst open world npc ai i have ever seen. i don't expect red dead redemption 2 level of npc ai since rockstar was in the open world stlye game development much much earlier than cdpr but the npcs in cyberpunk 2077 does not even come clise to gta 3. very disappointing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"worst launch in the history. i've spend about 90 hours. pro great design, characters development, great dialog. i spend hour exploring around the city and getting lost. con this is a incomplete game glitch, crashing, missing basic features that was promised. missing missions. have huge chunk of map only utilized mainly in the city. conclusion this is a 60 alpha. cdpr will likely release fixes or dlc for the missing features, but lying to consumers will likely cause them for the future. by that time the game is completed it will be too late."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"upd. 70hrs, got to the end it is an rpg more in a narrative plane, than in a mechanics still with depth to form your playstyle, it is not an sandbox the world is static, it is not an fps the shooting is clunky, nor it is something new in cyberpunk genre if you are fan, almost all in the game will be familiar. it is not a many things. but. in video games medium there is no competitor to such a colossal interactive encyclopedia of cyberpunk. every thing gig, mission, small side quest is an article about something of hi tech, low life world in which you may participate. alas, you only slightly touch every theme, but is not a purpose of an encyclopedia to dig deeply. maybe the game is not what cdpr promised in trailers. i did not believe in them anyway. but if to rephrase the meredith stout ingame character  sometimes people find themselves in a wrong game, but it feels right. and the city  humongous in scale and meticulous in details, it devours me whole."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"at first, it was a buggy, often unplayable mess. but now, after a couple of patches, and getting deeper into the story... i absolutely love it! its the most immersive game ive ever played. and unlike some other games that say your choices will have consequences, they really do in cyberpunk. and they can entirely change the outcome of the story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"the game has a lot of potential, main story is enthralling, several side quests do some great exploration of science fiction subject with a nice coat of cyberpunk on them. that being said the constant bugs have the sad effect of taking you out of the story, of being fully in. i'm talking mostly about broken quests, dialogs not appearing during conversations, npcs talking without moving their lips, stuff like that. also, sadly, the core rpg system is a bit too simple, badly balanced and not too consistent sometimes with the setting. if one takes crafting to a decent enough level you become untouchable and you can end up being able to do enough damage to kill everything in one shot except for the final boss. the ui needs a lot of work, it's buggy and annoying to use, crafting is a chore."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"the game was hyped up to be something like the witcher series, but what a disappointed. putting all the bugs aside, this game still feels kind of empty, few cars and people in the streets, features that are there, but cant be bothered using. the side quests are fine, though the main story is very short and like a 5.0 imdb rated dramascifi movie."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"now that i have played this game to the end for the very first time, i can say with confidence that this is not a bad game, nor is it particularly good either. the game's story and writing doesn't feel like it was from a team of 43 writers, but instead it feels like it was written by a small group of 14 year olds, trying to make an actually good story, without any knowledge of how to do that. the gameplay mechanics, such as driving, shooting, interacting with npc's were mostly enjoyable, with the exception of melee combat making me feel like i was playing skyrim all over again. the collision physics were also questionable at times, such as when driving at high speeds and bumping into another car, and the other car simply going over you without a scratch on either of you, or you or a npc getting horribly misaligned during a scripted scene. the strange behaviour of npc's would have been comical, were it not happening at all times, during combat, during scripted and emotional scenes and completely ruining them, or just walking down the street. if you are given the chance to not buy this game, then take it, and wait for another year, and hope that it gets improved in that time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"after 130 hours of game time, i can say that this game is really good. i absolutely loved the characters and the story. i played since day 1 and have not had any problems with any game breaking bugs. i highly recommend giving this game e try, you will not be disappointed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"well, i did not catch up for the all the hype about the game, so i don't feel cheated by anyone. it's a really good game, good visuals, great story and a big complex world. sure, could be better, there are some bugs but i don't see them as disturbing. it's like cyberpunk promised with a grain of salt on top of it. with a big potential to be even better with patches and some good dlcs. one thing that i dont see in this game in future is multiplayer. that could be really dull."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"don't listen to negative reviews it's a next gen game and needs a really good pc to fulfill it's full potential! gripping and very immersive, just as the witcher 3 let you feel that mystical medieval world this does the same but in the future ! great game the side missions are really fun as well i'm going for 100 completion! yeah there are bugs but all big rpgs have them and a lot of the bug are funny and have you laughing like a car being launched into the air for no reason. if you like games like fallout and the witcher series youll love this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"i think i've more than earned my right to review this game. i've completed every side quest and every event available in night city and purchased every car. the game looks great, but has lots of graphical glitches just as it was with gameplay. ray tracing adds a lot of visual fidelity, but was not worth the performance cost. gameplay was really buggy, but it doesn't bother me until very late in the game. vehicle physics is good, different cars feel different to drive. it has great potential for a good racing experience, but it falls short with terrable ai who can't even drive well enough on a regular road, so they have to teleport cars behind players to look like they are catching up. the problem with gameplay is its numerical design. players become way too strong way too early, especially with blades and hacking. i can instant kill bosses since around 30 of my play through, yet i didn't even bother to upgrade my gadgets. gunplay is fun and challenging. so if you want to have fun during combat, don't play hacker or blade. stealth gameplay is weird and broken by stupid and unstable enemey ai. they sometimes can't see you even when you crawl in from of them, but sometimes react instantly without seeing you when you enter a room. like witcher 3, cyberpunk 2077 has really good stories along with impressionable characters. there're hundreds of snippets of stories to read, but most of them don't make much sense at all. i can see developer's effort in building an immersive world with lots of little details just like in witcher 3, but it's just too much work. in conclusion, i think cd project red was blinded by witcher 3's success, and chewed more than they can handle. bugs are just a result of it. 7 years is a long time for development, even for an aaa title from an experienced developer. yet they still released the game in an unfinished state. that's just the proof of cdpr being a young company. i originally wanted to give cyberpunk 2077 an 8.5. but i removed 4.5 because i chosed the bad ending. you can feel the developer is intentionally and repeatedly telling you how bad your final choices are through npcs' dialogues. yet i do not agree with their liberal values. but the game still drags me through an almost 2hour long sequence, just to tell me how bad my ending is. it feels like a punishment for me, the player, for not agreeing on their liberal values."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"old timer gamer's 1st review in metacritic because i think this game is getting more negative reviews it deserves. currently have played 30 hours with a low end pc. update 148 hours and upgraded my score from 9 to 10 tldr excellent game for rpg players with many issues that will be resolved with updates. no regrets buying it. update still no regrets and can't wait to play it again with a 3rd character graphics excellent even in low settings there are some bugs like clothing vanishing etc but those can be fixed. update there is so much detail and love put into the characters expressions. sounds excellent, some bugs. ui it's ok but not as good i expected. inventory is clunky and some basic info is hidden. story i have enjoyed it. some good twists that i didn't expect. update your choices impact v's and others story more than you would think. world night city feels alive and somewhere you could get lost in. action this is an rpg with 0 to hero idea so you start weak but as you play and level up you get more effective. shooting is good, haven't tested close combat with a real build yet. update second playthrough with katana focused character and i like how it feels. driving your first car is horrible but when you get new wheels under you it feels good. i personally like bikes in the game more. bugs there are some but unlike huge amount of angry gamers i haven't seen that many and those that i have seen didn't break my enjoyment. update still haven't encountered bugs that would make the game feel bad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"a shallow openworld rpg that falls short of features other decadeold openworld games have. the story and quests are the best part of this game. the rest of the world is a buggy mess forcing me to resort to save scumming, and even think that design choices developers have made are bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"would have given it 1010 but after 1.03 they censored the game unnecessarily and in doing so they ruined most of the immersion. want to make love to your virtual gf or bf well they are nude as the day they were born look down and your in undies. traumatic exp followed by a shower, well v now showers in her underwear. literally tried backloading every version all the way back to day 1 launch and they retroactively patched them all. cdpr said this game would not be censored only to censor it and delete multiple threads complaining about this issue. liars and frauds the lot of them."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"this game is so rushed, broken, full of bad game design choices, and promised features that are nowhere to be seen that i don't even know where to start. i'm actually sad that all these bugs and glitches are covering all the bad game mechanics present in the game, because that's what we should discuss here. bugs will be fixed hopefully but it will be way more difficult to make this a decent game, let alone the game that it should have been according to cdpr claims. in no particular order and without mentioning assorted bugs the openworld is empty and uninteresting npcs are dumber than in a ps1 game your choices of action or dialogue make absolutely no difference whatsoever throughout the main story side quests are repetitive and boring the skill tree is unbalanced and pretty much useless just find a better weapon the loot system and inventory are confusing the hacking system is... meh, chances are you will use two or three hacks at most should i even talk about the police? let us pretend that it's just a bug graphics are indeed amazing more often than not if you have a powerful pc but on the flip side, the game is so horribly optimized. to conclude, just don't buy this game yet, wait at least for the bugs to be fixed but even after that, this will be remembered as an unimpressive effort. games like gta v or rdr2 are just on a completely different level."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"the plot is amazing. i finished the game 2 times and feel unsatisfied, i need the dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"let's get something out of the way cyberpunk is a good and entertaining game. it is also a rushed game with very bad marketing decision surrounding it, though. so it is hard to rate it when you have to do it with broken expectations. i will try. its strongest point is the story telling, both on the main arc and the side quests. the characters are good written and feel truly alive thanks to a great facial animation and superb dubbers at least in spanish. some moments were quite emotional and tbh this aspect of the game alone would make for an enjoyable experience. so if you are here for the story, it will deliver. regarding gameplay, it's quite of a mix. you have a good array of posibilities aproaching combat, but none innovative except for the hability to hack people and gadgets around you, that felt fresh and allowed me to be quite creative. but on the other hand ai is really bad. hostile npcs are always predictable, civilians are decorative, police pops in and out of existence and won't even chase you in their car, not to mention there's no fee system or talking or anything, they just teleport around you and start shooting like crazy. some things that i tried to do but was sad to find i couldn't, were steal cars or shops by pointing my gun at the owners, grab hostile npcs to interrogate them, dressing like a faction to sneak inside their base, join a gang... i know not many games allow for these kind of things, but it felt weird that this one didn't. another big problem is the open world. it is massive but very superficial. most of what you see is decorative or the scenario for a fetch quest. in fact it is so decorative that once you get the double jump you can easily put yourself out of the map and you will have to reload your game. people do not really react to your reputation and really nothing is worth exploring. most cool quests will be given to you anyway, anything you can find by yourself is basicly repetitive crap not worth doing. even as a landscape, this city is ugly. regarding the technical aspect. it was fine with a 1060ti, 45 stable frames. crashed twice in... 72hours. there are some bugs though. flying objects, a crazy visual recognition of items that makes impossible to pick up just the loot you want from the floor, quests getting stuck it could always be solved by reloading in my case, people not talking when they should, subtitles staying in my screen for half an hour... these kind of stuff. i mean, nothing game breaking but sometimes it annoyed me. so, the story was quite the experience and i will remember it and maybe replay with another background i chose street kid, but besides that, it was your regular shooting game in a not so good open world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"on behalf of the staff of the independent california motel, i wish you all sweet dreams. the best game i've ever played. bugs are rare and in most cases they are funny, not even close to skyrim bugfest. visuals are the best at the moment. you can say whatever you want about promises, the game does one and only thing singleplayer rpg must do  it creates strong emotional connection between player and characters. it is so good i am going to start again, just to encounter this story, characters and feelings once more."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"oh yes, it's a very big story and lots of quests and missions. one prologue took 6 hours of the game. very nice the gameplay of the long build game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,an exelent game bugs apart. been playing a lot these days and i loved it. hope all bugs are fixed soon.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"i know. 9 is a high score for such a buggy game. to be clear, im not gonna defend cdpr and how they handled their console edition, launch and delays in this review. i will focus on the product itself. i believe that this game is truly amazing and it raises the bar in the singleplayer rpg genre. and let me explain why story its just amazing, no other word for it. no other game is even close to this level of immersion. its just that good. i have been gaming alot in my 31 years on this planet and i have never experienced anything that could pull my heartstrings like this. beyond that, the game makes you think about your choices and your journey. soundmusic the sound is okay, maybe a little above average. the music however, is just pure eargasm. i love it. graphicsartstyle this is a tough one. personally, i think the world is beautiful. even with a 2070 super. graphics are a tick above average. but the visual immersion and artstyle is leagues ahead of any other game that i am aware of. npc's now this pisses me off. i have seen countless reviewers and comments criticising the npc's. the truth is that this game has just as good and by good i mean average ai as any other game. i have absolutely no idea what the critics bases this on. charcters if you like rpg's, this game will make you care about the characters. to me, they felt almost like real people. some are very likeable. some you love to hate or hate to love  rpg aspect i've seen this criticised alot too, and i don't understand. i have played alot of singplayer rpg's and this is by far the best and immersive system i have ever seen. and its just gonna get better with free dlc and paid expansions. i would say that the game is roughly 50 combat and 50 story. how much it leans to each side is a lot of times up to you as the player. combat turns out that fast paced combat with a lot of customization options and lots of ways to tackle different situations is a good thing? who would have thought. seriously though, it is great for an open world rpg. the negative bugs you already know. nudity a game that markets itself as a mature game, where you can kill, dismember and execute people. there is suicide, torture, and extreme mental health problems, but hell no to naked men and woman in a world that is all about sex, drugs and rock and roll. nudity in a game enforces immersion because, surprise, its natural. and it is normal in real life. its a shame that they didnt include this in the open world and missions. i agree that this game is not finished, and cdpr got a lot of making up to do. but bugs aside, this truly is a amazing game and is only gonna get better. this is a must have for any singleplayer gamer. if you have not played this game yet, but want to, you should wait a couple of months to get the best experience."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"such a pity the game launched with so many bugs and optimisation issues it would have been an easy candidate for game of the year otherwise. even bearing that in mind, the only negative aspects of the game on pc are some mostly hilarious bugs, some optimisation issues few and far between, and the ai of specifically pedestrians, the ncpd, and traffic. barring those, the game is an absolute masterpiece. the plot, side quests, writing, voice acting, music, combat and worldbuilding is cdpr at their absolute best. with a proper postrelease patch schedule and maybe some major dlc to flesh out some questions left open at the end of the game, i can easily see this going from an 8.510 to a 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-03,"this was one of the best stories i have ever played besides the last of us 1 and the choices felt so impactful and important. some of the end choices i knew were big and i struggled with what to choose. all the characters have great storylines and the main missions and sidequests were deep and impactful. yes, it had some super annoying bugs.. but they didn't get in the way of telling the awesome story of v that is there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"what a beautyful jurney! i love every minute of this game. sure, some bugs exist. but they don't have much impact!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,playing this game is like a punishment for everything. missed iconic weapons in main quest? sorry no chance of getting it back. don't have enough crafting level? sorry you can't craft epiclegendary weapons. don't read shards? sorry you don't understand what npc's talking about. there's a lot more disastrous game design that is not related to bugs at all. a game having glitches and bugs can still be a masterpiece if the story and game mechanism is welldesigned like s.t.l.a.k.e.r.. i am afraid this game is beyond repair even if they fixed all the bugs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"is it buggy? yes it is. but not that much. we have seen things like these happen in skyrim or witcher 3, as well as other rpg games. does police mechanics ? yes it does. they need to patch it. everything else in the open world is just good. not great, just good. but you came to night city because cd project red is king in delivering a compelling story and incredibily good secondary missions, in a distopic world. you know from the witcher series they can do great things. and well, they did it. they did it really well. go and live the story of v on your pc. a geforce 1070 or equivalent will be more enough. this is my experience and the game really hooked me in."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"let me start by saying that i totally understand why some people currently dislike the game in its current state. thankfully, my own playthrough has been extremely smooth, with only the minor bugs  glitches i'd expect of an open world rpg immediately after release. that aside, i am absolutely loving the vibrant environment of night city,  am totally loving the characters  stories i am getting involved in. 60 hours into the game,  yet i still frequently struggle to stop playing the game, so invested am i in this story. that's not to say the game is as great as i feel it can be, nor is it currently as great as the hype led us to believe. however, i still feel confident in giving this game an 8.5 out of 10.....with the hope that the free dlc  paid expansions will lift it to a 9.5!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"in my experience, great open world rpgs like the witcher 3 or skyrim are not defined by the strength of their main story, but by that of the side missions that surround it. with cyberpunk 2077, developer cd projekt red has taken that philosophy and built aside from the surprisingly short but still absolutely compelling central quest line that takes you through its diverse urban landscape of the near future, the vast majority of what you can do. in night city it is completely optional, but often still extremely shocking in your this freer form structure is not without its flaws, including many distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves, optional or not, and the choice that it has within it makes cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and simply fun rpgs i have played in recent years. you are in the shoes of v, a mercenary in night city who avoiding spoilers as much as i can ends up with the psyche of a rock star and anti cor johnny, played by the instantly recognizable keanu reeves, is a wonderfully disgusting idiot, even if, to be blunt, reeves' tough performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. johnny's confrontational relationship with v and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they struggle to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. cyberpunk2077gameplaypc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,100 hours gameplay. made preorder. feel i was cheated. it's a stub of what been promised. 1. check 2018 year 48 minutes long gameplay video. 2. compare with what we get in 2020. 3. set game score to '0'. 4. go replay witcher 3.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"i waited for this game since they hinted at it in witcher 3 and i've been closely following any rumors since then. this game was supposed to be the savior. during covid when everyone is miserable and stuck at home, cyber punk was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel. the one good thing of 2020. while i acknowledge the challenges of working at home during an epidemic, it was just the worst timing for cdpr. i remain a loyal fan of their work, but everything about cyber punk is middling and there are no revolutionary additions or even any dimensions that are noteworthy in any way. side characters are uninteresting cliches, main characters are the same, combat is terrible because the performance is so bad i'm getting 15 fps when i get 60 fps on assassins creed valhalla and virtually every other new game. short of spending 2500 on a beast rig that can play this game stably, and due to my own financial challenges during covid, i can't do that. so i'm stuck playing a game that has bad graphics and still has bad performance, a terrible inventory system, terrible samey loot that is just a small assortment of the same few weapon types smgs all the same, ars all the same, shotguns all feel the same, etc. i know cdpr was treading on new ground here. their forte is the witcher and rpgs. fps shooters is not something they've done for that and i can appreciate the ballsy nature of giving fans something they weren't expecting. but at the end of the day i find myself wandering back to the truly great games this gen the last of us, ac valhalla, etc. my desire to play cyber punk is very low. its so buggy that i'm actually stuck in a bug where it quick saved right before i die instantly for some unknown reason. i don't want to start the mission all the way over again its a longer one by restarting way earlier saves. i find myself not really wanting to play it at all. this has been such a depressingly crappy way to end the year. i wish they delayed it another 6 months. i want that nextgen amazing game we were promised. i'd rather have that in 6 months than a husk of what it could have been now. i don't see this series going far. i doubt they'll make another. professional reviews seem bought and paid for, or they are just playing on high end beast rigs and by some miracle aren't experiencing the myriad bugs the rest of us are. i preordered this game the minute it was open for preorders. this has been my biggest disappointment in the gaming industry in living memory. please go back to the witcher 4 or something else. you tried the futuristic noir where megacorps run the world. the fans aren't happy with it. learn the lesson and move on cdpr. you're better than this. you are capable of greatness, and again, due to covid we likely lost a lot of quality due to that. so trying to be as fair as possible, i'll chalk it up to a great game that released at the worst time possible. the final nail in the coffin to seal 2020's fate as the worst year in a long, long time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"the story is very entertaining, but everything else is just unfinished, especially ai."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"the game needs a lot of time to become stable. now i understood the meaning of a moroccan proverb, for the first time in my life after playing cyberpunk, the proverb says   i won't use this, even if they give it to me for free, so, yeah, i can't play the game even if it was free from the start, not discouraging cdpr, because apparently they put a lot of work and effort behind the game, but knowing that it took a lot of time, and they promised us a masterpiece, and a lot of delays, the game was disappointing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"honestly the level of disappointment can hardly be overstated. the game is bad on it's own without taking into account the hype, promises and marketing. a colossal failure that will be remembered for a while. what will also be remembered is the journalists all giving this a 1010. seems kinda sus, it's a terrible game and with the launch bugs it's impossible for a reviewer with any integrity to give it a perfect score. the whole game, launch and surrounding drama is a canary in the gaming gold mine."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"i give 0 points to counter these bought 1010 fake reviews. you can have fun with the game and graphics are good on a gaming rig. but the negative aspects can never justify a rating better than 610. ai is not existent, cars and police are spawning and despawning. the loot and balancing aspect is just ridiculous. you get damage multipliers on headshots with pistols which make them totally broken. the augmentations and skills you get are standard rpg skills like double jump, carrying capacity, armor etc. the hacking mini game is repetitive crap. the world design ist just juvenile with all this nudity and rude language in the world. i suggest to wait a couple of months until the biggest bugs are fixed and then give it a try for a huge discount."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"i waited for this game for two years and finally got around thanks to a friend who shared the library with cyberpunk, i even updated the computer because of it. from a museum piece to an average pc. on gtx 1070, i59400f, 1080p, 16gb ram and ssd it runs on ultra settings the quality of clouds, reflections and something else is reduced to high, as well as the dynamic resolution by at least 95, there are no sags. riding around the city calmly 3540 fps. below 30 fps does not fall, except for scenes that are insanely heavily loaded, they can fall to 25 fps. in general, comfortable at least for me personally. at the time of this writing, i have played almost 20 hours and am in the middle of the game. therefore, i cannot appreciate the plot adequately. advantages the plot. so far, he makes me very happy, there are no objections. it's well written and quite interesting. side quests. yes, many of the same type, such as bring me this, kill those, etc. but, there are many quite interesting ones. for example, reanimation, where i had a difficult choice and i chose to destroy the core. the ending of the quest touched me. so far, i have not found any side effects that would be more interesting than the plot. graphics. many may say that she is not the end of 2020, but rather 2018. but she is insanely beautiful and pleasant. i turn on the photo mode at every step. atmosphere. not everyone will go with this style, but i really like this future, where people lack many moral values, a city that looks more like a ghetto with cybernetic people. transport. yes, because of the physics of the game which is far from the best  it's hard with him. but the cars are quite pleasant to drive, the weight of the car can be felt, how they drift  quite nice. also, almost all transport has beautiful models except for a nonhome meter by meter. weapons. there are quite a few of them, for any color and taste. it is also pleasant to shoot from him i play on a gamepad if that, the weight and recoil are felt. city. i read that many people think the city is plastic, not alive. but as for me he is alive, because i have never yet had the feeling of a puppet theater or something like that. dialogues. they are great. what is johnny silverhand a.k.a keanu reeves, who can  you for no reason. i never missed dialogs in this game. characters. they are well opened and i remember each by name, even those of the side. almost all of the characters are interesting and well written."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"i spent a lot of time in the game. unfortunately, even after its completion, it is impossible to get rid of such distaste for the cut contents. in general, the game features decently prepared elements, but the rest is below average. evidently there was at least a year or two left for the game to be completed. the game is barely able to defend itself when it comes to storytelling and attracts attention mainly due to its graphics. the story itself is actually written very mediocre and not only is it shallow, but all the choices are practically completely illusory. unfortunately, the remaining elements of the open world are already below criticism. the rpg elements in the game are practically nonexistent, and neither is any npc intelligence. the world has nothing to do with the open world because the lack of any meaningful activity makes creating yourself entertainment pointless. driving is like driving on ice. the fight is amusing for the first few hours, and then the stupidity of the opponents makes it completely irrelevant and is only an obstacle that artificially extends the time in the game. unfortunately, despite the nice beginnings and interesting moments in the game, it is difficult to give the game a higher rating considering all its disadvantages. and i'm talking about the pc version. i will not even mention technical issues. and i say this as a fan of the universe and the creator's previous games. just a bad game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"i held out on cp2077 for a long time to avoid the hype, but towards the release date, i got  in. on playing it, the game is not bad, but it's not good either, the best i can say about it is that it's a mediocre medium. it has its atmosphere going for it, yes. the plot is overdone, but still wellwritten, and contains enough twists and parallel lines to give it some measure of replayability if you want to see all possible variations. it has some wellwritten characters, mostly the available romance options. the major characters have actual arcs, going through development as the game progresses, and i have to say the models for these are topnotch too. of course, this kind of attention comes with tradeoffs, more on that later. finally, there's enough lore and filler content to really flesh out the world. shards, newscasts, dialogs, etc. give the world a wellwritten, complete atmosphere. but then there are the negatives. and there are far too many to ignore. first off, the glitches. more than once, i've had the game forget playing a dialog, so i'm left wondering what just happened and what should i answer. then there are the times when people clip into objects in the scene  when it's just a civilian, it might be funny, but when it's the last enemy standing between you and a completely stealthy mission, it's just plain infuriating not to mention when your bike's front wheel clips into something in the road and catapults you 64 stories high which immediately fails your mission. balance is also more than halfway out the window. i had a specific build in mind to start with monowirehacking, with a side of assault when things go loud, so i leveled with that in mind, emphasizing cool. but then it turns out monowire is based on cool but plays off the street brawler skill tree, while playing like a bladed weapon by all accounts meaning it should play off of blades instead, given that it cuts and applies bleeding. hacking can also be blown out of balance, allowing me to destroy entire platoons one by one with short circuitsynaptic burnout combos, while staying outside mission zones to avoid triggering the enemy ai. and finally, the models. while the major characters get detailed, wellsculpted models, the extras get a choice of maybe ten generic models. although the game was advertised with unique civilians populating the city, in reality, everyone is just a combination  model, a generic behavior which consists of walk at constant speed, talk to partner, and stand still looking around and a single sentence to say on contact. overall, it's hard to believe this game has been in development for eight years. it shows an astonishing lack of bughunting and playtesting for its hype and budget, and does not justify its price in any way."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"update game breaking bugs resolved finished the game twice still not recommending it! do not buy. i really do not understand those who gave a 10!!! only reason is getting payed for a review or getting a laugh at people wasting 60 on a broken game!!! it is not just a matter of bugs the game is broken or poorly programmed  do not hope for patches...  ai is daft! enemies just stand still. and take all you shoot. difficulty is based on them absorbing your shots. just get a powerfull weapon and shoot... no tactics needed.  cops appear out of thin air and shoot as soon as you get a wanted status. even if crime is commited silently inside a closed room, you will get wanted status and cops will spawn at your location.  to reset wanted status, you just need to get out of sight, turn a couple of corners, drive away no car chases and you can just return on the crime scene, and cops you left there won't do nothing... yes you can choose a stealthy approach or cyberhack... that is a plus. just watch out for glitches that will ruin your stealth run disapearing walls, dead bodies falling through walls and floor... great story, definitely worth seeing all endings... watch on youtube do not buy. some characters are well scripted and played. realy good job there... just go watch a movie do not buy graphics are good as long as you do not look for details so great visuals, just do not look too close to single objects... but this is no big deal realy."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,people who gives bad votes is because thay don't have a pc but they are still using a console old gen or next gen same game. cyberpunk 2077 on pc is a great role play game.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"tried it through steam, had critical bugs which didn't allow me to play it. downloaded it in gog and regretted spending the effort.i originally reviewed the game about one third the way through, now that i have completed the game, i can provide more details. cyberpunk 2077 peaks about twenty minutes half an hour in and goes downhill from there. the game is bogged down in wanting to be cool and fails at basically everything. the setting is derivative, and a poor rendition of the cyberpunk, or dystopian future. the soundtrack is fantastic, its implementation insufficient, errors mean you get the same track running always. the graphics are good but do not provide any extra narrative, extra gameplay, or additional value. it is just visually appealing. the gameplay is lacking, all the way through. the ai if predictable to the extreme. early on, it would help if you used scouting grenades to identify where enemies are behind cover. later on, you stop caring, and you use tech weapons to shoot through cover where enemies will be. it is a laughable joke. you can go through significant amounts of fights without actually facing a shot from an enemy. the control system if buggy and limited, it was designed for a hand controller and poorly done. you can be in the middle of a firefight and get a narrative section. at which point, you can no longer crouch or uncrouch because the crouch button is the same as the skip dialogue button. you cant double jump or super jump. you are hamstring, just because the writers want to ham fist in some story. it is a joke. other internal mechanics are poor driving controls are a joke, crafting is a mechanism of infinite money and completely devalues ay actual effort on behalf of the player. the script is terrible. it is about as good as the script for jaws. its a joke. and its peak is about one third into the game and goes downhill from there. by the time you get close to the climax, it is just foul. you get stuck in a setting that looks like tron bred with a crt tv, you cant see anything, and frankly, nothing you do during that scene seems to matter, so why the hell is it even there? there are flashback scenes that could not possibly change anything and are of absolutely no value other than giving the studio the  aide of keanu reeves. it is arthouse  with no plot or gameplay value. the missions are bad and repetitive the story almost absent. your decisions have limited impact, and you get told from the word go you shouldnt care. the opening scenes set up what you value in your life and then take it away. you have no reason to continue, none. it is crap. the world feels false and shallow. 90 of doors are locked, and you cant access them under any circumstances. you dont care about the consequences you shoot civilians to steal their cars and have no consequences. but if do piss off the cops, the portal in just out of eyeshot, it is ridiculous, then you run four blocks, and suddenly it doesnt matter, your warrant disappears. the game is full of bugs, critical bugs, hilarious bugs. the number of times you have to reload because of essential bugs is a joke, it is worse than a bethesda game, and that is saying something. all in all, cyberpunk 2077 is a vapid  aid of cool with no value, depth or worthwhile gameplay. if i had to put a dollar value on the game, maybe 20. it is bad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"and after 150 hours i finished cyberpunk 2077, ending the main plot and clearing the map of all markers. as far as i know, i missed a few side quests, but i don't know why they didn't come up. there were a lot of visual problems  from 3040 cases, which more or less spoiled the immersion. apart from uncollectible items, which e.g. fell into a clump of grass, there was a problem twice that could stop the progress of the task  e.g. an armored vehicle landed upside down, or two cars after the race were parked at the distance of the paint coat, which made it impossible to getting in. in my opinion, the plot is 1010, they just need to patch up the game itself. to sum up  everyone expected something different from this game, hence we have such a wide spectrum of opinions  from hysterics shouting that this game is lost and needs to be done completely from scratch, to people who, despite problems, have a great time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"this game is scam. total scam. i am lucky i am playing on pc, this is not an aaa production as we all have been used to like red dead 2 and many other big rpg open world.  ia , we have enemies who don't move, don't react, enemies are just stupid at maximum difficulties.  ragdolls are not credible.  animations are from the year 2000.  collision detection absent. didn't they promised a new engine for layers and clothes?  lipsync is just ok.  vendors are useless in this world. everything looks steged, not a simulation but just staged.  rpg component is just raw and primitive, cd project really exaggerated on customization  do i really need 100 stickers for the photo mode and i can not even craft something for real? night city was promised to be the most believable city in an open world game to date. so that was a f.cking lie. people in the city are absolutely soulless and useless. are we really going to support this ? i want my money back and i'll ask for a refund asap. cd project i am really sorry i bought this game on august 2019, your marketing is not fair and i won't trust you anymore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"it's a fun game with some outstanding qualities writing, soundtrack, visual designs, etc. unfortunately, it doesn't deliver on its promise of being the ultimate next gen openworld rpg experience. you have got to be joking... cdpr deserves backlash over false advertising. compare the gameplay trailer from 2018 to the final game. it's shocking. 80 of what was advertised as a glimpse is missing or severely watered down. what we got is an early alpha. it's insultingly unfinished and technically shallow. a mirage of what it promised to be."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"game is superbly good and i have 0 complaints. stop comparing this to gta because it's an extremely different concept and mechanics. everyone who's a software developer will agree for such a big game, their bugs are very insignificant. also regarding performance, it's freaking next gen game. it is designed to push people to move on to next gen hardware. people just have the wrong expectation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-02,"i felt like i was paying for the limited showcase sequences of the game and the rest was just above average story with belowaverage gameplay performance, belowaverage bugs, belowaverage optimization, and aboveaverage worldbuilding, meleegunplay, and rpg elements. not as good as skyrim but it's like a cyberpunk version of dying light and fallout combined"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"giving 3 for a greatlooking city and the development of some characters. the rest is a bugged, crashing piece of fps shooter, which is nothing it was advertised as. in fact, it should be an example of fraud. steam doesn't want to give me my money back because i played for more than 2 hours, but i'm lucky i live in australia. i'm taking this to consumer rights authority. the game is not an rpg it was promised to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"in and out, it feels like a cd project red game. the stories not obvious and neither are the choices. the story was slow up until you get to know johnny. everything around him, made me curious. if you like the witcher 3, then this game will live up to your expectations. the game has plenty of bugs but reloading the last save would fix 95 of them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"beyond the bugs and performance issues, which i trust will be fixed based on previous cdpr releases, this is still only an okay game and a pretty severe disappointment as a follow up to the witcher 3. the side quests are simplified, fewer, and lack the emotional impact of cdprs previous games. i found myself surprised at the end of the game, with nothing left to do, and very few memorable plot points, whereas the witcher 3 seemed endless in its scope and story. it seems cdpr set out to make a graphic tech showpiece and scaled everything back in order to accomplish it. after all the delays this still feels shallow and rushed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"it looks cool and fun to play but, it has some critical bugs in the game. such as blackout, police spawn, lack of sound, physical engine error, boss not moving, a story that never starts, and on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"of course, the launch of this game was a disaster, and people playing on older consoles are clearly not having the experience with this game they were hoping to have. but if you look at the game as it runs on a fairly good pc, it is actually a very good, even beautifullooking game. there are visual bugs, glitches. but you can go through the game for hours without ever noticing any, usually. most are minor, and don't really break your immersion. and there are aspects of the game that seem rushed, small touches missing at times. like... there is no little sound when you craft or upgrade an item, for example, which is staple for any rpg. it could have used more time in the oven, this game, sure. some things i had been hoping for that aren't there. but there is still a huge game with a huge amount of high quality gameplay, storytelling, acting, dialoguewriting, mission building, design. there is still a lot of atmosphere. it is a great game with flaws, but still a great game. it is a shame that this game didn't turn out to be the total awesome futuristic cult rpg masterpiece of the decade that i and many were hoping it would be at least, not in the state it is in now, but there is a lot of great stuff there. don't play this game on a lower end console, just now, but don't let the negative hype around the very bad launch blind you to the fact that, in spite of it's flaws, this is still a very very good game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"30 hours into the game. the game is very fun to play. some glitches and bugs but nothing game breaking most just need to reload a previous autosave. however i think the overmarketing before the release of the game is seriously hurting the review of this game. freeroaming is basically nonexistent as nearly all contents are in the quests. for example, a building will only be occupied if you accept a certain quest. so while i do like this game and can recommend it without hesitation, i don't think i will do multiple playthroughs unless big changes are made."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"great story, had a fun time minmaxing the skill tree for combat too. night city is a a character of its own  had a blast just exploring and looking at the architectures."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"i never write reviews, but this game was so good that i felt obligated to fully recommend it to anyone. i've played other amazing games, and i hope to continue to play amazing games, but this game will always stand out to me as one of the best. i think people's problem with this game is that they are comparing it to gta. this is completely different from gta in almost every way. cyberpunk is an rpg at its core, not an open world. yes, there are openworld aspects to the game, but they are not the primary focus of the game. that honor goes to the story. the story is truly phenomenal and i enjoyed every minute of it. if you're a science fiction fan, go buy this game right now and stop reading my review. for anyone else, if you enjoy a good, interesting story and have the money, buy the game. you will enjoy it as well. the story is what makes this game amazing. this being said, the game is definitely made for fans of science fiction like myself. while one could definitely get enjoyment from the game without being a fan of science fiction, true science fiction fans will love it. yes, it may not be the most actionpacked at times, but that's completely fine by me. the story is so good that i enjoyed the dialogueheavy missions equally as much if not more than the combatheavy ones. i was thinking about this game long after i stopped playing and stayed up late many nights just to continue on with the story. the characters are all realistic and have depth. it's amazing to see the evolution of many of the characters that you've grown to love since the beginning of the game. the side missions also add a lot to the story. for many of the side missions, i would go so far as to say that they are essential to the main story. they really help you get to know the characters better and open up many more opportunities in the game. the story in this game is truly a masterpiece and i can't wait to play through it again. i also cannot wait for the dlc. this is not a perfect game. why then am i giving it a 1010 if it's not perfect? the story in the game is simply so amazing that i am willing to look past the bugs and unfinished parts of the game. while it could be improved in some areas, specifically the ai, the gameplay is overall extremely good and i genuinely enjoyed most of the missions. combat is fun and there are a large variety of weapons and playstyles to choose from. for my playthrough, i went with a balanced character who was decent at everything. the main story is probably around 2025 hours, which may seem short, but if you actually take your time and enjoy the game you will be able to get lots of hours of enjoyment from it. it took me 56 hours for my first playthrough. i took my sweet time enjoying all of the amazing side missions and taking in all night city had to offer. now the not so good. yes, there are bugs, but they are all fixable. on pc, the bugs are nowhere near as bad as people are making them out to be. this is not cyberbug 2077. if you're overly concerned about bugs, just wait a few months. the game is extremely demanding. and yes, cdpr did lie about the system requirements. i have an rtx 3090, the most powerful graphics card available in 2020. i am running the game at 4k high settings with ray tracing set to ultra. i have dlss set to balanced. i managed to get 45 fps in the city and up to 60 fps in less demanding areas. this is with an rtx 3090. yes, a 1500 gpu, and i still can't get a constant 60 fps. while the game will run at lower settings and resolutions on a lowerend card, you definitely need an extremely powerful pc for the game to truly shine. i know this was a long review, but i truly cannot recommend this game enough. it is a true masterpiece  and i cannot wait to continue playing as the game gets more updates and content and to continue exploring everything this game has to offer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"cyberpunk 2077 is a difficult game to score. on the one hand, the game deserves to be applauded for where it wildly succeeds in its ambition the scale of night city itself. it is arguably a lot easier to deliver a massive open world when these are populated mostly by trees and mountains, or take the form of smallscale replicas of real places. night city, in turn, not only delivers a highly unique aesthetic, but also blows the competition completely out of the water with regards to scale. seeing it will leave you in awe for tens of hours of playtime. other standout elements include sound, music and voiceacting. unfortunately, the remaining components that make up cyberpunk 2077 range from just good to decidedly broken. the game is clearly unfinished. this fact is painfully obvious, in part from the enormous discrepancy in quality between the main questlines and endings, and that of the games many sidequests, gigs and introductory lifepaths, and in part from the huge differences between what was shown in promotional material as compared to what is actually in the game. frankly, it is almost unfathomable that cd project red has opted to show off so much content which was ultimately in such an incomplete state that it has been cut from the game, from trains to planes to destructible environments, and the list goes on and on and on, so i will leave it there. cyberpunk 2077s main storyline is actually quite decent and has a rather good twist, which is only revealed in one of its endings, and many of the games characters are well written, though unfortunately, many of its best characters are rather underutilized. the character of johnny silverhand is particularly wellwritten, and many of the games semiunfinished sidequests arguably wouldnt have worked without his dialoguecontributions. playing cyberpunk 2077 is such a mixed experience because it is painfully obvious where cd project red had intended to take a particular questline or gamemechanic, but ultimately didnt. you see the potential around every corner, and so you end up continuously disappointed with what is actually there. cyberpunk 2077 tries to be everything for everyone all at once. as a consequence, the game ends up a master of none, leaving each type of player wanting for more. those that were particularly interested in treating cyberpunk 2077 as a bethesdarockstar style sandbox game will be severely disappointed by the games npc ai, broken driving mechanics, and the general lack of interactivity. those looking for excellent combat mechanics will probably find the game unbalanced and combat encounters a bit meh. people such as myself, who were hoping for exciting character arcs and plots with impactful dialogue choices, will be severely disappointed by how few resources appear to have been allocated towards this aspect of the game. its a game about factions that doesnt really let you side with one, and in so doing, make enemies of another. youve got arasaka and militech  the allpowerful corporations of its world  both of which feature surprisingly little. you have   another major player  which you only ever really interact with once. you have numerous gangs, but never get much of a sense of their individual identities beyond some very superficial cues. clothing styles dont matter at all. you make a lot of dialogue decisions, but hardly any of them have any consequences outside of the questline which they pertain to. most disappointingly, you cannot complete most questlines via dialogue only. dont expect much replayability. i have played this game for approximately 75 hours. 50 of those hours were highly entertaining. despite of its many shortcomings, i can't really think of another game released since the witcher 3 which has been able to keep me entertained for so long. despite its flaws, cyberpunk 2077 is still ahead of its competition that is, creators of rpgs and immersive sims not creators of sandbox games. thus, as someone who is almost exclusively interested in scifi and fantasy rpgs and immersive sims, i consider cyberpunk 2077 to be the most interesting game to release since the witcher 3 though cyberpunk 2077 doesnt quite reach the level of quality of its predecessor. this, i think, speaks volumes of the sad state of rpgs in the 2010s. most video game companies are content to release a slightly improved, reskinned version of the same game year after year. after all, that is what is most profitable, and rpgs are expensive to produce. at least, cd project red reached for the stars, though they didn't quite get there. cyberpunk 2077 still has many bugs. in my case, playing on stadia, none of these bugs were gamebreaking. if you're a fan of rpgs and immersive sims, cyberpunk 2077 on pc is well worth its price of admission, as, even with its many shortcomings, it is still superior to most other video games of its genre. 8.510."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"cyberpunk has a good storymode with some flaws in continuity about your choices. ai is a mess, if my expectation there is one. the city is amazing very detailed but npc's and transit does not fill up the emptiness. they could done this game much better than there is. and they failed a lot of promisses. like in the trailers and description. where are the random driving shoot? the city is dead, respawing npcs over and over reality this game it is in a low average of games that i like just because of the theme, or else this is a clich. once more we can't trust what they announce. it's always the same lies...."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"from witcher 3 to this mess . i'm not even concerned about the bugs, it happens with every major release. the thing that bothers me is the lack of detail and all of the cut content.... take a look at the 2018 48min gameplay reveal walktrough, fing half is missing. so much promise this game had just to be released to early and feel lackluster in everything except some characters and dialogue. hell, even the major decisions you make from your starting path has no effect whatsoever. looks like ubisoft has a contender"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,the best story i have ever seen in a video game. it's good movie or book level.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"some what enjoyable game, however it is no rpg, and nothing like they promised  any cool features that made this game seem next gen were either cut to made useless. the ai and physics in this game arent even as good as examples from over almost 2 decades ago. cdpr falsely advertised this game and have many quotes you could pull up to show this. this game is average at best and comparable to an ubisoft game, however i have enjoyed titles from them more then cyberpunk. for cdpr to go from witcher 3 to this is a massive fall, however its the lying and the false advertising that has made me lose all respect for them. personally i think they should even be offering refunds to those on pc who pre ordered or bought on launch day, and who have played over 2 hours. seeing as its a hollow shell of the game promised to us by a developer we had trust in. like i said its a somewhat good game, and i would purchase on a sale in a years time once perhaps its more polished and has more features, though i think its unlikely for them to overhaul the horrible ai and physics, and add in the majority of the cut content, so i doubt it will ever be the game we were so sold on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"absolute trash!! it is nothing like it was advertised!!! this game is not only full of bugs but it lags content, it only has 3 chapters and the first chapter is the prologue!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"yes, there are bugs. yes, you may have to reload a saved game at some point without losing progression. and yes, it's still amazing. totally worth it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"it's not as bad as some people have said. i've played about 36 hours, and its crashed 3 times and ive run into bugs that have caused me to reload twice. mostly just little glitches here and there. it's also not a great game either. even though there is this incredible open world that people talk about, most of the main story is on rails, and a lot of the side quests are repetitive. plus the main story is not that great. it's basically just an updated version of deus ex, with more npcs and cars and graffiti, but the same linear storyline that you are expected to follow."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"imho the best game to date regarding storytelling, worldbuilding, immersion, soundtrack and characters, if one let's it tell it's story and not rush through. minor bugs and some qol stuff missing, but nothing major. very fun gameplay and great graphics, too!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,.     .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"there's a lot to love about cp2077. and i am confident the few shortcomings of the pc version will be addressed soon enough. it's a stunningly goodlooking game. with raytracing on it is simply the bestlooking game i have ever played. the missions are a lot of fun to play. hacking works well. gunplay is awesome. braindance is interesting and provides even more diversity to the gameplay. and i also love nitpicking about my equipment. plenty of ways to upgrade and change things up and built your character just the way you want. so, for the few shortcomings i basically only have two 1. the streetwalking and car ai is very basic. while the world looks and feels alive, the illusion quickly breaks when you try to interact with anything in the world while just roaming about. cars feel like they are riding along train tracks and can't go around simple obstacles. and streetwalking npc's feel robotic at best. walk into them and you'll get a look out! and that's it. 2. there are some annoying bugs right now. i haven't had anything gamebreaking. but small stuff. for instance, you can set keys for both crouch hold and crouch toggle. but they are bugged out if only one of them is set. so if you set crouch hold and not crouch toggle it will work when you set it. but when you restart the game that button will now be crouch hold instead, even though it looks right in the ui. running is equally bugged. you'll stop running when you stumble into something. and if you jump while running and then release shift, it will keep running, even though you haven't set run toggle. the first will take a long time to fix. if cdpr even wants to fix it since it's not actually broken, it's just very rudimentary ai for the world simulation ai. and comparison videos with even ten year older gta games makes cp2077 look very dated in that regard. a pity since the rest of the game is great! bottom line cp2077 is already a great game. but they should have postponed it to summer 2021 and made an effort to breath more life into the otherwise stunningly beautiful and detailed city. and, of course, they shouldn't have released the lastgen version at all at this point. that was a major misstep that will forever taint cdpr unfortunately. luckily i have a beefy pc that can easily run the game. and the potential for a masterpiece is there. but it needs a bit more work for those last details for it all to come together perfectly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,best rpg game since years. most of the people who negatively comment this game never played it. just watched a patostreamer hateing cp77 for no reason for youtube views
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"this is awesome game. please do not listen that  in internet. this game deserves a highest rate at least fo atmosphere,open world, quests and especially for the final!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"jeu excellent, une narration prenante et des des personnages superbement bien crit. dommage que le jeu sois bug beaucoup que ce que je craignais . j'attends donc avec impatiente les nouveaux patchs et dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"often buggy, always dull. mediocre in every regard. combat is clumsy, dialogue is uninteresting, choice is an illusion, and the open world is extraordinarily shallow. even with maxed graphics and ray tracing settings, the visuals are inconsistent and at times disappointing. cyberpunk 2077 feels like an immature effort from a studio with more money than experience. i'll revisit it if it gets a serious overhaul."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"best game 2020. yes, this game have a lot of bugs, problems with optimization but i really very like this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"seeing all the negative media following its release, the mention of bugs and the game being unfinished i was concerned. but having now played it just over 30 hours i've only had one crash and yes there are bugs seen 1 t person and 3040 floating objects like cigarettescollectiblesetc, but other than that i'm impressed with the game and i've not had any game breaking issues, so it sounds like that's the console versions. with the sheer size of the city, the number of quests and the amount of customization you can do on yourself, clothes, guns, etc i'm not surprised it got delayed, nor that there were some teething problems at release. but i've been playing 1st3rd person pc games for over 30 years and this is one of the best and most enjoyable games i've played. its not perfect and its not witcher 3, but then it was never going to be as witcher isn't a densely populated city with gunscars, but i've been impressed with all of the missions, particularly the main story ones and found them enjoyable so far. is it what was promised so many years ago? no its not, but its still a good game but definitely worth playing as long as its on a decent pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"when this game works its great. i play on a pretty high end computer and have personally experienced few bugs or glitches. those i do encounter are mostly animation or item popping, which can be tiresome, but definitely not game breaking. as stated, when the game works at its full potential its a fantastic game. the feel of the city, the atmosphere, the story, the vast amount of quests and content etc. combat felt wonky to begin with, but after roughly 50 hours its butter smooth, so its something to get used to i guess. overall a great game, just to bad that lastgen console players cant experience. but this is a pc review, so a solid 910. sidenote i've seen quiet a few console reviews on this pc review, please keep the reviews to their respective platform. i acknowledge that there are bugs, but please do not bring console specific issues to this review"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"the immense size of night city is impressive, the cyberpunk atmosphere comes across nicely. unfortunately, the main story is only mediocre and a number of glitches regularly break the immersion. all in all the game lacks finishing touches. the music is excellent, though, so bonus points for that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"first off, the story, the graphics, character creator and the world are at a level that's rarely seen and i've grown attached to a lot of cyberpunk's characters, locations, songs and atmospheres. although the game includes a number of good ideas, the rpg, stealth and shooter systems are not the best in the genre. shooting is good, stealth and hacking is fun, driving is okay, etc... but all systems in the game sadly miss balance and polish. in short, this game needed about 612 more months of work, for balance, polish, technical optimization and the implementation of missing features. it's a shame the game got pushed out too soon. i for one would have gladly waited for a more complete experience. still, don't let the hype distort your experience, the game is great and i'm loving my time with it. i can't wait to see what cdpr does with this ip."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"i cant believe this game has so many bad reviews. characters, story, city, design, music and even more things are so impressive that i cant even compare this work to other, because its so good. i really dont get it why a lot of people nag about bugs. they arent that bad. if i could buy this game second time and give creators more money from my pocket, i would totally do this, cause this game deserves really big attention and warm words. the best game ive ever played."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,i don't know if it was the terrible glitches or the boring game but i just couldn't enjoy this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"it actually deserves 910 because there are no perfect games and cyberpunk 2077 has some unfixed bugs as of now. however, those bugs are insignificant and not frequent. so bugs are not the main topic of discussion. cyberpunk has a great story, great atmosphere, and real next generation graphics. i love this game no matter what others say! english is my second language"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,should have been named cyberbugs... the game is unfinished it looks like an alpha stage. releasing it on ps4 and xbox and saying it will turn well was a big mistake and stupid idea from cd projekt. the witcher has a really well written story but here in cyberbugs it feel like a child wrote the story. what we were promised was a lie... a lot of features missing. cd projekt is definitely competing with bethesda in term of bugs here or wait they actually win... worst. here a little list of bad stuff   optimization are terrible on pc.  lod's popping visible.  tileable textures visible and poor.  random tpose on character.  npc's walk under the map or inside a wall.  npc's on the street are linear and boring. there is absolutely no life.  gameplay of the cars is garbage.  v is absolutely not interesting.  cant rechange the look ingame.  cant interact with npc's.  you can glitch under the map.  cant even concentrate on a mission without having the phone rigging constantly.  stupid idea in the mission...  when you call your vehicle there is a high risk of collision with other npc's vehicles or maybe you could see it fly up in the sky or turn in circle.  big empty lifeless world.  bad coding.  lod 34 visible closely sometimes.  imposter of the vehicles from far look so dense but once getting close this density is away make no sense.  ai act really stupid... fall on body. doesn't hide and stand in the middle. go left to right rapidly without knowing what to do. keep talking even when dead...  you will have to reload your save a lot because some mission bugs and you will not be able to finalize it.  sometimes falling from a really little high will kill you instantly...  invincible boss or npc.  you are invincible suddenly at 0 hp.  entering your vehicle could sometimes take you for a fly in the air.  lighting issue in dark area.  cant rebind every shortkey.  flying object in front of npc's.  missing object.  missing dialogue.  mission are boring even watch dog has better missions.  hacking is not well explained and really badly designed.  braindance are not interesting and irritate the eyes. i might forget some others shame... as the list is huge. the only positive side of this game is the art direction and the lighting design. this game shouldn't have been release.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"ps4 pro  buggy but a great game. gonna star my second playthrough after the promised updates are released. i'd like to give 8,5 but ye..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"my one line summary of cyberpunk 2077.... it's mass effect 3 the sequel. tldr points... 1. the game is structurally flawed 2. your in game decisions are largely meaningless in the grand scheme of things 3. it's pretty to look at, if you've got top tier hardware 4. there are many broken or unplayableunusable elements 5. there are lots of bugs so you're paying to betaalpha test this... perhaps in 6 months to a year it might be better longer commentary for me this game breaks the cardinal rule of rpg's  action rpg's in that your actions in game should have real meaning... and for me, or at least in my experience i see that they don't. it doesn't matter if i played everything and i did 90 hours or if i'd followed what most of the mediayoutube reviewers did and played the main story etc 20ish hours... at the end you're ultimately presented with a single choice... there are paths to this choice which are unlocked by what you played but regardless of those paths, they all converge to a single binary choice... just like in mass effect 3  how would you like to die my gold standard rpgarpg is mass effect 2... because in that game, if you play it just right, make the right calls at the right time, you can save everyone and have a happy ending. it's not easy and i failed a few times... but it is possible. and cp'77 would have the potential for this if the writers had deemed it thusly. it's a factor of two possibly both things... time or . i get the distinct impression that they were rushed, that they didn't have the time they needed to make this what they claimed it would be.... it certainly wasn't shipped when it was ready, that much is clear. but there were so many opportunities for the story to be better, that i have to wonder if these were deliberate decisions to take a large dump on the player from a great height. opportunities to merge with your decision in a more compatible way, for the relationships that you choose to pursue to have real meaning, rather than just another check in the box. i chose to romance a character, and apart from the quest line which lead me to the conclusion of that romance, that was about all the interaction i had with that character... there were so many times it could have been woven into conversation or into decisions later on... but nope. those of you that played the witcher 3 know there are ways to get the 'bad' ending, and the 'good' ending... for me all the endings here are terrible because i feel that basically no matter what i did in the game, my end result wouldn't have changed... ultimately i'm indy in rotla. i want to believe that the writers weren't trolling us... but maybe they were... using hope as the carrot.. i also feel that there are great parallels with the matrix as the story uses hope and choice like a carrot and stick... they're both an illusion. hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness the architect. we are lead down the path that there is a way out, and then you find very quickly that is just another form of control... that ultimately your choices are meaningless. the game is structurally flawed imho... there is no reason for it to finish the way it does, and really i can't understand why cdpr chose it to be this way... there is no reason that you can't persist in the world after the main story line is complete... why the inevitable dlc's and expansions need to be shoehorned into the story before the p.o.n.r.. i look to gta5 for this as a persistent world that doesn't have it's main story as the 'be all and end all' of the world.... no amount of patches will change this... as for technical things... the game is a mess, there are bugs everywhere, the code is grossly unoptimized and a lot of the qa process was either rushed or simply not done. i say this as a software designer and tester not games... there are things in this system which are wholly unacceptable but were clearly deprecated in priority to simply get it out the door. even though this is a pc review, you can completely see why sony have removed it from their store. i'll finish with some good points... it's a pretty game when it's working, night city is amazing in it's scope and concept. however, the execution is poor. i don't need to revisit others comments on how laughable the npc ai is. but conceptually it is a visual spectacle. i have taken many fantastic screenshots with photo mode which i really treasure in conclusion... i feel disappointed and let down. i waited 8 years for the game, and really hoped that it would match the output that cdpr had achieved before. put aside the technical elements that can be fixed, the game for me is devoid of the heart that made the witcher series... and it didn't need to have that missing... as snake from the simpsons says... close but no donut cop.. such a shame"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"i see hate and anger in a lot of comments. but the game is one of the best games in the last years. the problem is that cdproject lied about the hardware requirements. you need at least a 1070 gtx to play it without a bad user experience. i have a good machine and i did not found any bug. if you have a good computer, play it, you will enjoy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"takes things from other games, but don't do them as well. i didn't really follow the hype leading up to the release of cyberpunk. only ever saw a few images and maybe minutes of a trailer, and keanu reeves showing up on stage. thought i'd pick it up and try it when it released. with expectations so high, i figured this has to be a great game. cyberpunk takes gameplay aspects from a few other big titles. the open world mission based progression from gta. the stealthaggression fps combat from far cry. and the level up perk dialogue options from fallout. but each of these lack the depth from its' original counterpart. the open world in cyberpunk a beautiful, and reasonably big. but the traffic ai, the law enforcement, and the pedestrian ai don't feel the most organic. pedestrians would reply with the same few things whenever you spoke to them. the things you could do were also quite limited in the city. as far as i knew, vehicles you could drive didn't have that much variety as well. bike, car, or suv. driving around in night city was laggy for me, but maybe the problem could be fixed with a better pc build. the game let me approach combat either with stealth, or guns blazing. i love stealth, and that's what i attempted at first. but this proved to be problematic. scanned objects turned into a jumble of mess on my screen with random objects overlapping human enemies. the game intends for me to hack a radio to distract an enemy, but it takes me some time to actually align my cursor with the radio to hack it, making sure it's not the dude i hack. hacking to distract enemies is a cool thought, but it serves the same purpose as throwing a rock to get enemies to turn around in many other stealth games of this nature, and it brings out the same effect with much less tedious work. i soon resorted to just going in guns blazing, as stealth became tedious and not fun. most of the time, i'd be noticed for really stupid reasons. either they suddenly turned around right before i could get close enough. or the stupid double tap dodge input screwed me over. at times i'd tap the direction keys to slowly get closer, but that input combo is also for quick dodging, which means i'd accidentally blow my cover. the perk tree is enormous. like way too big. the only way i see anyone can even come close to completing it is if they do every side mission and take on almost every random street conflict. it's not necessary to level each perk, but i can't imagine anyone being able to do it unless they are a hardcore completionist. the dialogue, voice acting, and characters were great. although, there were many characters i wish had lived longer. i love it when games or shows kill characters, but i really wish cyberpunk had kept some of them for longer, as i grew attached to them. really wanted them to stick to, at least, until near the end. the story was interesting. mind transfer. but it's nothing i haven't experienced before. soma and the observer come to mind. as well as movies like source code, and the matrix. all three arguably portray it better, imo. but cyberpunk did tell it in a fascinating and unique way. having johnny around questioning my every move was interesting, and made me think about my morals, which side i was on, and what i should do. all in all, i did enjoy the game. but it's nothing i haven't experienced before. it's like cd project red tried to mesh together a bunch of the popular open world gameplay aspects together, but the result is just an average of all the big games that perfected the formula. the futuristic cyber theme definitely gives the game it's identity, albeit only visually."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"a game of my favorite genre from my favorite developers with my favorite actor. there are almost no bugs. the game does not crash unlike rdr 2. main story 1010. side quests  910. references  1010. characters  1010. music  1010. graphics  1010. guns 1010. gameplay  1010. optimization  710 better than andromeda, mankind divided and skyrim. driving  910. endings  710. game  910. my favorite game, but with reservations. 150 hours."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"this could be the next skyrim. or maybe closer to vampire the masquerade bloodlines. the story, and voice acting are amazing. the graphics look stunning. it's just beautiful. but there are some bugs. i won't lie to you. it's nothing compared to game like vtm, or even close to how broken skyrim was. but there are a few wrinkles to iron out. only other thing i will say is adult content! and i don't just mean the nudity. this game is not got kids! or even some adults.. and i love it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"look, i know people gonna disagree with me here but to be honest, i enjoy this game a lot. the story is really good and the side activity is really good to, i like so many of them and some of them are really interesting, but the combat is kinda average to me because the ai is somewhat a little bit stupid at times and the driving physics is meh. and the suspension of disbelief in this game is oooohhhh terrible, like immediately after i get a wanted level, cops is spawn right behind me, like wtf man?? and the setting, night city. i read the review that night city is superficial as a setting. at first i don't believe it but afther i play for a while, i kinda agree with that review. for the characters, well, i love jackie but i don't really like johnny, he's kinda like an  almost all the time. the soundtrack is good... i don't usually listen to hiphop but the music here is actually good to listen to. the only thing that annoys me so much is well... like everybody else, bugs and glitches. some bugs and glitches are funny to watch but others are really frustating because sometimes i can't progress the game and the optimization is bad, the game crashed several times when i played this game. but most of the time, i enjoy this game, i got this game around 45 cheaper yes but i never regret buying this game, i believe cdpr gonna fix this game just like the witcher 3 before remember that game is buggy too at launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"i really liked the story but it could be the game of the decate. it  to see how many oportunitys cd project missed on making this game greater. many bugs, glitches, errors amd dull gameplay on some areas tend to ruin a perfect experience, but, as i was playing on pc i ran on a very small quantity of bugs, but i could tell that the game wasnt quite ready yet. but, nonetheless, for me, it was the most fun game to play in thos wreck of a year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2021-01-01,"although i haven't experienced many bugs or technical issues whilst playing like many others have the game is still a disappointment, i mean it was always going to be given the hype but i expected it to be better than it is. there is some interesting side quests and the main story is ok but the vast majority of the things you do in this game are very similar, all the areas start to look the same and most of the missions feel the same as well. the city looks stunning from afar but the more time you spend in night city the less it impresses you, it doesn't feel real to me, the immersion just isn't there. this isn't a bad game though by any stretch of the imagination, i'm having a lot of fun playing it, customising my character, trying different weapons and attachments, choosing my cyberware and using hacks. i just wish it was more of an rpg."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"hello, i'm absolutly not a paid corporate shill and this is my unbiased review for cyberpunk 2077 cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece of video game narrative. nothing else even comes close. the story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never fun. it is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. in a medium where everything is john wick, cyberpunk 2077 is schindler's list. and just like that film, there were times when i wasn't sure i could keep going. it is a relentless emotional assault that i suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. the game is a work of art  every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. it is astounding. and frequently beautiful. with moments you never find in video games. but i cannot overstate how harrowing it is. it feels like 2 seasons of the darkest tv show you'll ever find, and it frequently better than most tv on the air. that's saying a lot. i think it is an important game. it tore me up, and i will never, ever forget cyberpunk 2077 is a game that will change you. in short, cyberpunk 2077 put me through hell. i did not enjoy it. i wasn't supposed to. i was affected by it. like no game before. i am in awe of it. i am recovering from it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"this games story was amazing and so were the characters. the world was aweinspiring and always found myself to stop every once and a while to look at the view. now to the reason why i am taking 2 points off after saying how amazing the game is. lots of cut content and bugs in my experience, i did not have many bugs, only a few minor bugs and 1 bug that made me restart the application. first, lets talk about the cut content. there is lots of cut content ranging from minor things like wallrunning to major things like police a.i and powerful mercs that come after you for causing to much chaos and dialogue choices that matter. not to say there aren't choices that matter, just very few mostly at the end of the game. now to the bugs and stuff like that, there are a lot of bugs in the game, although it varies from person to person. in my experience i didn't encounter a lot of bugs like i stated earlier in the review. from what i have heard it appears most bugs and issues happen to people with higher end pc's ?. but all in all, this is an excellent game people should experience once its patched. this is my first review so sorry if its all jumbled up, but i hope this helped you decide if you want to get the game or not"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,from a game that could be so much it is disappointing that it was released in this state. despite a phenomenal storyline with charming characters and side quests the game feels like a early beta version. there are major bugs and visual glitches but to me the most annoying fault is the lack of polish in the small details. one of the selling points was intelligent npcs that would support overall game immersion. this is just not true. the npcs are genuinely stupid like skyrim bad and hold the most glitches ive s the small interactions like teleporting into cars and missing voice lines that never fail to break the immersion of the otherwise beautiful surroundings. also the little physics details that games like gta have incorporated so well are missing and that is disappointing. that being said i absolutely love the majority of the game. v is not just a likeable character but almost becomes an extension of your own personality through the dialogue and action choices. the side quests are fun and there are some great references in there. hopefully things will come together more as updates a are released but so far im having a blast! decisions and
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"great game in my opinion. yes, there are more glitches than i'd like, and yes, it has clearly had some smaller features cut from the game from now. but during my 60 hour playthrough i haven't experienced any instability or 'game breaking' bugs that others are complaining about. the graphics looks amazing, excellent use of reflections and lighting effects as you'd expect, combat is fun there is a good balance of 'straight up shooter' and more intricate features like quick hacks once you get used to them. mele can seem a little hectic but that's no different to any other first person, open world game. story has been engaging and had my glued to the screen. side quests, although a fair amount of 'gameplay' repetition there is only so much a game can allow the player to actually do give decent variety to the game with enough context to not feel like a hollow 'here is a bounty'  go to quest marker etc. this i feel is similar to the witcher 3, just using a phone instead of more individual npc's obviously that is slightly less immersive but great for player convenience. diving is a bit tricky, vehicles tend to go very fast very easily so i miss a lot of corners when using the small mini map and slide easily, however this doesn't offend me and is quick and easy to travel around. regarding all the controversy, it isn't perfect, they shouldn't have released it on the previous consoles. on pc it is very demanding i'm playing at 1440p with a 1080 ti for context, there are plenty of bugs, the only one that bothers me at all is things popping in and out, particularly when driving fast. to be clear i do not find that this ruins the game at all and is not that frequent, but that's the thing i notice most. i trust hope that cd projekt red are working on all of these and cut features, i'll then play it all again! in summery, it's the most compelled i've been to play a game in quite a long time. despite any short comings i've enjoyed every moment i've played thus far. i'd give it a solid 10 with the small glitches fixed, but a 9 for now. i find that almost all of the bugs are the same things you see in all other large open world games. that isn't to say it's acceptable because others have them, but i have been getting the impression that comments and reviews have been needlessly harsh on cyberpunk thinking that all previous games were perfect, and forgetting the sheer scale of this game. if you can wait a little, give cd projekt red some time to fix bits and bundle extras and for the new gpu's to come back in stock!."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"damn, this is the real problem of overhype. most people who bought this game thought that they were going to get gta 5 level openworld and etc, but dang, were our expectations crushed. the amount of bugs in this game is not tolerable, especially for a triplea game costing 80. don't play this game right now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,so much missing content and half baked world. the lack of rpg elements leaves anyone wanting a full experience with a lot to complain about.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"it's like uncooked food. i believe they will fix and will be better. but i already paid for commercial product not a girl friend's cookie. when i buy a car, there is no doubt its perfectly functional. cyberpunk 2077 is..like good looking car, but no signal light and audio. it's working and you can drive it, but don't want it. i believe they will fix it. but as i said, i paid for product and it's defective one. and it won't be changed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"i finished cyberpunk 2077, what a ride. not since deus ex human revolution has a pc game's story pulled me in and want to explore all the different endings. my personal favorite is panam's for sheer satisfaction and narrative payoff. that's not to say johnny's wasn't a complete emotional gut punch that had me tearing up. i did all the character missions. all of them were deeply interesting. i never knew what i was getting into and the game always surprised me. for that reason, when you reach the endings, everything you've done until then feels earned. v wasn't a likeable character at first for me, neither was johnny. it was over the course of many missions and interactions that i ended up liking both characters. a lot. practically every character is deeply human, with flaws, dreams and hopes. your friends and allies are well written, but of course the cake goes to v and johnny. there is also excellent directing at times. in shallow games, the spectacle is flashy and empty, here's it's used in the context of the narrative perfectly. again, it feels earned. there were quite a few moments where i was like holy crap, we're really going to do this?. also there were moments of sheer beauty and emotion that rival death stranding's ending beach sequence. for these reasons, this game's emotional payoff ranks among my favorite story based games of all time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,i'm playing it on a ps5 and as it is buggy and crashes i am 50 hours into it and still really enjoying the game. the bugs don't really effect game play. combat works perfectly and mainly that is all i care about i can move around the map complete quests with little to no problems. i would say well worth it to play on next generation consoles and will just get better with updates
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"the good thing about this game is it is visually stunning and has a really good story line. now on to the negative sides even if i exclude the bugs and glitches there are lots of issues that you might have already noticed. as an open world game it felt like it had very little to offer other than the main story lines and tons of side quests. some sides quests are really fun tho tbh what i meant is as an open world game for example when we play games like gta as a whole franchise, not just any specific gta game there are tons of fun stuff to do other than doing quests, as an open world rpg fan i have spent tons of times exploring skyrim and oblivion even after finishing the main quest line. even not so successful first watch dogs game has many good things as an open world game. there are fun arcade mini games, random events, poker games stuff like that. even cdpr's witcher 3 had gwent, which was really fun, i have spent hours roaming all over the witcher 3 map to find new npcs to challenge and collect new cards like many other players. but for cyberpunk i didn't find anything that than can  me into the vast open world that they have created, not too many place of interest in this game. specific pubs and stuff only available for players and there is nothing to do even if you go there, so no point going there other than questing. npc ai is nonexistent, even oblivion ai looks far better to me compared to the npcs' of night city. at least they would start random conversation among them which was and still is great meme materials. if you attack them some might run but others will attack you back. even old games like gta san andreas npcs' react in some way when you hit their car or themselves, or when you try to rob their car for your quick ride. to me it felt like they put these npcs to just fill the void of night city. crafting didn't feel like that alluring to me either. i remember i spent hours collecting all the diagram of armors and weapons in witcher 3. the whole process was fun and rewarding at the same time. but here i did not feel the need at all and finished the whole game with what ever the drop i got from enemies or missions. cyber upgrades are also not that charming either, there are some good upgrades and help you become strong but i started upgrading them pretty late in the game and didn't feel it was mandatory in early game while you can feel how important augmentation in deus ex game. and more than that is there anything unique or new this game offers? this game looked like a blend of many games to me. games like  remember me, gta, watch dogs, deus ex, fallout etc. but i didn't find anything so that i can say, oh this is cyberpunky when i play other games like i said when i saw those cyber upgrades oh this is deus exy or when i saw brainstorming i said oh this is so remember me ish other than bugs and glitches i don't think these problems will go away. bugs can be fixed and cdpr looked determined to fix them with several hot fixes, which is good. so i will take it as a story telling games, once the story is done the game is done kind of game. won't count this as a long term playing rpg like skyrim or anything or just for having fun doing stuff on open world kind of game like just cause. this game could have been the best game of decade, it really had the potential but with these many flaws it is just another game, play, enjoy till the main story ends, uninstall. only reason i gave it 6 ratings is because of the story. i enjoyed it. the character build up is also good. at least that much is expected from cdpr and they did not ruin it on this part. i do not care about console, so no reason to give it 0 for console gamers' sake. open world 210 story 910 music 910 graphics 710 would've given more if not for those glitches and rendering issues gameplay 410 overall 610"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"absolutely good game, beautiful story. have problems like ai, bad cyber psycho quest and kill blue marks at map. have very good secondary quests, similar main story quality, but hard to find it because blue marks and cyber psycho quest"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"this vote for now is a placeholder it can be downed, but for what i have seen 3h game on my machine i7 2x 1070 geforge, 32 gigs of ram and a normal 2tb hd at ultra default when i started the game detail work just fine, no frame loss, no bugs, it run very smooth the only bug that i have encoutered its the transition from the game to the desktop i play on 1080 borderless windows that dont work fine edit 1 now i am on my 150 hour of playing this game and i have just found some minor bugs tpose, ragdolls problem the game continue to work fine on ultra, this game is huge, and it have a lot of beautiful corner that just need to be discovered. i have just one cons, the three route are just the same, i think originally was meant to have each one a different path 1  the road route was meant to be played as evil with the possibility to be part of a criminal bands and wear for example the horrible maelstrom facial implant and play the criminal hunted by ncpd 2  the nomads route was born to be the less evil of the three and maybe the canon 3 the corporate route meant to be the most evil of the three by working for corporations, and bring the corporarions to victory by any means but i think that this feature will appear in the online game, so in the end is a very good game, even if it need some refinements edit 2 31122020now i can give a final vote for this game, cyberpunk 2077 is full of untapped potential, too many closed doors, too few collateral activities to be an open world, yes you can clean up the map of all things including assault in progress  also useful for discovering secret areas but once, as you proceed in the plot, other secondary missions are added, but they can be counted on your fingertips, after which the world is completely empty and devoid of everything. undoubtedly the primary quest and many of the secondary ones are beautiful and fun, the search for secrets also takes a lot of time and is fun. unfortunately as many say the ai is really poor especially that of the npcd, cops appearing out of nowhere etc. yes the police, it needs to be refined a lot. why then 8? because the main story and the secondary quests are very well written, the characters well defined and well dubbed in italian. but the bottom always remains this world so large, so empty and not very interactive. google translate"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"cyberpunk 2077 is most definitely a milestone for the design of detailed and realistic openworlds. the storytelling is on a very high level, as usual from cdpr. the best part of the game are the main characters and how you can interact with them. of course, there is still room for improvement in terms of the roleplaying aspect. the roleplaying aspect is the point that disappointed me the most about the game. the game feels to me like it was only designed for the nomad lifepath with the best possible ending in mind because aside from a few other dialogue options and the first 20 minutes of the game, the choice doesn't make a difference. i would have liked cyberpunk to be a bit more like gta 5 in terms of features and personalization. yes, it shouldn't be a gta set in 2077, but character personalization through hairdressers, tattoo artists, etc. would have been very nice. without such possibilities, it is not a full rpg for me and i think it would have been better if each lifepath had a specific character not just one v for all lifepaths. in summary, cyberpunk 2077 is a great story game that would have benefited from more rpg elements. i will remember it with a smile and look forward to what stories cdpr has to tell in the future. because don't forget bugs and glitches are annoying but avoidable and don't change the experience that cyberpunk is meant to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"a month ago i started playing red dead 2 and i said it's the perfect time because i can compare with cyberpunk. however, i have been playing cyberpunk since december 10 and i was extremely disappointed, for example in cyberpunk there is no animation to drink anything. i was in the game and i clicked on 10 bottles of alcohol and nothing happened, i come out of the inventory and see that i am drunk. the only positive aspect of the game is the story, the city full of lights and spectacular buildings character and weapon customization. otherwise, bugs everywhere, cars that teleport and items that do not render. the driving system is incredibly weak, below that of watch dogs, and the cars i noticed can't be tuned. the shooting system is mediocre, in general it's a weak game. it doesn't deserve the title of 2020. cybeprunk doesn't bring innovations, gta 5 a game from 2013 has better animations than this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,i had a really good time with this game and i'm reviewing this after some time of the game release to give it what it deserve cyberpunk is a masterpiece in my opinion but i really wanted the game to be longer to live with the characters even longer because it featured a great and likable characters but the game isn't complete yet and it looks like cdpr released it to give people a chance to play it before the actual competed game in the next few months.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"cdpr should have launched this game in early access first. this would have saved them a lot of welldeserved headaches. i will admit that there is a good game underneath all the crap, but it's so hard to find it sometimes, especially when you are constantly reminded by development artifacts about all the missing features, broken and unbalanced mechanics, untapped potential, and the legion of bugs, that i feel i'm just beta testing the game. lastly, even if the game was not in this rough of a state, i would have still given it a 7 or 8 basically penalizing 2 or 3 points because of the lies they sold us prelaunch, coupled with the fact that they knew what they were doing, but chose to not be forthright and forced reviewers although they are partly to blame as well, especially the 1010 ones...come on!! seriously?  to not show their own footage and also withhold any info regarding the console versions. with that said, i do need to mention, that i have an unhealthy lovehate relationship with the game... i find myself playing it every day  i'm now at 150h. and i hate myself and the game for it.  i'm not sure what keeps bringing me back to it, but i surmise it's a combination of  too much longing for a cyberpunk rpg  too much waiting for the game to come out  selfpunishment tendencies  it's charactersstory  some things that i've yet to become conscious of yet. i wish i never bought it in this state and i wish i would have only been made aware of it 6 months or 1 year from now...just like i did with witcher 3"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"i was actually going to give this game an 8,not because of the bugs and the optimization,because of what could have this game been. quests have the potential of being hardcore rpg or a great action open  they are the mix of two and it decreases the fun you have while playing the game,nevertheless the characters are amazingmain character included,also the atmosphere,mission designs,buildings,side missions and to me combat are amazing,its nonsense comparing this game with gta games because even the game isn't an hardcore rpg story wise,it is gameplay wise. the only problem with this game that it acts like both action open world and rpg , that makes the game look bad but the emotions you feel in this game are unexplainable.1010"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"where the game truly shines is in 10 aspects. the storyline, the atmosphere, the immersion, the dialogue, the cast, the characters, the sound design, the graphics, and most importantly the quests. and.. keanu reeves, not like i need any explanation. a professional. character he played is awesome. the character progression feels in place. i felt very comfortable with the game menus right away mainly due to heavy similarities of witcher 3. the same journal order, the bone implants to carry more weight like the bag for roach, the skill tree has a wide variety of perks to upgrade to and cyber implants menu heavily reminded me the mutagen menu in witcher 3. the ability to store your weapons in a trunk and houses which you unlock after certain questlines is pretty much the same like the storing chests system in witcher 3. the kiroshi's eye implant which gives you the ability to scan key objects also reminded me of geralt's witcher's sense. apart from the menus, the fast travel locations are like the board signs in witcher. instead of calling roach, you call your self driving car which gets to your location it really fits the atmosphere especially due to the fact that it somewhat exists right now. the variety of approaching the enemy territory based on your play style. you can go full on gun blazing via the main door if you decide to spend your attribute points on things like body and reflexes. if you upgraded your intelligence and technical ability you could hack the backdoor to open instead. you can go stealth. it is best when the cool value is high. the game is trying to do a lot of things at once and it does that at least in a satisfying manner. the shooting feels good with a great impact from the weapons and the gun sounds, badass reloading animations. the driving is good enough with great engine sounds. i won't get into too much detail on these fields except that cars have a wide variety of vehicles from budget cars to supercars, desert bikes to sports bikes. the differences of guns which not only have standard once but also tech weapons like electromagnetic guns that can be charged before shooting for higher damage and smartaim kinds. the stealth is good, sneaking behind the enemy, hiding bodies, disabling cameras, throwing special grenades that scan enemy area, launching optic damage scripts to blind the enemy's eyes implant, using a silencer, turning off projector's light bulbs on approach so they won't see you in dark and sending scripts to objects like radios to distract enemies. a lethal and nonlethal approach. it's all there. the quickhacks in combat are useful too. sending daemons to a running person towards you to temporarily disable his implants so he freezes in place and screams in pain felt badass. or turning enemy's turrets into friendly allies was hilarious. the enemy netrunners could also try to hack you and fry your implants. different enemy types like humans, robots or something in between as it's cyberpunk drones. they all have their own resistance and vulnerabilities. like vulnerabilities to thermal damage like explosives, chemical like poisoned bullets or electrical damage. you yourself could attach special modifications to your clothes to be more resistant towards particular enemy fire. the original score is an absolute blast. when it's playing action tunes in the gunfights in the background or the car chases. with combination of all the high quality excellent sound effects that the game has. it doesn't just make you feel more badass, but it also plays suspense when needed  especially in braindance sequences and the right tune in the more emotional moments of the game. songs of calmness and anarchy on the right situation. just a couple of my personal favorites are the rebel path and corposeduction tracks. like a samurai once said  we never fade away. the final quest and the ending... it was truly epic. all the aspects are important but the most important for me are amazing quests and a great diverse gameplay with a great deal of variety. no  microtransactions and game activations, pure single player experience, ingame goodies, original ost included, the dialogue, the storyline, the small details you find in game, the easter eggs, the hacking, the stealth, the music, the sex scenes, the gunplay and driving, the voice cast and mocap, unique gangs, cars, art and fashion. a satisfying ending. it is the true aaa cyberpunk game. and cdpr remains to be my favorite developer. the quests which featured psychological and philosophical themes and even personally touched me in certain aspects. ' patience pays ' this is the game i will definitely remember for a long time. it is undoubtedly the step to right direction for the cyberpunk genre and i can't wait to see if we'll have more dlcs and maybe even expansions for it. i hope that it will turn into a franchise and will only get better from here."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,game is overrated. even when those guys removing all bugs and other issues i can't really notice nothing very big in these game. a lot of things quite similar to gta 5 or rdr 2. good graphics but same you can get in many modes at other game like skyrim or gta. not very interesting story about crime and other bad organisation. classic choices and a lot of gun fight. few cars and motorcycles with almost same driving simulation. only 7 point in my opinion as long as they not repair everything and add some better things.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"this has little to no effort put into ai. the game has an abundant amount of glitches and bugs. it cant hold steady frame rate and all that doesnt even scratch the surface. it had so much put into details like these we really dont need instead of proper ai, bug fixes, frame rate theres really no excuse as to why the frames are so bad because every other game seems to run fine, gta 5 works fine on a ps3 and more. the game should not have released in the state it is, the scummy move of only allowing gameplay cdpr give to be shown plus no base console information at all. you just cant defend this game or cdpr, i will admit the story and voice acting was great, but the cons are higher to climb then the pros. you can love this game but honestly you dont have to and cant defend it. ive played both the ps4 version and pc version. they have such a dramatic difference between how well each platform runs. you still struggle to hold a steady 60 fps on a ps5. a few patches wont fix this game, it needs a full reset. theres too much content missing for it to just be fixed. it honestly feels more like a few dlcs then a game. the amount of content that should be in the game isnt, its not even that much of an rpg, its a pretty bad rpg. comparing this to other games in the same genre doesnt quite make sense. you think that just because the others had bugs it makes this game justifiable. while those games had bugs, they also had content that cyberpunk doesnt seem to have. this game is one of the biggest gaming disappointments of all time. i just have to put this out but keanu reeves performance was abismal he sounded like he was recording his lines like it was a coffee break. his performance was a huge disappointment, the voice acting of the other characters was actually really good. the npcs that walk around or just sit there and the police have the worst voice acting and ai. i think the dora game on wii had better ai. this game honestly shouldnt have released it had great potential but just has too much missing. its like they wrote down everything they were gonna put in the game and just rubbed out most of them at random. p.s if the frames are bad now just wait til multiplayer releases. great potential horrible execution."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"i will start by saying that i waited for a long time to not only play cyberpunk 2077, but a cyberpunkinfluenced game set in a near dystopian darkfuture. this one takes the cake overshadowing every other entry in the genre. the story takes every great elements from books like neuromancer, movie references from blade runner and many others, modern themes as well, and meshes everything together into a masterful dark themed world. you will fall in love with a lot of characters and create bonds in a city were words like relationship and friendship are absent. the game was facing a harsh launch due to a premature launch especially on lastgen consoles but right now the cyberpunk 2077 is more than playable. sure there are some missing features but the games gives you subtle hints that those are gonna be added in future freedlc exactly like those in the witcher iii. it's pointless to say that the game is visually gorgeous with and without raytracing. it gives you plenty of screenshot possibilities with a photo mode like no other video game. if you're curious you can check what i've uploaded on steam cloud or on my instagram called nightcitydaily. after finishing the game twice and tried every ending i started developing a hobby for exploring every corner of the city in search for weird, beauty and extravagance. night city is a masterpiece of world design. a wellcrafted openworld map that hides small details in every corner of the streets. there are some minor visual bugs and glitches but nothing game breaking like i found in other rpg's, nothing unfixable. my final point is that no matter your style or preferences, cyberpunk 2077 will provide a great gameplay experience, amazing visuals, great storyline and characters, outstanding voice acting, and spinechilling setting. you'll understand once you pay some attention at the world and compare it to real life. you can call it a caricature of what we live right now. give it a try and don't get consumed by hatred and media who earn money from blame and chaos like a parasite. not even me or my review. please think for yourself and be your own judge! see you on the streets of night city!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,this is a great exciting game where one prologue lasts about 6 hours. ive always wanted a first person game with amazing story and cyberpunk delivered just that. it could still use a lot more improvements though.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"this game is masterpiece. main story, characters, second quests is so interesting. its one of the best games im ever seen. a lot of problems with technical aspect, but i think temporarily. i expected more from character leveling and implants. game world is big but npc a bit stupid physic of cars and v is bad but all these disadvantages are covered by a wonderful plot and the work of the scriptwriters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"the absolute worst endings i've ever encountered in any video game, ever. hopelessly miserably and nihilistic, trash endings force the player into nonsensical damnation and suffering. are these choices related to the choices the player makes? no. is there any way to avoid them? no. well perhaps don't play the game. this is aside from all the other issues qol issues, crashes, bugs, superficiality in terms of world design, not much to do interaction wise besides major game loops. i think it is quite arrogant of a publisher to punish a player for finishing the game. what's worse is i felt compelled to finish the  ending because of my time investment. this is not an rpg, it's an exercise in sadism, to disperse the artistic vision of game designers who do not respect your time or the medium. i imagine done, once again, in the name of subverting expectations. in other words, laziness. there was a chance for a great game to be made here. i suppose it is ironic that a game concerning, critiquing, and satirizing a technological dystopia becomes everything that it espouses to criticize. tldr don't waste time, endings are garbage, lots of bugscrashes, game loop is fine but in a narrative driven rpg thats not really the point is it???!??!?!?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-31,"a very solid rpg which got way too little polish and was obviously rushed. storytelling, voiceacting and sidemissions are topleague. the first person view even takes witcher 3 out in terms of immersion. maybe too few choices in the main story except for the last 3 hours or so but this game excels with it's side missions and extra storylines basically four parallel 'main'stories in addition to the actual mainstory and gives you many liberties to chose which path you'll tread. the only negatives i see would be kinda boring gameplay. you absolutely have the choice to do everything stealthhacking or without killing anybody or just shooting everything up. but in the end it never really matters and it's fairly easy. also from a technical standpoint it is at this time far from finished and needs a lot of work still. play it a few months after release and you'll hopefully find an exceptional game. just don't watch any trailers of set expectations"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"great story in my opinion. there is some depth to the characters i never saw in a game before. i saw some one bug in my about 80 hours of game time. a goon was stuck in wall after killing him. as long as i'm getting great entertainment i think i can live with a bug or two, without having to post in every available thread about my problems. rated it a 10 before, but it started to get boring earlier than expected. nevertheless quite a good game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,i love the game. there is obviously some glitches i have it on stadia but play on my pc. i think it's an awesome game though overall. i think once it's fixed up some it's definitely one of the best games of the year. everytime i turn it on i end up playing for hours.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"while it's not a perfect game, it's the one that has hit me the most. the characters, the stories, the soundtrack, the animations, the city, ... every aspect of the game felt like a lot of work and care have been put into it. if you love storydriven action rpgs or immersive sims like deus ex, you won't be disappointed by this incredible game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"its a boring, soulless game with nothing to do between missions. never has such a large world felt so empty and lifeless. the perk tree seems detached from the final game, many of them are worthless. it is clear that a lot was cut from the game. console performance and bugs are distracting from the bigger problem  the game just isnt very good."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,i personally think that this game doesn't deserve all those negatives reviews. must be hard optimizing such a detailed game on 7 years old consoles. i'm now at approximately 40 hours into the game and the only bugs i've seen are funny and didn't prevent me from progressing into this awesome game. would highly recommend this game !
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"despite the large number of bugs, the game surprises me a lot with the story and the endings."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"be reasonable yea they have  management! for sure! he lied to all of us about the game being ready but its a really great game the only thing that wiped me is the performance of the game! its really bad yea its a lovely and gorgeous game but why there are not options in the graphic settings that could help peoples! to get the best fps possible! the game is not optimize they are working on it like witcher3... but this one... this game needs more time to be stable and optimize the game is not for those who have low or about a med pc if u have a good or high end pc it will be a great game for you! but again i want you, guyz, please.... if you dont want to get hurt....................... lower your expectations!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"cdproject did it again. amazing game, great storyline and characters, unparalelled immersion and atmosphere, mindblowing city. enjoying every second after 94 hours. of course the grapical glitches could have been avoided, but i have experienced no gameplay error, neither game breaking issue. of course i could imagine working traffic police, all buildings and shops open, higher responsiveness of environment. but the most important things are there  great gameplay and astounding immersion. cops spawning out of nowhere do not break my enjoying every single minute in the game. looking forward dlcs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"currently at 80 hours played, 1st full playthrough was 45 hours, but i was skipping a lot of side content planning on my 2nd playthrough being the 'real' one this game has its issues, but at least for me the bugs and glitches haven't been more than annoying, and they've gotten better with the patches cdpr have put out. my worst problem was that i was getting a lot of crashing, but after troubleshooting that turned out to be either because of my gpu or the overclock i had on the gpu. i ended up replacing the card and borrowing it to a friend, i haven't had a crash in 30 hours, he was crashing as we were setting the card up in his system until i removed the oc and left it stock despite the issues the game has, i am having a ton of fun with it. the gameplay is fun, i love how relatively real the characters in the game feel especially how they randomly call and text you, i like the lootcraftupgrade systems in the game, i enjoy the monkeying with the fashion of my character despite the game mostly being in 3rd person, great customization as far as character builds, the story isn't amazing but it is engaging and a lot of the sidequests and gigs are really good, the game looks gorgeous playing on an rx 6800 with mostly maxed settings, a few things that don't make a visual impact but do make a performance impact turned down, the world feels dense and alive... i just really enjoy this game, despite the flaws, and if the glitches and bugs are ironed out i would give it a 910. some things that i would improve on... i like the 1st person view in a lot of the cars, but many have so much crap sticking out of the hood it's hard to see. vehicleclothesgear customization. being able to change v's appearance in game, even if just by a haircut. improve traffic ai. probably some others i'm not thinking of now, i don't think any game is a perfect 1010, despite how often review sites throw that score around, glossing over issues with games or even dropping scores for things that has nothing to do with the game itself like politics, racism issues or gender equalityfreedom. update currently at 117 hours in, finding tons of stuff i missed in previous playthroughs, being impressed with the detail the game has and how certain choices can make you completely miss things in the game or cause some events to never happen. i still haven't been really affected too much by bugs and glitches beyond some minor annoyance. definitely a solid 810 game that for me is now creeping towards a 910 even with the bugs and glitches just because of everything i've found in more playing time that i'd missed or not noticed before."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"clearly an incomplete game that was rushed out, and the hype didn't help it's case. the story was meh and gameplay is monotonous and repetitive. it feels like any skills you choose have little to no effect on how you play. choice don't really matter and there is not much to do in the world. yes i've had some major bugs on pc but nothing i wasnt prepared for. i will say the city looks very good its just such a letdown when you come to realize its just an empty shell. the biggest point to take away is that the game is just plain old boring. everything it tries to do has been done better by games 5 years old. the most disappointed i've ever been in a game but again that is partly because i had such high hopes. there are so many better games out there to devote your time to. it may have been decent had it come out 10 years ago but not in 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"more like a 910, but its current 710 rating needs to be balanced out. im loving the game on pc using an rtx 2060 super. i havent experienced too many bugs, and the game is playable on ultra settings on my rig between 30 and 60 frames per second albeit with a controller  mouse  keyboard feel odd, especially when driving. using a controller, i think the driving is nearly as good as gta v, and the shooting mechanics are on par with destiny which is unheard of for rpgs. stealth is functional, but its a crying shame that cdpr removed wallrunninghanging from the game. night city is the most vertically dense open world ever created  its visually unrivaled as well. ai isnt great. the story, however, is really solid im about 50 through the main, but ive played 50 hours due to side missions. cdpr promised a far more innovative game, and we should have been more skeptical. innovation can still be found, but the most exciting promised mechanics, e.g., unique life paths, customization, unique cybernetics, and vertical movement mechanics wallhangingrunningclimbing. in spite of everything, i still consider it to be a solid 910. its just that the game we were supposed to get sounded like an 1110, and for whatever reason, they dumbed it down considerably. if you have a decent pc, try it out. or wait a few months cdpr will surely smooth out the bugs and add features."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"first of all i am extremely disappointed, the game doesn't introduce us to even smidgeon of what it was supposed to. it doesn't have extensive character creation allowing you to personalize your v, theres no bodytypes. there's no consequential choice to be made in the game during your conversations, and even in what you do. i have played it over 80 hours, loaded and saved many times to test this out and whatever you say does lead to the same track of the story. the ai is atrocious civilians in the city act like zombies they either all cower, or runaway when you use weapon, police just spawns on top of you. forget police chasing you or anything like that they are too stupid to climb after you on the ladder if you run from them to the roof... so in that aspect i'm extremely disappointed... there's no replay value in it to me... because i'm not going to waste time through everything i have already seen... even when johnny silverhand appears during the quest trying to push you to take one way over another, none of those choices change anything in the game. no one attacks you because of how you finished your quests, no one becomes your friend giving you some advantages... nothing... but in general in it's linear main story, it's a decent game, it has a decent characters and decent story... i'm not going to talk about the bugs... so in general is below average for me... it will entertain you for a little... to me a huge disappointment, considering how much of a cdpr fanboy i was... ps... i dont think its fixable by patches, unless they rewrite the whole game..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,cyberpunk game of the year 2020. amazing experience in cybperunk world that is rich in content and missions. technologically game is most advanced game i have ever saw. all negative reviews are from people playing on 5 year old hardware that struggle to run game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"dips into 15 fps on recommended hardware. buggy mess. bullet sponge enemies, very weird driving, rigid and unpolished movement. the atmosphere and graphics are great and i applaud the artists worked on the visuals. music, voice acting and animations are not bad either, but the massive dips in performance just made the game unplayable for me. the illusion of choice bs is very much present in this game and i had enough of it while playing walking dead series, so i had no tolerance for it in cyberpunk. even if the game ran at 60 fps, and there were times that it did, the gunplay feels very stiff and unpolished. i mean i'll admit, my expectations were pretty high since i've played 100 hours in cod mw for example, and this is an fps rpg, but like, even borderlands 2 has better gunplay. it's obvious that the dev team did their best with the resources and time they had, but it was just not enough and management pushed the game out the door before christmas to please investors. i'm pretty sure in mid 2021 this game will run far better with far less bugs, but the core gameplay is stale. the story is good but the world is empty. these deeper issues might never be fixed so, be careful before buying it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"to address the elephant in the room the game is a buggy and glitchy mess. sometimes you cannot run, cars are falling from the sky, you die from nothing, npcs are scared for life once you shoot next to them etc. aside from that, the core gameplay mechanics are driving, shooting and character progression  and none of those mechanics are well executed. 1. the driving is terrible. cars are slow 200kmh max with luxury sports cars and clunky. sometimes they get stuck on a  and fall through the ground, other times they crash through boulders and trucks without losing speed. none of them have proper brakes other than the handbrake and require a deceleration prior to fully stopping. and lets not even mention driving on a motorcycle oh boy... i personally don't understand why there are only cars running on gas why not electric in a cyber world, yet there are no gas stations in the city. 2. the gunplay in cyberpunk is decent but the guns are pretty repetitive. all that counts is dps and there is no real distinction in what weapon to use against what target. enemies are bullet sponges and don't really have any weaknesses you can abuse. if a character is high level, it does not matter that he is naked  it will still take you mass headshots to bring him down. the melee combat is clunky and pointless. you mostly just smash left click to kill an enemy. 3. character stats are mostly just x something. you don't learn any new skills or capabilities, you just make what you already have better. that makes grinding through repetitive side quests tedious and not fun. the story is the strong point of the game, but it is mostly carried by good actors, rather than a good script. except for the main actor for the lead role of v, the voice actors did a really good job. v himself has a lot of voice lines which sound out of place, as if they were recorded without context. if they were going for an immersive experience in an imaginary setting, i would have preferred gameplay as in stalker, where the character progression is less rpg based, but more realistic. the character progression is not fun anyway, as it doesn't contribute anything to the good parts of the game. meanwhile a lot of concepts like dumb bulletsponge ai, who cannot see you unless you are 1m in front of them, are just ruining the experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"the physics look like a game from 2000... gta5 is from 2013 and there is no comparison in terms of quality, playability, everything. cyberpunk is the worst game in recent years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,this game was being made by a bunch of goofs listening to dumb tweets about boobs and dinks from the start... know who made this game good? grimes. this is the best 80 dollars i have ever spent on a digital album. grimes is so good that i give it a 7.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"excellent game! just finished first corpo walkthrough  took me nearly 40 hours to finish main storyline  and definitely going to do it again. i play using geforce now so everything seems to be running just fine even on ultra settings. cant really understand whats going on with this negative review bombing  personally i find this game to be a really good rpg with action elements and definitely met my expectations. those who are giving the game scores lower than 8 must have forgotten that it is a game  not life  whats even more funny here is the fact that some of the 0 rated reviews are positive about the game  there are some minor glitches here and there but its impossible to build such complex, dense world without any of such. i played it from the release date so also went through all the patches up to date  as i said  did not experience any game breaking bugs and many minor ones were already polished. also seen it played on ps4 and given that it is 7 year old console and no one should expect same quality as seen on high end pcs  game was playable and friend who showed me the gameplay enjoys it  plans on getting ps5 tho to experience the game with better graphics. pro tip for console players would be  get an ssd  cant wait to see how cyberpunk 2077 evolves and how this great story could be expanded by dlcs! higly recommend the game  dont judge it before you at least finish the main story line!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,a great game with a wonderful story. this adventure took me many hours and allowed me to plunge into this incredible world of night city. many thanks to the developers for those emotions and experiences for the main characters. emotions and empathy for the characters are what i love about your games. thanks!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"don't cater to the reddit hivemindset. it's a great game and it deserves praise for the things it does right despite some of it's glaring flaws. well let's start with a few basic questions. is this game a good rpg? no, even witcher 3 wasn't a good rpg. go play any obsidian's the outer worlds if you are looking for something in a similar vein. there are many problems, where do i even start. there are 3 major endings with some minor variations in how you approach them to create around 6 paths for the endings, but everything leading upto them are determined only by some of the major side quest chains. there's no permutations of different minor choices or anything of the like affecting the narrative in any shape or form except some instances. even factions like arasaka, the gangs, other corporations could have made for excellent faction quests changing the story but nope, they aren't here. cyberware also feels underutilized, and offers only some variations to gameplay. is this a good actionadventure game? not exactly, comparing npc interactions, physics and various other aspects of this game if compared to a rockstar game falls short. i don't want to drag on this review since i am pretty lazy and don't want to write much, but if you are expecting a great narrative, characters, soundtrack, open world design, they are all here. it's a great game but surrounded by controversy and stupid decisions from the upper management at cdpr false marketing. 810, could increase this score later depends on the expansions"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"i wonder if most of the bad reviews have even finished the game, or just complaining to get on the bandwagon. its an excellent game, not without a few bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking or to make it unplayable. and i have a pretty old machine. but what game doesn't have bugs when it first comes out? i have to admit i'm a little disappointed in certain things they changed from the 2018 demo they showed, such as the cutscenes. i get that it was all first person to try make it more immersive, but i really think it only hurt the game somewhat by removing them. because of this and the first person only it sometimes plays a bit like a borderlands or fallout game. most of the fallout games really aren't that good because they have a very poor to non existant story. however this game has an excellent story, even down to some of the random side quests. i'm really not sure how i feel about the story and the endings, but i think that's what makes it so good. i've now played 150 hours of what i can honestly say was an excellent game, and cd projekt red delivered exactly what they promised."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"damn you cdpr for  us over this holiday season. this is basically the unfinished 2015 prebeta version of cyberpunk 2077. i want the version we were shown in the 201819 gameplay demos. some much is missing, it's a travesty. i started a list below but gave up, because it's worthless. the game ain't done. it's a regression from 2 year old demos we were shown. how does this happen combined with lengthy delays? the good.  night city looks gorgeous, the buildings, the highways, some of the markets.  cinematics are done well, facial expressions look great.  i actually like this shoehorned keanu reeves character. johnny silverhand has some great lines and helps ground this always firstperson rpg experience.  hacking is cool as technomagic in combat. with the variety of attacks and environmental and enemy manipulations available, i think having this build saved my playthrough. the bad  combat ai is nonexistent. an old obtuse title such as 2009's killzone 2 displays infinitely smarter enemy ai with support, cover, flanking, etc. cyberpunk enemies operate on rails, they'll move back and forth in and out of combat or otherwise rush you in straight line. it's easy to bottleneck them in crowds and take them out one by one. the only challenge is the amount of damage you take vs the amount of headshots these bullet sponge enemies will take.  npc ai is nonexistent. night city is populated by automatons. any npc talk prompts result in a one liner dismissal of conversation, not looking for new friends or what do you want?.  driving. straight line speed appears to be heavily governed, the vehicles have no weight to them, it's like driving rovers on the moon.  npc driving is limited to single rail loops around the city, no ai for them or for police.  police, any attempt to copy gta failed. police can't drive, they spawn behind you. escape a warrant by running or driving 100 meters or so to the next neighborhood.  combat is wonky, shooting is ok. enemies are so spongy. it takes away from any satisfaction you might get from, says, a point blank shotgun blast. instead of satisfying physic, you'll get a flurry of damage numbers and perhaps a weird glitched out body explosion. there is cover taking, dodging, and sliding, but none of it works as well as what you've seen in ip like wolfenstein, rage, killzone, etc. notice i mention games not popular with the fps community. that's how bland this system is.  crafting is useless, loot drops scale faster with enemy levels than you can keep up with crafting and upgrading."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"i liked the game a lot and had no bugs.story was awsome and tought provoking. anyhow after many hours i finished all the side quests and the main story, now i'm back after the ending exploring every section the city bit by bit. looking for hidden gear and mini quests i might have overlooked."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"fantastic storytelling in a beautiful world containing some elements that can and should be improved. it is all about the story in this game, which is extremely captivating! the game runs great on pc and, for me at least, with very few bugs. but please do not expect a new gta. with a few updates, the game could be phenomenal in the future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,this game is not the game that cd projekt red promised. it's not an rpg and it's barley an open world because it's missing so many details that make an open world game what it is. even without the numerous bugs that can potentially ruin your pcs memory the content hardly compares to a 15 year old game such as grand theft auto san andreas. you fanboys are part of the problem which makes companies get away with such greed

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"a huge hype and over expectation is the source of bad reviews and complaining. everyone wanted something a bit different and you cannot please all the expectations of all players. hard rpg fan would complain on choices and not too long playing time and console gamer is overwhelmed by stats and character development. if you focus only on the main story yes maybe it is 30h but why to rush if other quests are fun and the world is so rich and beautiful? normal players that want to enjoy the game and familiarize with the environment and ui will spend much much more time having fun. i have to admit that most of the very bad reviews comes from ppl that probably didn't give the chance to go through the prolog 68h. pros amazing story, gorgeous graphics, gorgeous music, great huge open world, huge fun, cyberpunk climate, great starting point for continuations... cons for now and nothing that cannot be fixed soon some glitches  bugs, ai of police and pedestrians, content removed from the current version train, car modifications, transmogging, more interactions with npc and world fooddrinks, video games etc, use of braindance has huge potential that can be used in the future in detectivecriminal story."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,"it's by far the best open world rpg since witcher 3. great storytelling, fluid, fun and engaging combat. this game suffers though from the aggressive marketing done by cdpr. people were really expecting this to have all the best mechanics done by all the open world and rpg games so far and be better than all of those games at it, which is impossible and unrealistic. i think the lesson cdpr will learn from this mess they made is to put their marketing team on a leash."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-30,i'll start by admitting that i preordered the game and like it. i've played it for almost 130 hours now. the problem now is that it feels like the game is rushed. the story feels a bit empty....mostly it feels like they changed the story after keanu reeves was introduced for johnny silver silverhand. many mechanics are missing. i cannot customize my character. i cannot buy new apartment. heck even life path does not in any way effect the main story at all. a total dissappointment

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"don't let the bad reviews lead you astray. this is a great game. the first few hours with the game, it felt like an 810 to me. it seemed disjointed, the game systems were deep and i found myself getting lost in them, and i had trouble figuring out what to do to move the plot forward. i also couldn't tell how much time i really had the plot hook made it seem like i had no choice but to barrel through and play to completion as fast as possible. kinda felt like assassin's creed from a few years ago but in a different setting. once i realized that wasn't true, and i could just play through each neighborhood to my heart's content, the world opened up. the missions are enjoyable. there are many different ways to play through each mission that reward different playstyles. there's banter you can listen to, and some of it is really well scripted. there are lots of side conversations to be had. whole side quest trees that can merge into the main story and reshape it. it earned a 910 once i saw how well scripted the ending was. you'll find yourself wanting to get lost in night city, driving from mission to mission not because you have to there is fast travel, but because you want to experience the thrill of electronic music in a cyberpunk cityscape, roaring at a 100mph on your cycle. you'll take zen lessons from a zen master. you'll choose to eat the yakitori in a conversation with an npc, because it feels right. you'll look forward to the rain and how the city reshapes around you. you'll learn the city's districts. there's a lot i wish they could improve still. it's buggy and lacking polish right now, so 1 to my score. the first week i encountered several game immersion ruining bugs. since then, they're more occasional. not great  flickering here and there. overall, there's a level of sloppiness that just becomes apparent. especially in the dump and trash ridden areas of the game, items don't lie correctly or float weirdly in the air. this is just sloppy. from an immersion perspective, i'd like to be able get rewarded for experiencing the different eats of the city. there are a lot of people walking around and it would be good for them to seem to have more purpose or direction. i'd like to feel even more immersed in the city than i do. all in all, i wished they'd pushed the game another month to clean up pc. but if you decide to buy it now, it works well enough. i played the game on a gtx970 and gtx1070ti. worked fine, though you have to tune the settings. it's easily worth the 60 i sunk into it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"for me its the best game of the decade. the graphics are the best actually in a pc game, with raytracing on is awesome, the history is great. yeah its a little buggy but i had no major bugs or glitches. and has a lot of content, actually i played more than 100 hours and i'm not finished all yet, of course i'm playing it like an rpg, so i go slow, and i do a lot of side quests, and that's a really good point in the game, with the ride quests, you could fall in love, found great loot, and get really good histories, like the peralez the mayor of night city, is awesome how a side quest, have the same quality of a main quest. the game is buggy, yes, but with 1.06 version most of the game broken bugs are fixed, and the others could be solved easily. and if you buy the game on gog is only 38.56, so that game for that price is awesome, it could get you more time for play than any other single player game, is like a gta, in the future, with awesome graphics, a lot better history and great graphics. highly recommended."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"unfinished. too many bugs. need to do all side jobs before main story?... bad optimized. looks like they only focused on the story, thats why they get 1 star. pull it back and release it in 3 or 4 years. it looks like it need much more time..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"despite the horrific marketing scam and the comical broken mess they released my primary gripe with this game is the story and gameplay not the bugs or crashes. i though it was cliched trash with lackluster characters a weak rising action and climax was so bad i couldn't stop laughing. the falling action was also terrible, these things along with the weak voice acting and weak character profiles just makes this whole game worthless to me. psn removed it and so did xbox that tells you where it is at, as far as the studio who developed this trasher piece they should feel ashamed of it. 30 hours of my life spent on cdpr hoping for another witcher3 instead i got scammed. at least i got my money back. all in all i can't recommend this to anyone take your money and more importantly your time elsewhere. earth is a big planet with lots to do but night city is just another dump."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"everything has already been said. theres something wrong with this game. it is fantastic, but incomplete. at the moment it should not even be for sale."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"the game itself plays fairly well on my gtx 1080ti on my 2560x1080 monitor max settings. the story itself is quite good. tons of side quests and stuff to do. my main criticisms with the game are 1. vehicles are almost undrivable with mouse and keyboard especially motorcycles. the vehicle handling was tuned with analog input in mind. using the keyboard will have you tapping keys quickly to do micro adjustments. anything else will send you spinning out of control. 2. a lot of content was cut from this game. just to name a few things wall running, crowds, one night stands. there is a massive reddit thread with a more comprehensive list. 3. your origin choice effects the first 20 min of the game and some dialogue choices. very disappointing. honestly, if they fixed the horrible vehicle handling with keyboards id bring my review up to an 8. hopefully they add back a lot of the cut content in dlcspatches. that would bump my review up to an 8.59.5 but for now, what we have is a 7.0 nothing fantastic, but its not nearly as bad as everyone is saying at least not on pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,excelente experiencia !!! disfrut mucho la trama y el desarrollo de los personajes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"the mains story is very good but sometimes it feels rushed, it feels like the witcher 3's main story is way much longer, not gonna lie the game looks spectacular but you can't sacrifice phsysics for graphics, in order to achieve a good inmmersive game both graphical and physical aspects need to be equally treated and on this game physics are nonexistent which is very sad, even games from 10 years ago have better ai come on. i was watching the 2018 game trailers and i realized how a lot of content was cut like 3rd person cutscenes, weapons, both character and car customization, house upgrades, animations and plenty of more stuff, anyway i wouldn't recommend the game at its current state, i really hope cdpr manages to polish the game enough to be a worthy game experience"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"cd projekt finally bit off more than they could chew. as a studio they have a long standing reputation for charging headlong into problems, verging on the brink of bankruptcy, throwing crunch and cando attitude at it. and it has worked for them in the past witcher 2, witcher 3 and thronebreaker are highly regarded games. as are the witcher 3 expansions. even witcher 1, despite its many bugs, shortcomings and clunky control issues at the time, is mostly remembered fondly these days. but the day finally came when icarus flew too close to the sun, when throwing crunch and manhours at a problem wasn't enough. with cyberpunk 2077 the studio forged into a completely new territory for them completely new visual style, new weapon mechanics, driving mechanics, hacking mechanics, completely different lore and universe etc. the smart thing do to would have been to make a smaller, tighter storydriven game in the cyberpunk universe. something to dip their toes while figuring out shooting and driving mechanics and how really big modern cities work. but no, that apparently isn't the cd projekt way. their new game was to be the biggest and boldest interpretation of a modern future city ever conceived, intended to make rockstar look like wannabe upstarts. but sadly it didn't work, whatever the failings of cyberpunk 2077 are they aren't to be blamed on the developers but on the outright hubris exhibited by upper management. you can't make such a big studio turn on a dime and have them develop a type of game they've never developed before. or maybe you can but it's an extremely highrisk play and in this case here the end product has suffered enormously, the reputation of cdpr has been forever tarnished and i'm sure there are hundreds of developers who wonder if it was really worth their time. cd projekt needs a serious management overhaul, as a studio they've grown massively over the years but they've seriously underestimated the longterm planning and steadfast vision required to run such a studio. they managed to make witcher 3 because it was a universe, setting and collection of tools they were familiar with. but when the time came to go in a new direction they grossly underestimated the difficulty of doing so, this is not a sign of good management or leadership. i would recommend to cd projekt that their next game be a witcher universe game with a smaller scope and tighter plot than witcher 3, and make it perfect and bug free. something to get back on their fans good side again, and patch witcher 3 with better graphics and a few bug fixes and tweaks for free. then in 67 years time revisit cyberpunk again, and this time make the game you actually wanted to make because clearly you didn't manage it this time. the new cyberpunk 2 team should start now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"what the  happened here? on one end, you have a pretty good open worldrpg hybrid, on the other is a broken, buggy, and uneven mess. i dont think this game is awful at all, as it shines with potential greatness. however in its current state its a buggy and underdeveloped mess that should have been delayed at least 2 more times. it doesnt matter if you have keanu reeves, or a great story, great romances and arcs with closure to each, when your economy and ai are all over the place. it doesnt matter if you have good hacking abilities when you cant even equip them all or find ways to utilize them because your enemies are reused, tposing sandbags. it doesnt matter if the gunplay is good when the guns are unbalanced and unfinished. this game isnt finished, and thats putting it lightly. seriously, people forget that cd pulled this  with witcher 3 and now rush to defend that game. again, i dont think this game is terrible, as a majority of its systems still work and ive had a good to great time with it. however, this isnt ing finished at all. from both a technical and systematic standpoint this game is an absolute disaster, but as an open world narrative adventure its absolutely beautiful. due its problems and potential, cyberpunk 2077 lands at a solid 50100. until further notice, this game may be enjoyable but is ing unplayable. dont even think about buying this on a console either, youre going to burn your house down. this is my personal opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"i was waiting for this rpg for one player game. it was optimized for my old !laptop! with gpu gtx 1070. i get my 3540 fps with resolution 1440 p, high graphic settings. i'm suppose that i'm old school player and offline rpg in new world is perfect for me. f you have pc just try it. t is the best game which i have lay in this year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,story is  i have played a couple open world games which are bots 400 hours and red dead redemption 2 300 hours and are way better than cyberpunk. i have about 40 hours on it and have completed this  game just because i didnt want to waste my 50 spent on it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"termine el juego con un final. me di 70 horas de juego aproximadamente disfrutando cada detalle y haciendo solo las misiones principales y secundarias, aparte de algn que otro encargo. estimo que en total llevara 100 horas completarlo en un ritmo tranquilo. el juego me encant en lo que es historia y ambientacin. los modos de juegos quizs no son lo ms innovadores pero si son divertidos. la ciudad y los detalles grficos as como el guin son espectaculares. lamentablemente el juego se siente que no esta acabado del todo, por eso se pueden topar con algunos bugs. pero confo que eso se arreglar con el tiempo. el juego no est para que le pongan un 0, porque tiene mucho trabajo puesto ah. pero tampoco un 10. el juego tiene mucho potencial, y seguramente con el tiempo, correcciones y parches vayan mejorando y corrigiendo dando un producto espectacular. pero hasta el momento segn mi veredicto, el juego le doy un 810."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"edit lowering my score from a 9 to a 6. oh my god the story and cutscenes are so effing boring. and they are soooooo long. it's like being forced to watch a boring movie. cd projekt.. just give us the damn gameplay that's why we play games, leave the cutscenes to movies. the good  cyberpunk atmosphere is almost perfect.. the sights and sounds and people are twisted and futuristic  gunplay is satisfying but held back a bit by low framerates and some input lag  fair amount of deusex style freedom in how you face challenges  voice acting is stellar  very immersive  the bugs aren't nearly as bad as the antihype makes out, but yeah sometimes you fall through the floor to your death the bad  there is much depth in the story and little depth in the gameplay. for me, i want the reverse of that situation. there are too many boring cutscenes and dialogue lines. i want 90 gameplay 10 story not 5050. this is why i deducted 1 point  combat is a little too easy. even on very hard, i'm not having any trouble taking out big groups. i'm using an assault rifle build and just headshot everyone. while it's really satisfying, it's also repetitive and easy. overall i already have my money's worth at 20 hours and i reckon cdprojekt did an awesome job with this game. i'd be raging if i had a ps4 but on pc it's fine and probably less buggy than many other open world releases in the past."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"one word to describe cyberpunk 2077 is disappointment. the game is really fun and enjoyable at time but there's way to many drawback for me to finish playing the game at its current state. there's obviously a lot of missing content in the base game, dialogs options are usually limited to two options which also doesn't really matter as the choice you make won't impact the ending, night city is amazing to look at and the visual is phenomenal but once you look pass through the facade you will be greeted with an almost empty open world. the game is also fill with bugs and if you're lucky enough to play the game without encountering any bugs or crashes you wouldn't get a decent fps without sacrificing your graphic setting for better performance. if anyone is wondering the spec of my pc it's rtx 2060, 16gb ram, intel core i7. i know that my pc isn't the best but to not even be able to run at a stable 45 fps on medium setting tell you about the state of the game optimization."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,one of the best games ever made and ever i have ever played. generally comparable with gta but more sophisticated combat system of typical rpg
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"one of the best games ever made thus far. sure it has some problems at launch time, but i found nothing game breaking, and all the good outweighs the bad. in particular what is great about it is some of the story lines and the atmosphere. really got me immersed at points and felt some sort of emotional attachment to the characters like i never had in other games. sure to be critical it felt like probably cdprs got overwhelmed at times. after all a game of this scope is a major undertaking. like when rockstar came out with gta3 it was a big shift. maybe some people going by by the percent of negative reviews expected gta5 like perfection, and just overlooked the good of the game. anyhow after many hours i finished all the side quests and the main story, now i'm back after the ending exploring every section the city bit by bit. looking for hidden gear and mini quests i might have overlooked. and can't wait till they add the multiplayer component they are looking to push out in 2022 or so. it's the end of 2020 as i write this. you can just wait a month or two till they will probably have fixed a lot of the things people complain about, or just enjoy the ride now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"the story is solid and the main emphasis is aesthetics and world building. the combat and leveling is competent. i wish there was a lot more variety in the body types and modifications available. i hope that's in development. there's a few freaky looking people around, but considering the possibilities, it's pretty tame. i've seen one insane guy with no jaw, but that was as crazy as it got... mostly just regular people with weird jackets. it doesn't seem like that hard of a thing to build in, so hopefully there will be more variety later. like, why not people with horns and doc oc appendages and  the in game media is fairly wild, but that overthetop attitude doesn't translate into the actual people you deal with, so it rings false sometimes. the ambience is excellent. that feels completely correct. the music is great. weirdly, the best jazz station of any videogame i've played. anywho, excellent experience so far, about 40 hours in."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"i disagree with the review bombing, no game is worth 010 and certainly not cyberpunk 2077. on pc the game is absolulety gorgeous and nearly flawless except some minor visual bugs. people would have been mad after cdpr if the game was not setting new standards for graphics. i believe most of the negative reviews come from ps4 players, well i guess they won't cry about the poor optimization of tes 6, because it won't even be released on their console haha"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"bug ok. but !!! this is the most insane world all video game. i can't stop play like an old game named the witcher 3. exploration, loot, story telling and more... when the game will be patch it will be a great game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,cyberpunk is a gem that hasn't been fully cut and polished. still a gem. thank you cdpr !
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"the game isn't finished and is lacking many basic features like a solid ai, physics, believable npc behaviour. the city is looking good, even though there isn't enough going on for the real megasprawl feeling. character models aren't good, and the animations are terrible and gameplay isn't fun. the rpg system is lacking a lot, and the choices are just illusionism, not shaping the story, not a good game. even as a fan of the cyberpunk genre, the ttrpg source and open world rpgs, i advice to avoid this one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"amazing game with breathtaking story! cd project make realy cool game, but with a pice of bugs. i play at ps4 pro, and have a lot of fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"let me start off by saying that cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece of storytelling. the story, fairly, starts off pretty slow. other than that, the characters, the plot are amazing. night city is the best city i have ever seen in a video game, shoulder to shoulder with los santos. the music is absolutely fantastic in the game and i simply was driving around and listening to the radio. the driving, for a studio that has never done it before, is awesome! oh  the bugs. hardly ten minutes pass without a bug. the enemy ai is dumb as hell, the physics are non existent and there are a lot of bugs like your motorcycle being stuck in the street. there are some game breaking bugs, but not so often, and it crashed like 7 or 8 times in 6 hours and it can't even be constant 60 fps, on a good pc. this game should have been delayed to march 2021 or something. in overall, the game is fantastic when it works. but right now, it does not. the execs of cdpr should be punished in forcing the devs to release the game in this year. i am 100 sure that cdpr will fix the game in 2021. but, it will impact further cdpr sales, because right now, this game is far from acceptable on pc. i heard it is even worse on consoles. so, if you are reading this, do not buy the game yet. buy it in february once it is fixed, and if you have it, get a refund."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"it's insane!!! incredible gameplay, super detailed graphics, perfect sound, i can't describe how much i love this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,special graphics and good story but ai and physics to be improved. thanks for this game cd projekt red.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"it's an amazing game, the story is one of the best in the last years, the graphics are incredible and the music is great. the stealth system is a little bit weird and there are some minor bugs like the voice from the phone sometimes not appearing you can still read subtitles 24122020 v 1.0.5. i usually dislike 1st person games but i loved this one. it's a futuristic witcher 3 it really feels like witcher 3 1st person. it's fun and immersive, it's emotive sometimes and it gives you a ton of hours of gameplay and many many more if you want to make all the sidequests. sincerely the best game i've played in years. don't let people tell you it's not worth it because it is. not perfect but close with some patches, it's not very far away. maybe in other systems ps4 xbox one it's flawed i don't know but it's a great experience on pc, i didn't have any problems like crashes or corrupted files or anything like that. anyways you have to play it, it's a must play. this is my honest and sincere opinion about the game, it's not driven by emotional biases, i'm not a bot or a clone and everything comes fom my own gameplay and tbh i thought it was going to be a trainwreck reading all the opinions. i was gladly mistaken. 910"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"it's not gta  get over it. but the game is on pc fun and one of the best story of pc games i've ever played. some technical issues and some weaknesses  bad ai, it is horrible to drive cars  motorcycles are totally fine  lead that i only give 9 instead of 10 points."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"i enjoyed the game, but it shouldn't have been released like this, especially for ps4 and xbox one. pc version was better. the story was not that long, but the secondary quest gigs were made it three times longer. the musics were awesome."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"love it. despite some minor bugs and glitches. graphics are amazing but the the strongest point is the storyline. playing on rtx 3070. there are some areas for improvement, eg. npc and physics. but still i give it a 1010  i just love this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"with all its many flaws, to which there are many, there is a stunning dystopian world worth exploring every inch of. sure, the ai are often buggy, there are many aesthetic glitches that gnaw at one's suspension of disbelief, but underneath the vail of problems is an engrossing and inexorably fun world that is ludicrously addictive, gritty and enrapturing. this isn't the gamechanging hypemachine that many were lead to believe in the trailers, but much like the witcher 3, cdpr's previous instalment, the draw is not impressive ai and revolutionary combat, but a deeply compelling story with some fantastic voice acting and at times jawdropping sights that are begging to be fully realised with better driving, npc's and a broadening of impact that the player can have on the world. i am, as i was upon the witcher 3's launch, as hopeful as ever that we can see these changes in the coming year, that the huge, complex nextgeneration experience that was pitched at launch is delivered to the fans of cdpr."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"despite the fact that the game wasn't completely ready for launch as well as the issues on last gen consoles, it is still a very good game. it's not perfect, no, but it does allow for excitement for the game to reach its full potential with the upcoming patches and dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"great game! i have 60 hours in it and still want more. great story, characters, gameplay. yup there's a lot of technical issues but nothing that cant be fixed. really don't understand peoples spamming 010, this is sick. it must be frustration and disappointment about ps4 version, cdpr made huge impact on storyteling and deep quest structure, once again. i hope this whole bad stuff with console version will have a god end after all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"this game is trash. it under delivered on every aspect cdpr marketed it for. not talking about bugs, which i'm sure will be fixed, the real issue is that this game is just a big empty shell, in which you'll play a completely linear story and a few side missions. you have no choices, no impact on how the plot evolves, nor the option to just wander around and immerse in the world because of how flat the environment is. nono minigamesno activities, no ai for npcs. i really hope this whole fiasco will seal cdpr's coffin. we really don't need another bethesda, ea or bioware type of greedy stupid corp polluting the gaming world."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"why is the hacking minigame the exact same thing the entirety of the way through regardless of objective, location or level when it literally encompasses the entirety of what is hacking in cyberpunk 2077 play style  i'd have thought that hacking, seeing as it is a known class in the tabletop, would've gotten more love  why so little love for one of the paragon classes of the og game? and when you can get the perks, your reward is to play less of the minigame, like they know its kinda boring  especially 90 hours later? why do you need legendary mats to upgrade legendary items... when the rarity of these mats mean you won't be able to craft the upgrade and the very next common item out performs your legendary? why attack higher level mobs when their drops are always for a higher level character, ergo no reward for your risk? why buy any car after you have jackie's bike? why does no one in night city have trauma care response other than the women in the first quest? we do kill people other than gangbangers. why craft when what you can routinely find the very next level outperforms what you crafted? why do iconic items share a look with noniconic items, aren't they iconic? why is there a mirror you can vaguely mug at? at first i thought it was to see more and more johnny in your mannerisms, but its so bethesda fugly its seemingly pointless? why can't you lock or save weapons you want to keep when the game routinely asks you to pick up 20 weapons per encounter and either disassemble them or sell them all to the nearest vendor? what is actually happening in the world when your character is disassembling, please explain in a non immersion breaking way? why does the rain look so bad? why so few enemy types? why does every vendor buy 20 guns no questions asked? why are bosses immune to hacks when it invalidates a netrunner build, or if not immune just so damn expensive and ineffectual? why does noone else in the city or the bad lands ride a motorcycle? why are there so few brain dances? why can you buy brain dance disks, they're not labelled as junk, but you can never play them with the headset you are especially given? why is the first brain dance the best one with multiple layers and heartbeats and urgency while the rest are a snorefest? why is the ui so terrible for making a phone call or checking a phone message? why is the layout of the skills not organised in a way to suggest a build type? why is explosive damage in crafting? why are grenades so terrible? why isn't the order of the phone messages preserved in the chronological order they were sent when you reply? why is there no traffic ai for a city with traffic? why is there no crowd ai for a city with crowds? why is there no police ai for a city with police? why are there no indicators on clothing, like there are on weapons, to tell you what is better or worse as compared to what you are currently wearing? why do certain items have weight but not others? why do you have 164 healing syringes in no time? why is there a street cred system, wasn't it supposed to show your street cred to various factions by the clothing you could wear... it seems like its just another xp bar that gates equippable content? why does noone remark on your elite street gear other than clothing vendors who do so no matter what? why are there no faction standings which are influenced by your actions? why does the fixer of a region immediately know you've stepped into their neighbourhood and immediately start offering you cars and gigs even when you've done exactly nothing to prove yourself to anyone? why are you offered car after car after car after car in seemingly endless carousel see what i did there between game hours 38 when each of them are ridiculously expensive for where you are in the world and if you could buy one, you could buy only one? why is the purchasing of that parked car so sterile? why are the ui map elements for cars, gigs and side jobs all the same exclamation icon? why be able to choose your genitals? why are enemies so bullet spongey when they are wearing a tank top and i'm shooting them in the face with a double barrel shotgun? why don't i ever see myself go under the knife when i got to the ripper doc to feel the loss of humanity as more and more cyberware is added? why can't i try clothing on to see what it looks like before purchasing? why can''t i respec my attributes? why can't i change my hairstyle? why can't i see the tattoo johnny gets me in a good close up? why are there foam cut outs in my stash? why do i have a computer in my apartment with the net, just for that one mission? why are the perks clumped to even attribute levels so there are many blank levels with no perk choice? why have nomad, corpo and street kid backgrounds other than to flavour the first 2030 minutes... and to provide text prompts which don't really seem to add too much benefit, but thereafter to offer no discernible benefit to replayability? i can go on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"true, it was released to soon, but nothing game breaking and most of the bugs will be fixed. however, it offers the best open world experience and attention to detail is obvious in every aspect of the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-29,"people bashing this game are ignorant. the witcher 3 and especially the goty edition with all the dlc is a culmination of 8 years and 3 different iterations of the game by cd projekt red. to expect the very first iteration of cyberpunk 2077 to be as polished as that is insanity. first of all, the sheer amount of nuance in the world with character models and animation, technology and tv ads, city scape and the like, simply dwarfs the complexity in what needed to be handcrafted and unified, compared to the simplistic rolling hills and mountains and puddles of a fantasy setting game most of which can rely on heavily procedural generation with variables and handediting afterwards, which is not so easy in a futuristic game. cp2077 on pc is a fantastic first step in what is sure to be an amazing game. it's physics lacks compared to gta iv, but again rock star had how many iterations of the game before they got to 4? how many decades? just what it is that cdpr was able to get out is sufficient and fun for those with good enough hardware to run it. to those without, serves you right for trusting in consoles. pc master race forever."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"if this game is launched exclusively on pc and next gen console, i think it would receive far less criticism than it deserved. played it on pc, and i dont even have a killer one, gtx1080, it runs smoothly with some occasional bugs here and there which are expected. the storyline slowly grows on you and i cant wait to play my second playthrough"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"linear story with barely any player choice. huge shiny world that feels hollow due to lack in world activities outside shooting things. typical complaints everyone knows at this point. calling this an rpg is stretching the term, you can choose your combat style and that's about it. no character customization past intro. you can choose your junk but not body type. armor choices are dictated by stats so you end up looking like a deranged hobo. customize living space, nope. customize the vehicles you grind for? nope. you can role play as shotgun v, pistol v, etc... but not corpo v, nomad v, or street kid v. shoot a gang leader in the face in one of the missions? don't worry his gang won't remember and be friendly. over hyped, under developed and uninspired."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"i really enjoyed this game. after playing it, it becomes really clear, that the strengths of this game lie within it's story and characters. cyberpunk 2077 looks absolutely breathtaking at its best, when there are no random people spawning in front of you or cars dropping out of the sky. the gameplay is nothing really special or revolutionary, it more so inherits many elements that are considered to be good mechanics. the combat is pretty standard, but can feel really satisfying at moments, although the stupidity of the ai is mostly beyond ubisoft level. there are stealth mechanics, which give the game a nice touch, but the hacking part really feels like they ripped it straight out of watch dogs 2. the open world feels very alive and makes a really great background for the story and side quests, although there's not really that much to do here. the game is an rpg, but its mechanics often feel more like a loot shooter. you go there, complete the mission or just loot some bad guys stuff, equip it and then repeat that until your equipment consists of legendary items only. over time you'll gain enough points to upgrade your skill tree, which has so many different options that don't really seem to affect she gameplay that much. the only major problem i, and likely many others, had with this game, are the amount of bugs and the amount of missing optimization. if i'm lucky, the game runs on 40fps in most areas of the game on midrtx settings on a 2080, textures take a lot of time to load in and it generally feels really unpolished. if you're a fan of good stories and characters, and don't mind the game feeling a bit unfinished at times, i would really suggest you to play this game. it may not be genre defining ornrevolutionary, but it's definitely my game of the year 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"i was looking for great story i got one of the craziest rpgs i have ever played and i played plenty of them starting from things as old as baldurs gate or fallout 1. the choices you have and the net of consequences of your choices is really cool but requires more thought on the side of the player and repetetive plays or either looking at other endings after you finish. game tried to convey different problems, its not pondsmith's cyberpunk 2020 pen and paper game but some more modern variation of it original storytelling of pondsmith is based on events he saw in the 80s so a lot have changed. im dissatisfied that i couldn't get more out of it but for me it was solid 4050h of really great experience. i will not comment aiglithes d they are there but its a question what you look for brilliant rpg and innovative story? buy cp2020. gta in the future? download mods for gta v."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"played the game for 70 hours. there are some bugs but most big openworld games have that and it will be fixed. but it's still one of the best singleplayer games i have played of all times, and i have been a hardcore gamer for 35 years. i can understand that ps4 and xbox players got angry but pc gamers giving this game less than 7 out of 10 can not call themself gamers. giving a game such a low score because it's not 100  is just stupid. what cdpr and other game developers should do is to sell the game for fullprice and then be fair and launch the game as early access beta game and then polish the game over 1 year. if the state of the game was early access everybody would be giving the game 9 or 10 out of 10. if you do not have the hardware to play the game don't complain about the game, complain about your pc, get a job, and upgrade your pc or go back to playing csgo or minecraft."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"if this game is one thing, it is a missed opportunity... and a huge one at that. likely the biggest missed opportunity in gaming history! some of the decisions that have been made with this game are so ridiculously bad it boggles the mind. why would cdpr take elements from gta v crowdscarscitypolice system borderlands looter shooter rpg fallout v.a.t.s. to then butcher them all in a way that is so far beyond simple incompetence that one has wonder if this game is in all actuality nothing more than a sophisticated troll job! almost every aspect of this game except for most visuals seems like either a placeholder... or is lackluster... or horribly implemented or downright broken to the point of non functionality. and that is not even taken into account all the bugs, the obviously cut content and the misleading advertising! this game ist not even close to feature complete let alone gold! it is at best a fancy early access version of the game that has been promised to revolutionize the the open world rpg genre. not only did it not deliver on that lofty ideal... it doesn't even try! it is nothing more than mediocre looter shooter with a decent story and a hilariously bad looting system and non existing open world elements except for the stunning map. the true tragedy is that every single aspect of the game ui, gameplay and even the story and mission designe has been done before and it has been done better... far better! in some instances done far better over a decade ago! i tried everything to like this game... for 150 hours... and all it did... was... disappoint me... if you never played borderlands, gta v, mass effect 1 3, elder scrolls v or fallout new vegas you might find this game entertaining... but if you played even one of those games to its fullest let alone all of them you see cyberpunk 2077 for what it is, a disappointment and a enormous missed opportunity on every level. even when all the bugs are fixed and the game is optimized to the point that runs perfectly on all platforms, it could never be more then a 710 and that would be generous! what a waste! after this cdpr can never hope to get 8 million preorders again! we gamers may be slow to learn, but this game was just too disappointing! to all the professional reviewers out there who gave this game more than a 710... you  at your job even worse than the management of cdpr!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"it's not an rpg, and its not a choicedriven game so if that's what you looking for it's not for you. gun play is meh, the gun choice is ok but you'll just get a widow maker and stay with that the entire game. clothing while a massive selection you'll want to go with armor, fyi armor is junk it literally makes very little difference. you can add 300 armor points and very hard to tell. skill tree is interesting but i did not use half of it and beat the game without an issue on hard. two boss fights that are just bullet sponges. no strategy really just shoot lots of bullets. tech seems like a useful thing but i never use 80 of the options. stealth is there, it's ok. i enjoyed trying to sneak until it would bug out and i either got stuck in scan mode or it would just not let me grab. a billion shards that you will never read. you'll carry a million drink and food items you will almost never use. upgrading items is costly and a joke. i did enjoy the random cars appearing and trash bags exploding into the air. bugs aside there is just not a lot to this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"cyberpunk 2077 is not nearly as innovative as what was promised the unrealistic promises with this game reminds me of peter molyneux in his heyday but he made some great games even though they didn't live up to the unrealistic expectations he created. and cyberpunk is, in my opinion a great game, despite not living up to the hype. it's a solid first person action rpg with really good voice acting and animation, a good story with memorable characters and an astonishing world, nothing more, nothing less. it borrows heavily from the witcher 3 in its structure, with a somewhat branching main story and a lot of sidequests, and questionexclamation markers. it also borrows from deus ex in its mission structure, implants structure and multiple approaches to combat. the missions, general story and characterization of the main character does not reach the heights of the witcher 3, but that is a lofty goal to reach, even for the company that made the witcher 3. it doesn't do level design as good as the level design of the deus ex games either i'm missing some vents here but the visual design, the world and the gameplay really works. the gunplay is really good in my opinion, with weighty weapons even though the enemies are a bit of bullet sponges. the upgrade trees, implants and weapon modifications seem a bit overwhelming at first but works well. it does have too much loot management, even though i find it strangely addictive it's basically the same as the witcher 3 with weapons looking alike but having very different stats, and a lot of collecting and selling. cyberpunk really doesn't do anything new, but it doesn't have to as it's a really solid action rpg and night city is, in my opinion one of the most fascinating ingame worlds i have been in. i am reaching the end of the story i believe, but it has taken my a really long time as i have been busy traversing night city, doing side quests, and just taking in the sights. get the double jump implant as soon as you can, as it really transforms the city being able to escape the streets and runaround on the rooftops. comparisons to gta is in my opinion a bit wierd, as it's a much different game, even though you can drive around in an open world city. i would rather compare it to games like the deus ex games, the outer worlds and the witcher 3 even though the setting and combat is much different. i have been playing it on geforce now on a macbook pro but the geforce now service had too much wait time the first week, so i played it through bootcamp on a macbook pro 16 5500m and it actually ran quite decently and looked great. and yes there are bugs, in the beginning a lot but they have already ironed a lot of them out. all in all a great game mechanically, and an even greater story but the real king here is night city and the visual design it's such a colorfull, grim and beautiful world the cyberpunk future setting is just way better realized than deus ex mankind divided, even though i was really taken back by that games world building when it came out"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"very good game. main dialog with voice over is well thought and designed. the expression on characters face during the dialog feels natural, and character seems to give different facial response de based on the verbal response you choose in the game. not including in game sherd there are tons of side mission 5o do in the game and most side missions include interesting dialogs and is enjoyable to complete. the battle mechanics is very good and enjoyable. i like the diggity setting of the game. i would say if you only focus on the main mission and didn't spent time leveling your character, you have to be smart to deal with each battle since it is quite challenging to complete the mission just by shooting everyone. in other words, the difficult battle force you to use hacking and stealth technique to complete the mission. i'm used to ggta 5s brute force shooting everyone with heavy armor method. playing a battle in gta feels like a house chore. when playing cyberpunk, i however, i sometimes spent half hours just to sneak into the facility without being noticed after multiple failed brute force attempt. somehow this made the game more enjoyable. my pc can't cut it so i played on geforcenow. 30 hrs into the game and i only get one bug that affect the progress of the game and i have to load my saving. other than that, i didn't get noticeable bugs. i would highly recommend the game to others."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,one of the best storyline i ever played especially when you try to finish all side quests. it's like very good movie or tvshow.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"the best earlyaccess game i've ever played. it is currently a great game with the potential of being a masterpiece in the future. however, if you can, you should wait until at least the majority of the bugs are fixed and maybe a little longer for gameplay improvements and story dlcs. night city is really beautiful and atmospheric, so much so, that i almost never used the fast travel system and drove everywhere. my favorite part of the game are the main characters and their stories. the writing, voice acting, and animation is so on point, that you really can belive you are talking to a real person. the firstperson view adds to that immersion. their stories are much more touching and emotional than i expected. the whole presentation of the stories is much better than i am used to in games. some scenes are so good, that you would expect them in a tv show or a movie, which is really remarkable. depending on your playstyle these quests take bout 4060h. stealth takes much longer than melee for me personally, the story and especially the characters are so good and believable, that i can ignore most of the problems. i realize though, that that might not be the case for some people. the biggest problem with the game is that it is obviously unfinished. there are a lot of small glitches like flying cars and dissolving pedestrians. i had none that really broke the game, but they are annoying nonetheless. i like the gameplay, but i see why some people might not like it. there are plenty of playstyle options to choose, i played mostly stealth and hacking but melee and gunplay was more fun than i expected. the enemy ai is not the greatest and car ai does not exist. if npcs drive in missions they are on rails and in the open world, the cars just stop if something is in the way. the police is incapable of driving a car so they spawn right next to you and despawn if you move away. this is not gta and it does not seem like it wanted to be gta. additionally, the game is bad at hiding cut content. all games cut content at some point in the development and pointing to a twoyearold trailer and complaining that the game is not exactly like it is stupid. changing things constantly is part of the development process. but it is sometimes really obvious where additional story routes were supposed to be or where additional features were planned but ultimately cut. usually, games try to hide these open ends, i guess they did not have enough time for that with this game. i think it's sad that they apparently had to release it. it could have been the best game overall ever, but right now it's just a really great story and characters in a good game. tldr play the game! but not right now. maybe in a few months or even a year."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"pretending this game to be a flop just because there are too many kids that in 7 years didn't save some cash for at least a new gen console is just ridiculous. yeah there're plenty of bugs most of them are minor and to a certain degree this is quite normal considering how insanely deep and dynamic is this game, this also happened with tw3 but someway a lot of people seems to completely forgot this. people crying and memebombing cdpr for delaying the release multiple times, basically now they are crying for issues the entirely deserved, but this is something that is going to be fixed and give us an excuse to play the game again. night city is just freakin awesome, it literally got a living soul, the game doesn't disappoint any of its core expectations. clearly, the average gta player will be luckily be deluded because this is a gdr, not an action game thank god. asking them to explain a game like cb77 is literally like asking dominic toretto about leonardo da vinci. a masterpiece, can't wait to play it again after some patch to enjoy it even more."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"anyone giving this game a 10 is straight up lying to you. this game is a passable 6 at best. companies like cdpr give you a game like this and yet people lap it up and think a game running at 20fps on pc hardware worth thousands is actually acceptable. the game is always running on this thin line, where any time you step over it the immersion is gone. shoot someone in the middle of the desert where nobody is watching? too bad, you'll be dead in minutes as police spawn on you and one shot you. they cut so many features, but at least you get to customise your junk, right?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,the game is amazing. the negative critics is made by fortnite kids. play this game now!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"historically every cdpr game launch was very problematic. i have got what i wished for. this game is very emotional at some moments. not many games gave me goosebumps so often. the world, the characters are very believable, the atmosphere and immersion, achieved by the sound design, music and graphics.. you just have to feel it with at least rtx2060 and hifi headphones not the gaming ones. many compare it with gta, rdr. people want it to be gta, but cyberpunk is a different type of experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,the best game that i ever game! rigt has a lot o bugs but i strongly believe that cd project red will fix game as soon as possible.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,the story of the game is a masterpiece. i played it with almost no bugs to speak of and got through the story very well played on an xbox series x. the scope of the game is very good and the game is very busy on the streets.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"i honestly i would like to give this game a 10 but i can not deny technical problems of the game. these days internet is full of complains about this game. despite all the technical problems i enjoyed every minute of the game. some people critize this game so hard for 1 of its aspect , i believe it's bit unfair. there is no denying the game is broken, but it is fun and colorfull. story, characters, quests, gameplay everything is good. maybe stealth is not the best stealth expirience but it still available."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"this game is so unfinished we shouldnt even be writing reviews about it. but they released it in this state, so its their fault. i dont understand how people can rate it 89 out of 10 when the gameplay feels so terrible, the npc are a joke, the city is lifeless, the traffic also the driving , physics directly do not exist... they had a chance to really build the most immersive open world ever, but nah... lets just scam every game possible and run out with the cash the story is fine, nothing brilliant but its well made."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"this game could and should be something amazing, but failed. it's boring to play. prologue, the first and the rest of the plot are connected very poorly. it seems like core of the plot was written by professional, but then cd project fired him and hired an idiot to complete. all game mechanics are implemented poorly as well. compare to the deus ex human revolution with it's own fashion, aesthetics of the cyberpunk  as well. freaking shame for the game with 300 million  budget."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"i understand the disappointment of many players with the technical condition of the game, but giving this game a score of 0 or 1 is simply unfair and childish. despite its problems, the game is a masterpiece in many aspects  story, characters, beautiful and extensive game world. i miss a few details, those that are usually obvious in games with a large, open world  the ability to customize your cars, the ability to change your character's appearance during the game hairstyles, eye color, skin color, changing facial features  it's cyberpunk after all, it should be easy."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,game is very good maybe will not symbol for next game developers but it's good game. i have played on pc over 100 hours and no problem just few times funny bugs and that's all. cd project will fix issues and it will be great game next year.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"honest review i wasn't expecting this game. i barely watched all the trailer and e3 stuff because i hate the hype. the cyberpunk world could have been interesting, i even enjoyed the game for around 40 hours until a moment where the npc, ia, the city environnement felt like empty to me. there is always the first hours where everything seems cool, then i did a quick comparison with far cry, and then i cried.  i complete every damn mission because of the dumb ia hard difficulty.  immersive city ? npc are totally useless.  every gunfight is just about how can i shoot them in the head while ennemies are doing dumb move. so what do we have left  cinematics are good.  the ideas are cool because it is supposed to happen in a futuristiq env. but they ain't that much revolutionnary again other openworld game already did the same but in a better manner i.e gta, far cry. and finally since when do we accept an unfinished product as a final product ? when you do buy a car, or food are you like  ok the beef is not cooked yet but i promise it will be cooked soon, meanwhile please take a seat and enjoy this raw uncooked beef. when will we stop buying unfinished game ? don't you guy think that video game industry should shift their business model along with their investor ?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"have only played the game for 14 hours. yes there are minor problems, but i still think the game is excellent. you get a lot of orders and side quests or a lot of information. this is very overwhelming at the beginning."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"after 20 hours of brainless npc's, unstoppable mobile calls and dumb abd tasteless story, i have to say that this game is a big disaster. where can i start. it's so difficult because the bad aspects are everywhere. in every single part of the game!! the most annoying difficulty mode im playing in the hardest mode and it's a joke! no challenge at all. nothing! it doesnt burn guys!!  your character take every single phone call. even if your having a dialogue. i had three different person at the same time on the phone. it was a disaster!!!  cars ai, nonexistent. horrible driving feeling. i always use the travel terminal. highway with ghost cars who are disappearing.  cops, guards and gangmembers they pops directly in front of you, align in a row to be shot or are having a raveparty directly in front of the high security arasaka hq. stupid! hacks and co this had to be the most important part of the game, because its cyberpunk, so you were supposed to navigate in parallel universe  the real world and the virtual world! forget it, quickhack help sometime, but at the end you use your shotgun. its faster! this is a major failure!!!  story sometimes interesting, most of the time boring. you can zap two third of it, since they  on every situation.  city is empty. huge megabuilding. dont dream about getting in it. its impossible! clothes and style i dont believe that in 2077 every single person will be or a prostitute, a , a crackhead or a gangmember. and they all have a  ugly style! good things  some city panorama are gorgeous. but never get too close ha ha. this game was falsely promoted. i played gta5 on my ps4 pro and it looks amazing. cars are really driving, npc have a logical behaviour. cops are harsh and fun to beat! it's a challenge! cyberpunk is a challenge only because it's a mess to play!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"the game has interesting story quests. and this is the only advantage of the game. the world is empty and lifeless. the city does not look like the city of the future compare with the cities from the movies judge dredd, blade runner or ghost in the shell. the transport is boring, the controls are disgusting. if we compare the game with competitors gta5, watch dogs or sleeping dogs then cyberpunk 2077 loses to them in all respects. the city is not fun to explore. besides, optimization is simply not there. and the number of bugs is just off scale."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,the best game i played in ages it's amazing everything in it is fresh and new.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"a clear 1010 despite all the flaws. there are still some bugs, yes. but only every 2025 hours i encountered one that affected game play. there are still some rough edges and some features that feel unpolished or even unfinished, yes. but all this does not break this fantastic game. this city is so full of fantastic adventures and stories. game play is so fresh and creative and just plain fun. there are so many things to do, so many great experiences to make, so many different paths to take, so many decisions that affect the outcome of side stories or even the main story. but the amount and detail of all these side missions is what makes this game a true masterpiece. if you want, you can rush through the main story in 1520 hours. but you will miss the best parts of the game. i needed about 70 hours until i saw the credits for the first tame but still i had to come back to see more of the stories of night city and to unlock more and totally different endings to the main story. despite all the flaws, this game and this city is a true masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,what is this.... the game runs like garbage on my rtx 2080super and has more gliches than can count devs overhyped game and even when it works its gameplay is rubbish

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,look love to store my opinion and want to game just like red dead redemption that the story is so touching its not like a movie you enjoy like a movie dialogue parks are amazing especially when you build relationships in the game same thing like a movie like i said i can watch a movie for two hours straight and kind of deal this time gratitude what the character is extremely good game it has its problems of course you know eight years is a lot of years of development for a lot of bugs but can you take account with other games like lets say gta five gta five was in a seven year development and its been out for seven years and there still bugs in the game todays date no no game is especially that magnitude its gonna be perfect you know slowly yeah they can release update i just wish cd project waiting like at least five more extra months before release because right now the new consuls are impossible to get yo in at least theres a chance so people can get the consuls in five months from now and actually enjoy the game a lot of people were looking forward to the game but lotta people have the older consuls in my god its bad and in between those five months they couldve at least fix a couple bugs during the main story theres a lot of instances where the characters kind a like jump out of place but the game is amazing i hopefully when they come out with a atomized version on consol people were changed your mind but i love the game hundred percent with my top tens of my favorite games kind of gave me the same feeling during the story like red dead redemption so you know its up to peoples preference the bugs didnt really bother me much yes sometimes i had a stupid buggy got stuck somewhere it kind of annoyed me but the game was mostly focused during the story just like infinite warfare lets say like the campaign in infinite warfare was a masterpiece but a lot of people didnt give a credit i love you for expected more in the multiplayer side than the actual story theres a lot of games that they are like that like watch dogs this is my preference but but hopefully cd project does some thing because a hard seeing a game that he developed for eight years take a lot of criticism but my opinion i love the game only thing that ruins its just a bugs honestly theres nothing bad about it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-28,"game runs mediocre on high end pc, but even when it runs, the story is just mediocre and extremely boring, the endings very unsatisfying. can't understand how everything has been criticized, except the extremely bad story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"lo mejor que he jugado nunca, el mapeado ms espectacular jams visto, es puro vicio, a falta de solucionar bugs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i originally wrote a review of this game when i had somewhere around 20ish hours in the game. and at the time i gave it an 810. to try and keep things succinct. i essentially said that the game was still fun and engaging despite its flaws on launch. and that its positives outweigh its negatives. i still stand by that, but the score needs to be amended. after putting an absurd amount of time in this game. a game that i clearly enjoy. considering i've now played through every side quest and have tried to squeeze every bit of lore, story, and gameplay that this game has to offer. i gotta update my score from an 8 to a 5. the amount of bugs i experienced that would prevent me from progessing on any particular mission went from being a quirky feature to a maddening and dissapointing expectation. ui bugs, progression bugs, notplayingthegamethewaythedeveloperswantedmeto bugs in a game thats supposed to be all about choices and giving the player as much agency as possible, audio bugs, physics bugs, ai bugs, rendering bugs, lighting bugs, etc. it's just dissapointing. it's clear that a lot of work went into this game. it shows. there's detail everywhere throughout the world. it's obvious that a lot of love went into making the game and the world, characters, etc. which just makes everything else so goddamn frustrating. the dissapearing cars on the road. the dissapearing pedestrians on the sidewalks. the damn cops spawing right behind you or right in front of you. ai that runs into walls and stands still while you lob bullets into their faces also have laser hawk vision and can spot you or a downed body from across the map. or when they somehow detect a body that you've hidden when 1. they haven't found a goddamn thing and 2 what's the point of throwing in a bunch of dumpsters to hide bodies in if the ai is just going to magically find them anyway? the stealth can be fun. but it's rules are among the worst for a stealth game. it's not anywhere near as fleshed out as mgs, the arkham games, ps2 splinter cell games, dishonored, etc. it tries, but boy does it come short every single damn time. there's an incredible game hidden under the mess. i don't expect it to take all the ideas from the best rpgs of the last decade. but it certaintly borrows a whole lot of ideas. and the ones it lacks are the ones i had expected prior to launch. i'm talking stuff like a faction system. a reputation system. i mean there is a rep system in the game. but it ain't exactly fallout new vegas tier. idk. i'm just rambling here. there's a lot i want to say about this game but 5k characters isn't enough and trying to explain one point only leads me to a million other tangents related to how this game is simultaneously flaminghotgarbage while also still being one of the best games i've played in recent memory. the game it could be is at least an 8 but the game that it is currently is a 5, at best. my opinion on this game is more nuanced than the idiots that are review bombing this because the game can't run on their . again, this is a good game. but it's also flaming hot garbage.  a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad, wise words from shigeru miyamoto.... i didnt mean to say a bad game is always bad, what i meant to say is if you release a game in a bad state you will always regret it,"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i was really looking forward to this game. moreover, her advertising was crazy. i myself am a big fan of deus ex. plus, i really like the witcher. so before the release, greedily absorbed all the information on the game. as a result, almost everywhere i was disappointed. yes, there were high expectations for the game, but i'm sorry, who is to blame for this? who advertised the game so actively? in general, according to the facts. from the pros, the game has a beautiful world! yes, the atmosphere is just great! the director's work in the story missions is also well done. just watch an expensive and beautiful movie. of the minuses, the ending of the plot was unpleasantly surprised this is a subjective opinion. rpg game can not be called. almost complete absence of nonlinearity and variability. in fact, the game turned into a firstperson shooter. the open world is not alive, but what is there, it is just terrible. the game is terribly short which is very bad for an aaa scale. towards the end of the game, the plot is too chaotic. according to the result. at the moment, this is an extremely raw product. yes, most likely the game will be finished and brought to mind, but at the moment it is 6 points out of 10."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"my  have waited since 2012 for this? i have been playing this on playstation 4 pro and its horrible. there's times where the buttons like sprint and duck, just dont work at all. the open world is absolutely boring. nothing to do, sure it looks  what's the point if it's not fun? i was hopeful that it would live up to the  it didn't even come close. what a fitting way to end 2020 lol."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"get last the minor bugs, and this is one of the most beautifully written stories, and fun games to be put out in a long time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i can barely play it on minimum, got regular crashes, bugs are not that frequent as at the premiere but yeah, there are a lot of them. however, this hardly matters for me as i can't stop thinking about cyberpunk 2077 and that's what 1010 game is about for me. i was afraid that the city would really be boring and empty as some have claimed but i'm happy to announce that it's not the issue. i'm amazed by how simple side activities, which can be most uninteresting in a lot of titles, are so well executed that a player is tricked to think that every time heshe is doing something different and let's be honest  that is true for a lot of mini quests. i won't explain what fun the main story brings... normally, it would be an 89 from me because of all the technical issues and bugs, but i also intend to balance all the 0's that come from the haters and crybabies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i'ts a god sent action rpg on pc,  i'm pretty sure the game is getting better with every patches on consoles too. that's all in nutshell. for pc gamers anyway worth to look around for some cool mod contents on the nexus site, just saying. that's all for now, time to go back into nc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"the game is exceptional. story, mechanics, graphics, effects  superb. sure, there are bugs but most of it can be neglected when you look at the game overall."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i absolutely loved the story, its characters, the art and the music, it was some of the best that i experienced out of any game i played. everything else though, it ranges from okayish to plain awful. not talking about the bugs and glitches, i completely understand all the negative reviews and i was going to give it a lower score originally, but after some thoughts i don't think that this does it justice. yes the ai is horrible, the world feels kind of empty, the combat and driving is okay, nothing else stands out as amazing really, but then i thought about all other open world games i played. was any of this great in any of these games? not really. i admit that the game is in a completely unfinished state and they could have done a much better job in many aspects of the game, but that's not why people play cdpr games. they play their games because they go the extra mile just to tell an amazing story that resonates through the player's choices. on this aspect they didn't disappoint. cyberpunk isn't a mindless open world game with meaningless quests, boring story and repetitive content though they did add some of it, but it can be ignored. the story is engaging all the way, side quests are just as important and integral to the story as the main quest is and each characters have their own distinct personality and charm to fall in love with not talking about the romance options here. if you're looking for a gta 5 style of game, this game is probably not for you. but if you enjoyed the witcher games for its story, you'll thoroughly enjoy cyberpunk 2077 as long as you are able to ignore the negative stuff. the game is slow and storyheavy, not so much a game where the fun is just to mess around and shoot people. my only recommendation to new players is to focus on the main jobs and side jobs in your journal and ignore all the gigs and ncpd stuff, unless you need more money. the game doesn't do a very good job at distinguishing between the good quests from the bad filler quests and starting from act 2 will overwhelm you with so many stuff at once that you won't be able to keep up with all of them. the main jobs are just the main quest line and the side jobs are for the most part the good side quests. some of them branch off the main quest and follow the characters we meet along the road through an elaborate string of quests and stay relevant to the main story, others just have interesting stories i particularly liked the sinnerman quest line, and some are just short and funny. only a few side jobs weren't fun, the ones that come to mind are the fighting ones and cyberpsycho. some though might appear boring at first, but turn out to be really good. as a last note, i just want to say that if they'd worked one more year on the game and fixed all the broken stuff, i'm sure it would have been a strong contender for game of the year, but because the game is so broken, it distracts us from its true merit its story and the way it tells it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"while there are bugs, as much as any other bold game at launch, the game fundamentals are solid and i absolutely love cp77. the storytelling, freedom of movement... every time i discovered a new feature or element within the game i found it smooth, flushed out and the developers very much thought it through. i know there's a lot of negative views, for good reason, on cp77 but this game at its core is brilliant. knowing about all the negative views and issues, i still bought and paid full price for this game. would do it again, and again, and again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,great story. but cant even play trough the story because i cannot trigger a cutscene since 1.2. only response from cdpr is  u in a very polite way.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"the story is pretty great, but the rest of the game is your normal openworld game with thousands of markers and kinda bland. from the developers of the witcher 3 that is just a major let down. the game could easily have used another 3 years of development to make something truly special."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"after 30h i feel astonished and immersed into story and gameplay, but i see some flaws which i did't because of my first astonishment. overall this game deserves 1010 but only after patching and fixing all lacking features. now it's 810 i think."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"cyberpunk 2077 is a next gen game and i am running it on a i7 10700k with an rtx 3070. you hear a lot of negative stuff about the game. but i dint really have an issue with it. as the moment of writing this i have more than 60 hours in the game. so i do know what im talkin about. graphics wonderfull a vibrant world with lots of detal and people. the cars and the motor cycles anre very detailed and are fun to take for a spin. driving using the keyboard is not realy something you can do. use a controller for that. story amazing the main story line and the side quests. never a dull moment it takes you from action to action. and the characters are really deep and they have meaning. combat in my play through i have chosen for a snipernetrunner build. shooting sniping is really powerfull after a few levels. you will findloot so many guns. you can upgrade your own gun. the combat can be really challenging. but the choise is yours how you want to go at it. loading times it has none, well once you load up your game and you are in. some personal notes this game has depth, wonderfull environments and cd project red is working hard to make the game better. as of now im on version 1.06 and updates keep on coming. so if you love a good story, roam an open world. and depending on your system specs love a sweet eye cany of a world. then give this game a fair chance. just remember you will need a beefy pc build to enjoy all of its glory."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,a massive city to explore. tons to do. such a creative game. i really enjoy playing it. there are bugs. over time theyll get patched. i still recommend this game!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,absolutely disappointing totally broken unfinished under cooked underwhelming game. this game pisses me off. now finishing the game in 1.06 version the game is more broken then before the hot fixes. the story has a cool idea and manages to tell it in the most jumbled incoherent disorienting way. what a disappointment as the witcher 3 is my favorite game of all time. this is a piece of  let it burn
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"mostly a 10 to counter the binary people who think everything is 0 or 10. and also the console players who i suspect came around the pc version to continue bringing down the score, go do that with your own versions. the good, the bad, and the buggy. the good first. the game looks great, running it all maxed out. the game sounds great, voice actors do a good job and the music in this game helps bring the city to life. the game runs well, no performance issues. not sure how the crowds of people are for others but i have run into places with people all over the place, and some with less. the side quests i have done are well made. the mechanincs when fighting are where they should be, and so are the other systems except driving. the bad. driving is just as bad as it is in most other open world games, it works but that is about it. the main story. while it has some great moments it is far weaker then their other games, it is also way to short and has annoying moments. the lifepath does close to nothing, no bonueses, just a line here and there that you can choose to use. costumisation should be better, also you should really be able to change your hairstyle along with modifying how your body looks. not enough cloths in the game, a giant city should have more then a handful stores selling clothes. side activity that are just there for fun, in a city like this there are none? give me a break. they would help bring the city to life. the cop ai is broken, also cops have teleportation making them pop in from nowhere. no choice to play the game 3rd person. i know they went on about immersion but after 70h playing this game i can say that giving the players an option would not have changed that at all, no reason to force first person view. the buggy. this will deppend on your hardware. for me it has been without performance issues. on the other hand i have ran into some bugs, mostly annoying and none game breaking. some are bugs that cdpr should have noticed before release and delt with, like one early on where an npc that is suppose to get out of an elevator gets stuck in it. the bugs i have ran into are ones that will be fixed in the next few patches. all in all this is a good game, that will be great once they fixed all of it. would more time solved the issues? only if cdpr first gave all devs some time of work to rest before finishing it, and we all know how all to many would have reacted with harrasing the devs for not finishing the game fast enough finish game or die! ya that kind of thing... most likely the same people screaming the loudest about how there be bugs and harrasing the devs now for releasing the game in the current state."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"also on computer this game is rubbish. ignore the blinded fanatics. the gameplay is atrocious, artificial intelligence is inexistent, driving a car is a most boring task and the icing on the cake is the infinite number of bugs and glitch. not even the most powerful computer in nasa fixes the number of errors it has."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"cyberpunk 2077  um bom jogo. tima direo de arte, night city  muito bonita, principalmente  noite a trilha sonora  muito boa, tem msicas legais que realmente combinam com o mundo a ambientao tambm merece destaque,  muito bem feita a histria  interessante, ela te prende do incio ao fim os personagens que fazem parte das misses principais e secundrias so bem vivos. problemas de cyberpunk 2077 o principal problema de cyberpunk 2077 so os inmeros bugs, eles no necessariamente vo te atrapalhar na hora de batalhas por exemplo, mas o fato deles acontecerem a literalmente cada esquina  um grande problema. outra coisa que vale a pena citar,  que em certos momentos do jogo, vrias pessoas comeam a te ligar para quests secundrias, e acaba ficando super confuso, pois as ligaes acontecem uma em cima da outra.  notvel que cyberpunk no deveria ter sido lanado em 2020, ainda faltam alguns meses de desenvolvimento pro jogo ficar 100 pronto. espero que essa experincia sirva de lio tanto para outras desenvolvedoras no colocarem data antes de um jogo ficar pronto, quanto para ns no colocarmos hype exagerado em qualquer jogo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"in some ways cd projekt red has surpassed itself. the art, music, and level design is amazing. but unfortunately in many others it has taken a step back. been playing their games since witcher 1, and the general progress each title held for the company was astonishing. unfortunately with this title areas that compel me the most in games were lacking. witcher 3 and its expansions left such a wonderful aftertaste upon completion. while cyberpunk's experience felt empty. i don't care at all about the bugs many people are plagued by, what i was looking for was an rpg experience. in witcher 3 you were significantly rewarded for exploring the world. your choices mattered, and you could see a direct impact on the world from them. but here there is nothing. one of the most expensive games in history, and yet you it does not hold a candle to a game that was done with third or even less of the budget this one did. while there were some very interesting plot points brought up from a philosophical perspective, unfortunately they fell flat at the end of the day. even their first witcher had a plot more compelling and memorable compared to what i witnessed here. all in all its a true shame, and for me the writers really screwed up on this title. makes me wonder if even the same team was working on it. but kudos to the art, level design and music teams. they really excelled and for that gotta bump up the score to a 710."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"no hyperbole, this is one of the best games i have ever played. the characters and stories are intricate and deep. they live and breath and make you forget that theyre only pixels. the superb writing is done an incredible service by the animations, which are hands down the best ive ever seen. from hair, to body movement, to micro facial expressions, each character lives and breathes with their own personality and quirks. you can literally tell if a character is jumpy or lying or depressed just via the animations and how they look at you suspiciously, or scoot back in their chair, or nervously bounce their leg. none of it feels fake or uncanny valley. it feels real. the city as a whole is visually stunning, inside and out. every building and interior feels fresh and unique and perfectly tailored for the setting. each neighborhood is alive with their own culture and energy. npcs are all uniquely designed. and their little side conversations and motivations add incredible depth and color to the world. night city breathes. little details like monks having scars from removed cyberware... random mugging victims thanking you for saving them... returning to a store you drove scavengers from to see shopkeepers have moved in. all outside of missions, just there while you wander around the city. but the missions are excellent too, down to the most minor. there are no mindless fetch quests or busy workeverything is varied and detailed and has its own story to tell. and those stories explain not just that particular mission, but more about the cyberpunk world itself. this is a game that shows rather than tells, and it does it superbly. level design is among the best i've ever seen. there are so many ways to go about getting in and around buildings, from parkour to stealth to just breaking down the front door. no load screens or waiting. it's seamless. combat likewise, you can play so many different ways, and they are each effective and each feel real. they start out rough because v is rough, and they grow with you throughout the game until you feel almost unstoppable in the end. im in my second playthrough and this time i can do things in a completely different way to how i did them the first time, so much so that it feels like an entirely new game. yet both ways were powerful and both were fantastically fun. this is not a game where you will always end up a stealth archer. thats not to say there arent flaws. there are some visual glitches and clipping issues that need to be fixed. spawning likewise, though unless you make a point of looking for it its pretty easy to ignore. i had to reload a save once or twice because something prevented me from finishing a mission. the minimap is too tight so it forces you to make and miss last minute turns. i wish there were more romance options for subsequent playthroughs, because the ones that exist now are outstanding. but none of the above in any way stopped me from enjoying the game. i know there has been a huge outcry of negativity since the launch, some of it deserved. but i truly hope that people give cyberpunk a chance, and go in with an open mind and experience it for themselves for the game it is. no, it doesnt have the police ai of gta. its not meant to. in night city the police dont care, so they wouldnt bother to chase you down. its not gta. no, it doesnt have the total lifelike immersion of rdr. its not rdr. in this game immersion means becoming invested in the story and the characters' lives, and coming to care about them like you would a real person. judy and panam and takamura and even smaller characters like river and claire and misty and mitch are right up there with garrus and tali and mordin as some of the greatest characters i can remember in gaming. they don't even feel like characters, they feel like people. no, it doesnt have the vast, wideopen choice of fallout or skyrim. its not a bethesda game. those games give you endless freedom but theyre also forced to be pretty shallow because of it. this is a game that is deep rather than wide. no game can be everything to all people. gta doesnt do what fallout does and skyrim doesnt do what rdr does. gta6 and es6 are being built on mountains of experience, yet theyve been in development for longer than cyberpunk 2077 has even been imagined. but for some reason people expected this game to be able to combine all those ideas and systems that other studios have refined over decades, merge them seamlessly, in an entirely new ip and engine, release it on time, and have it be flawless and completely bug free. at some point the reality of game development has to come into play. you pick and choose what type of game you want to make and then prioritize the elements that best serve that game. that is what cdpr has done. they are known for rich, storydriven games, and in cyberpunk they have created a spectacular one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"great game, great story, 3 great endings on a 60 hour first play though. i will play it at least once more and i definitely got my moneys worth. bravo! bought 3 copies  pc rtx 2060 super pc gtx 1650 mobile, ps4 and it plays just fine on each but pushes the hardware and future patches will help. a few glitches but nothing major and even plays fine on ps4 to the point i dont understand the crazy drama because it plays fine. looks beautiful with ray tracing on the rtx with hdr and all graphics maxed but fps is an issue for melee fights at this graphics level. looks pretty good on ps4 and is equally playable. multiple great story lines and missions. i had fun. i got what i paid for. mods and dlc will take it even further. if you want a great shooter or driving game, this aint that. its a story game. good story. this game will be viewed as iconic just as the witcher 3 or skyrim was. we remember what w3  skyrim became, not what it started as and this should be viewed the same. a"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"people who givesgave more than 7, especially 10 must be some fanboys with low standards. i have a rtx 3070, ryzen 7 3700x, 16gb 3200mhz, ssd etc and the game is not stable at 2k resolution. i get a lot of fps drops down below 30. i encountered game breaking bugs such as not being able to continue a mission and i had to restart the campaign. i encountered bugs such as instant death for no reason in the middle of the fight while i was full hp or the npc didn't want to move. the last bug encoutered today was the grenade bug, so basically i couldn't throw any grenade. the ai is , even the ai from gta san andreas is more advanced... the cops literally spawn behind you and most of the time they nuke you before you have a chance to move. when you start the game no matter what path you choose soon or later you will end up doing same missions. the game was advertised as the most ambitious game, the most intense open world game. they sold us lies just like the other companies. for example back around january they said the game runs surprisingly well on consoles and the game is complete but they want to polish it a bit. in fact they worked at the console version until the release date. all the fanboys blame the community for demanding the game so early, and death threats etc.. when in fact cdpr said they didn't launch the game because of the pressure of the community. the game runs awful on last gen console and the fanboys defend the game saying that the hardware is too old and the game is for the next gen console. if that is so, why there are last gen special edition console coming with the game then? if you have time and dig the internet for every statement that cdpr did during these 8 years of development and comparing with the final product you will have a surprise, how much they could lie just like any other company..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"played on pc amd ryzen 7 2700 eightcore processor 3.20 ghz, 16 gb ram, nvidia rtx 2070, windows 10. positives my personall experience with the game is hughely positive not without some issues though. graphics are imho fantasatic, especially with rtx turned on some places look simply amazing. the scale of the city is overwhelming at least at first but gives something that we didn't have before. storywise game is again fantastic altough depressing as hell quests would work even without journal and mapmarkers as they are organicaly build into the world and give you the player sense of logic and natural consequences of working and living world. characters are great and makes you consider your choices. don't have problem with small only differences between the paths you choose at the beginning since they are clearly representations of the endings you might want to choose at the grand finale. even if we consider game much shorter than w3, it takes its time to develop characters and their storylines. obviously at the end, you wish for more  but that seem to be normal with good game. negatives as i said though, i have some issues. many thing was said about bugs... ive encountered 3 that i think are worth to remember, rest are just very minor glitches that imho are not worth to cry about since they happened maybe once every 10 hours during my gameplay. . first bug was one specific npc that was tposing only this one specific npc which baffles me. . second bug was pictured by a pair of motorcycles that swooshed from side alley into the pedestrians, killing them and causing panic on the sidewalk, just to eventually crash into a wall of nearby building although it was epic and funny as  it was a bug. . third bug forced me to reload previous save and i encountered it when ive got too far away from important conversation apparently and when ive returned quest didn't trigger next stage. . there was also fourth bug but it didn't have any consequences, though it was wierd encounter and overall funny again. when you call rogue through phone anywhere outside afterlife, ask her about personal stuff and then mention johnny silverhand  she teleports to you no matter where you are. as i said this one didn't have any consequences and by replicating bug i was able to teleport her back to afterlife p . . anyway. few other issues i have are desing problems. i use controller though i play on pc and noticed that crouch button is the same as skip button in conversations. respec item allows you to respec skill pointsperks but not the attributes which makes it useless in larger scale since attributes determine what kind of perks you can choose or maybe this was already changed?. no changing your look during a game makes no sense to me  even if we don't see our character that often it seem to be a huge oversight from my perspective. overall interactivness of the city seem to be shallow too. there is actually no activities outside of quests, not even something as simple to do as shooting range, repeatable car rides, obsctacle courses  anything that could throw more depth into actually impresive night city. for same reason npcs seem to just wander aimlessly the streets for no reason and do nothing which causes more problems the longer you think about it. night city needs more depth, and need it quickly. another thing that makes no sense to me is as it was in witcher 3 loot system... why i need to wander around whole city just to find piece of clothing i might want? instead of giving me a choice to wear whatever i might want? imho every single cloth we buy should be also upgradeable to legendary status through lower ones since as well we could build legend sort of speak of our pants, blouse, jacket or whatever like johnny silverhan did with his pants. ac odyssey did it perfectly wear what you want, upgrade what you can, make it look whatever you like system in ac odyssey is still superior. didn't played valhalla yet."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"optimization is  with mediocre graphics. this game is unfinished. a lot of bugs and they are critical. my saves are broken and main story script doesn't work. don't buy, just wait until the game is fixed developers promised in february. the game doesn't keep promises that developers given. cdpr's reputation at the bottom now. in short disappointment of the year"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i have played the pc version. it's not a bad game, but except for the story, the game fails in most places. badly done loot, good graphics but a lot of bugs infinity, apart from the fact that you need a 2 thousand euro computer to really look. very loose gunplay. the repetitive hacking system to my power, they promised us a living world, but the city is beautiful but dead at the same time. all you do is go to the marked points to always do the same, without contributing anything. it is an open world that seems more than 10 years ago than the current generation, save the retraysing on pc to give it a facelift and thank you. stealth is worthless, and what to say about ai. on the level of a ps2, which makes the gameplay fully loaded. whoever gives the game a 10 is out of sheer fanaticism. it's not a bad game, but they sold us the game of the decade, and there are like 30 better games in the last two years alone. i still remember that not long ago they said that if it comes out a month before it wins the goty ...jajajajaja"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,best game after witcher 3. need some polish but it makes so much fun and looks great. yes i got some crashes at the beginning but lategame was very smooth and the story ist incredible.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,ive just finished the game and i can say that cd projekt red are at their best! the best thing about this game is relationship with other npcs. talkingtexting to panam was like if she was my real gf despite being a married person. really loved the game and going to reconquer night city again.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"delivered product isn't similar at all to what was promised. the story, city and graphics look pretty good but all other stuff is just a joke. remember when you thought your lifepath will matter? well it doesn't, finishing every single one takes maybe 15 minutes, it only adds maybe one non significant dialog per 15 conversations. remember all of these trailers about style, fashion and stuff? guess what it doesn't matter too, your character will most of the time look like a clown, you can only wish to be dressed like some of npc's in game. if we are talking about npc's then they are complete disaster too, probably gta san andreas had better ai if it comes to npc's and police the guys who just randomly appear behind 5 metres behind you when you do some illegal stuff. you thought you will have living open world which you can interact with? there is completely nothing to do in night city besides doing main and side quests. you don't have barbers, tattoo salons, no extra activities just nothing. game seems unfinished in every aspect, you can see it even in romances. after you finish questline with any character that you can romance with there is nothing after. it justs ends after it basically starts, you dont have even any new dialogs or stuff. i feel like this game could be what it was supposed to be if it was released in next year, but now it feels just rushed and unfinished. cdpr still have opportunity to turn this into something great by adding all of missing content, but i really doubt they will bother with that."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,one of the best game of all time. it's not 10 because if your level is too low you can't use some weapon.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"worst graphics i've seen on series x, including even all xbox one games i tried in backwards compatibility and ai is weak and there are quite a few ubisoft style filler activities. but the story is great, shooting is surprising good and you generally feel that people working on this game really were fans of the  for the bugs, it all seems to be ironed out now. some minor issues here and there, but not a single game breaking bug or crush so far. you can refund it now if you so choose and it is a complete mess on both next gen and past gen technically but there really is a great game underneath if you manage to look past that"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"cyberpunk is guilty of the worst possible crimes for a game  it is repetitive and boring. after the initial excitment and novelty, you quickly get tired of the dialogues and the fights. the side quests offer no variety in kind and the main quest gets done pretty quickly and easily even at higher level of difficulty. cdpr had to decide whether to do a rpg or an action game  they ended up doing neither of them. it does not have the depth of a witcher nor the playability and excitement of dying light or gta. crafting leaves a lot to be desired so do the clothing and other customization options. all in all, a sincere disappoinment and more importantly, really not worth neither the hype nor the money."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"cyberpunk is a good game, i liked it... but it's mostly a 710 for me, and it's not even close to the classic the witcher 3 was. the pros  great story and characters. voice acting is also awesome, and the main missions can be quite immersive.  gameplay is generally fun and varied depending on how you choose to level up. stealth, melee, swords, cyberhacking... it's all there!  plenty of side missions, with generally good variety.  looks mostly beautiful if you have a good gig. the cons  it's very known now, but the game is incredibly buggy. at one instance, i had to restart a full boss fight that i had a hard time beating because the game decided it doesn't want me to make dialogue choices anymore.  technically, the game is not well polished with inconsistent frame rates and little impact to graphic settings. i was getting generally between 50 and 80fps. but the game did drop to 40 fps in some crowded areas. that is on a 2080 gtx without ray tracing mode  but on 2k.  the open world aspect of the game is quite lacking and a step backwards from games like gta. ai is very robotic, the driving is quite dull, and there's not much to do or see in the city. it's unecessarily huge, but very repetitive all over the place with mostly minimal interactions with npc or things you can do really.  the ui is a big mess, including the crafting system. consumables are mostly useless as well. the quest log doesn't have the concept of subquests, and mixes up important ones with things like buying new cars. i honestly feel the scope of the game wouldn't have been achieved even with multiple more years in development. i can see what the devs are trying to do here, but rather than building many aboveaverage mechanics, they should've focused on the actionrpg part, and focused on a smaller but more dynamic city and minimise the gtalike concepts."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,cyberpunk 2077 it's great game. a game with one of the best stories in history. thank you cdpr
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"really an incredible experience. the story, the characters, the visuals are absolutely astounding. i got grabbed in for 120hrs in my first nomad playthrough. being a fan of the deus ex series it has been great to finally play something similar in an open world. weak points are instead related to rudimentary vehicle physics, and npc ai i mean for pedestrians, not for enemies, plus some small visual bugs a few floating objects for example. these are still there because investors forced to publish the game early, for christmas, before it was actually finished. developers are already fixing those bugs and they'll be probably gone by february 2021, with the second big patch. currently end of dec2020 the game has already less bugs than any bethesda game, so if you're used to those like me, you won't even mind! otherwise just wait a couple of months, if they do these bugfixings and improvements the game is easily a 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"i feel as though that most of the problems with the game have already been stated by multiple people, however, i'll say this is without a doubt the most disappointing and shallow game i've played in a long time. underneath all the bugs and glitches, this game lacks depth. they'll patch the game inevitably, but it won't change the cut content, the myriad of missing features, the wonky ai and shallow game mechanics, the repetitive side missions, lack of actual game changing player choice, the half baked life paths, weak rpg elements, and the lack of deep customization. the game should've been released 3 to 5 years from now, it simply was not ready. my frustrations are not targeted towards the devs they were crunched to absolute disgusting levels to push out a game that wasn't nearly ready. sure, the game was announced 8 years ago, but it truly didn't start development until 2016 or 2017. the rushed nature and half baked feeling of is game is due to toxic management, extreme crunch, corporate greed, pressure from shareholders etc. i truly do wonder what this game would've been like had it been finished and was the game they advertised. unfortunately it might take a couple years to be the game we all wanted it to be, until then i shall be leaving night city until it becomes the game it was meant to be. tldr there are some great moments in this game, it has a great aesthetic, deep and engaging story, well written characters, interesting lore, killer soundtrack, and a truly well detailed world. unfortunately it is extremely unfinished, with performance issues, bugs and glitches, horrible npc ai, and too much cut content and missing featuresmechanics. the devs at cdpr truly wanted to create a groundbreaking experience, you can feel the ambition and passion at times in the game. unfortunately they weren't given enough time to flesh out their vision. i would not recommend this game in it's current state 510"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"after 95h of game play, i can say the plot is great, the music and artwork are fabulous. but as everyone know, there a a lot of bugs and glitches flying cars, taking fall damage and dying from 2 meters, tposing, glitching in walls, etc. i know that they'll be fixed in some time, but fixing all of them will take few months. game play weather doesn't change that much, ai of police is horrible, you can just run away. no customization of body after creating character no hairdresser, no tattoo artist, etc., you can't paint your guns and cars, lack of modifying the car. if someone is playing for the main plot and side missions and doesn't care of the bugs  i would recommend the game in this state."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"the score i gave mirrors the gameplay, the story and the immersion, bugs are not accounted in this score due to the believe, that they will be eradicated soon. this game is absolutly beautiful and maybe the most immersive game ive ever played, but it is alsoan example for what happens if you keep pushing on studios for an early release. this game is designed for the next generation of hardware, it is sad that this game receives so much negative feedback, because it is played on hardware it isnt designed for. but this is only one half of the truth, cdpr is maybe the most supportive studio in terms of community support free dlc, beautifuly designed storylines, etc., but in this case they may shoud have focused on the next gen first and deliver a down scaled version for low spec hardware later. it must also be said that the release shoud have been pushed to 2021, so that cdpr would have had time to fix their game before release or even do an extended beta test. this all being said, lets focus on the game itself. the game as such is an absolute masterpiece, it feels very immersive, every side quest continues in many different directions, changing the world surrounding the player. this is maybe the first game where you enjoy calling and texting other npcs, because you might get an interesting dialoge or some intel on the world and its mechanisms. every area in night city is different in its own way and i enjoy riding through the city with my sports car. the storywriting is as beatiful as in the witcher 3, maybe even better, because choices are sometimes very subtile, and you need to look and listen very carefully to what is going on arround you. overall this is one of the best games ive ever played and maybe the most immersive. the story feels great and its not compareable to most games who feel rushed on this point beside technical errors. i hope cdpr delivers fixes for the bugs soon, so the game can live up to its full potential and gets the credit it deserves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-27,"let me recap this a little bit. we wait roughly 9 years for the development process, this was supposed to be the next gen of open world rpg, yet quests, ui, and game mechanics are unpolished, cyberpunk fails to deliver the amazing experience that was promised, just search on google mantis blades broken cyberpunk 2077, you'll get a worthy example at the moment of the review. ai would perfect if the game was called cyberpunk 1995. the gamers community had to find their own workarounds for several, immersionbreaking. graphical glitches, this is totally unacceptable. the story is nice, the actors are competent, but you are on rails, basically watching a movie. the majority of the secondary missions gigs are completed just by reaching a certain place, killing everything that stands, and collecting your money. i would argue that these missions, to some extent, could be procedurally generated. the game mechanics are broken, i don't see how hotfixes alone will solve the situation. glitches and bugs may find relief, gameplay may be polished still, low quality mechanics, stupid ai and railway storyline are here to stay, they won't changed by a minor intervention on the code."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"the game looks amazing, sounds great, and has great presentation for its story, but the consistent bugs get on my nerves. this is especially when i can't even progress in main or side missions. the game just crashes. there's the odd other thing involving bugs thankfully i haven't run into texture loading, but crashing is so frequent, it's obviously unacceptable. one thing i didn't expect, that i love in games which don't have this too often, is the jumping around you can do. it's almost like parkour, minus the stunts. pretty much anywhere you can jump to is a place you can go. a double jump makes that extra fun. all in all, it's a buggy but fun game that doesn't live up to expectations. even without crashing, i'm certain most would still take a point off for it's lacking npc intelligence, bad vehicle physics, borderlandslike somewhat clunky rpg ranged battling headshot? really?, and even visual effects missing like water effects!."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"i just don't understand how many idiots gave this a 1010 ... its not a complete game, it have broken ai, missing a lot of features most of the open worlds have a lot of stuff to do in comparison to cyberpunk 2077. this game just broke my heart. don't be an idiot, don't give them your precious money. this game was the major scam of the year. not worth it, you will have to replay a lot of sequences because of the broken ai and bugs. people who are sayin there's no bugs in their copies, its all a lie or they are all blinds. don't waste your money, go play skyrim, borderlands or gta,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"the game has been in production for 8 years, in my opinion i feel like they focused 95 of this time creating the perfect story with perfect characters but only 5 on making sure the game actually runs, this game became in my opinion the best campaign in a game ever ..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"there are hilarious bugs, yes. but i haven't encountered any that would stop you from proceeding the game. but generally it's a good gamefor pc at least, from all perspectives. i was doing ultra with 1070 at under 40 fps, no wonder ps4 and xbox one couldn't handle it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"la mayor decepcin de la dcada, ni la versin de pc se salva de tener cientos de bugs que merman la experiencia de juego, siendo extremadamente optimista y por que cd projekt es el mismo estudio creador de the witcher 3, es que tengo algo de esperanza para que este juego sea arreglado, aun as este titulo no innova en nada, sus mecnicas y fsicas son mediocres, siendo incluso superadas por ttulos de hace 2 generaciones y la terrible inteligencia artificial tal vez sea la peor de los ltimos 20 aos una vergenza total. me considero fan, pero jams me caso con ninguna empresa, si lo hacen mal se reclama y punto, una vez que el juego sea arreglado mi nota podra subir a 8, de momento creo que un 6 es la nota mas parcial y objetiva que puede recibir cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"amazing story , i know that there bugs. but this will be a masterpiece soon"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"so much bug and the game doesnt give so much variant to do beside main and side quest, dispite all of that the story game ist great and its fun to play at the beginning, and the graphics its ok too"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"i find it funny that there are bots posting very short and general negative reviews saying pretty much the same things to bring down the score. check their accounts and they only have one review, which is for this game. or sometimes two reviews, one to bash this game and one great one for the game they're comparing it to. makes you wonder if these rival game corpos are doing online hits, so to speak. tl good, but could have and should have been better. worth the bugs though. long review anyways, on to the game itself this game is pretty much what you get when you combine deus ex human revolution, gta v, and the witcher 3. the world map isn't enormous, but there's a lot of elevation and density to it, and the level of detail is impressive. the attention to detail, in particular, is commendable. news tv and advertisements have entire voiced segments, and are entertaining to watch the first few times. even magazine covers on the magazine stands are readable with plausible article titles! lol instead of blurred out decorative pieces. there are a bunch of bugs that are being slowly addressed, but thus far after around 65 hours of gameplay, i've barely been affected. the game runs well enough on mostly ultra for me a couple of effects like cascading shadows and ssr turned down to high or disabled entirely and looks stunning. a lot of the more glaring bugs are graphical ones that serve to break immersion, but also are kind of funny at times. i never felt like it was a big negative though, and i expected such bugs given the complexity and scope of the game. i also expect that they'll be fixed up in time, and i fully expect to do more playthroughs. the main cast of characters keanu reeves is ofc excellent! are compelling, interesting, and wellcrafted. secondarytertiary characters are decent. i was a bit disappointed you couldn't romance judy as a male pc, but that's a minor point and totally fine haha i will agree that the open world feels... filled, but lifeless. while there are a lot of npc's with short and unique dialogue segments all over the place, for the most part there's not a lot of... life. not a lot of movement outside of the side quests. other than the people walking or driving around, of course. speaking of side quests, they are awesome in this game. some of the best quests i've done in an rpg since... witcher 3, basically. i've basically been doing side quests and there are a lot of em and barely advancing the main plot so far. anyways, there are some valid negatives being pointed out by other reviewers, however underneath all the bugs, sometimes poor optimization, and substandard ai is a beautifullycrafted and complex game. even now, to me, the game is worth playing, and i'm excited for another playthrough once everything is ironed out and improved!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"night city is the best city ever created in games so far. i'm sure the game will develop in right direction. story is good, shooting is good, stealth is fine, even driving a car is good. sounds and soundtrack are top 1110, just as graphic potential currently running with 1060 6 gb and i'm amazed even with 5years old card. gj, keep up the good work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"1. this game is very unbalanced without explosion animation my character became instant death and explosive perks is useless accidentally hit explosive tank with katana or enemy hit them or land mines with tons armour always killed my character. 2. driving the car same as driving the ship. only motorcycle is better. 3. why in the game have a bar if i can not usually drink. 4. gig mission always the same. 5.jackie welles death than he dies i can't feel anything. and i don't know tbug too.story about them is to short. 6.side missions is better then main mission and main mission is too short. 7. ai is awfull. 8. choices is illusion. 9. three live path corpo, street kid, nomad is illusion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"it would've been a 10 if it weren't for some bugs but the side missions and characters kept it from being an 8. this game has a lot of love in it. i've lost count of how many times i've said that i love this game while playing. if your someone who's played fallout, bioshock, masseffect, this is the game for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"despite all the negative reviews, this is definitely the best game ive ever played to date. yes, there are bugs, but the fact that you can look past them and still eagerly work around them says something about the game. its luring, its mesmerizing, its engaging, and it will only get better with time. the shear size and complexity of this game make it pretty much impossible to be problem free on launch without a rather extensive open beta testing program which didnt exist. i think its rather amazing what theyve accomplished behind closed doors of the studio. maybe if the developers werent being pressured to release the game on 10 year old hardware they could have focused more on making it better for the platforms it belongs on to begin with. sorry i cant speak for old consoles, but on pc this game is a marvel. i doubt any real players with decent hardware would disagree. by real players i mean not washed out reviewers who spent 20 hours on the game and gave an ignorant, clueless review. personally, ive spent over 120 hours on the game and my second play through was even more exciting than the first. im looking forward to many more exciting updates to content in the future, and hope the game finally gets the credit it deserves as one of the best games ever made."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"while i understand the game has taken a lot of criticism which has been deserved, personally i had an enjoyable experience playing cyberpunk. there were a few bugs here and there though none that were game breaking. i had one side quest that i couldn't complete however i've played many games that have issues like this upon release. cdpr has been a beacon of light in the industry and i've no doubt they will fix any and all issues with the current iteration of the game. some of the things i didn't like are the lifepaths were not at all what they claimed them to be, the skill trees while extensive are mostly stat increases as opposed to actionable skills. the main quest while amazingly written was too short. all that being said i did get lost in the game as the world space was incredibly immersive and the quests well written and i would recommend the game on pc. i do look forward to dlcexpansions. i get the game an 8.5 out of 10."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"i just finished the game, and im dissapointed. first, throught all my gameplay there was a lot of bug, glitches, ect. sometime i had to restart the game because i was stuck in a texture or else. second, despite the beauty of the principal quest, it's really short... i finished the game in 60 hours and i did a lot of secondaries and took time travelling and exploring the city. i was waiting this game for 2 years, i thought it will be polished just like the witcher 3 but the game is unfinished, there is nothing to do outside the quest  no barber, you cannot customise your cars, there is nothing to buy outside a few implants in the ripperdocs store there is no need to bought gun, you loot a better version 20 minutes after the purchase. the game will always feel empty, even after the patchs that will remove bug and improve ia, cyberpunk 2077 will still be a quick game that you can finish in 30 hours and forget about it a week after. i'm still giving a 610 because the citygraphics are beautiful, and the short story is really good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"great game! story, world, graphic. love it! i can't wait to finish it with other possibilites."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"all in all a lot of bugs has been fixed over time and i think i can say that now that ,if i start a nwe game then i won't run in any problem. at least that's the case for me but it could vary for every person. i played through the game 2 times in a row since the last update and i only encounterd only one bug that didn't affected my game experience. the problem i think most people have issues with, is the hardware they have ,because the steam page says that this and that is the minimum you should have it doesent mean that you can run the game 4k on a 1080 . that is just not cuting it. if you want a good 4k experience then you need to have a beafy pc not a cheap consol i mean cheap compared to a pc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"this game did disappoint me , but seeing the graphics and experiencing the main story and all sidequests the majority of which were great , made me realize what's wrong with it , the release date . i really feel like the base of the game is what i was expecting from cdpr , especially after the masterpiece that was witcher 3 , but in such a big world , the little things matter , they are of the bad kind , and they pile up very fast  horrible ai for pedestrians and driving cars which seem to have an onoff switch if the road isn't absolutely perfect , police just teleport behind you and they have no knowledge of how to drive after you , little graphical glitches like flickering lightsfloor textures , and some bugs panam for ex. was riding her motorcycle being behind it by 10 meters , enemies not moving , not being able to pick up items very common on robots , which all break the immersion of the plot and graphics . they can and will fix these next year hopefully , but they will be remembered and cdpr's reputation has already taken a huge hit . this could've been avoided if they would've delayed the game again , or even better , they should have put the slogan coming  when it's ready underabove the row that said delayed until further notice , and stopped hyping it up more , kinda like dying light 2 , and fix every bugglitch , improve ai at least a bit , especially police , maybe even add a physics engine  . but even with all that , i still think this game deserves at least a 9 , the combatskill tree is good , story is amazing on all fronts mainsidequests , and the music ... absolutely brilliant ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"a fascinating world map like no other. a story with potential to be one of the best, if not the best, that was poorly executed. game mechanics from all across the spectrum, mostly poorly done."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"disregard all these below 0 ratings, they're not deserved. as are the 1010 undeserved at this stage of the game, late 2020, v 1.06 tldr don't believe the hype nor the hate. get it if you like cyberpunk in general and can live with clunky fps controls for shooting. build a nondps char netrunner if you, like me, prefer the nonlethal or nonpersonal approach to conflict! first, a preamble based on my humble opinion on game ratings no game outside one bearing the ... zelda in the title or maybe super mario... deserves a 1010, let's keep it real, shall we? and metroid pick any and maybe castlevania sotn to me would be close to a solid 10, just to put this to perspective. cp2077 is atomspherically and graphically astonishing  if your pc is somewhat modern, let's say nvidia gtx 1070 upwards or amd equivalent rx57xx. the characters are all superbly laid out, as is the music wellselected and crafted to create a dense, believable sprawling moloch of a miserable night city for you to explore and maybe make your oyster. keanu is a nice bonus, i couldn't give two craps if it's him or daenerys targeryan talking to you from out of your head, it just adds a nice second layer of why you do what you do in the game with the cards that are dealt to you. storywise this is a solid 810 for me so far, with believable characters a wellpaced main story and countless ways to do your tasks, based on your build. more on that shortly. as for dialogs, this is a sour note for me. in a nutshell, they tried way too hard to make it cool. main example for every second line? missing personal pronouns. i'll never get what makes dialog futuristic or edgy when you leave out the i from ... want to tell you. it just makes it clunky and unapproachable, cdp people! aside from this minor gripe the story is delivered by great actors  the male voice of v seems to get more dislikes than female in the almighty internet, but i think both are fine. the game lets you do whatever you want, that can be great, if you just want to drive around and take in the sights, or it can be a curse if you're badly ocding on blinking pointers on maps, like i sometimes do. you'll quickly go down the rabbit hole here, also by the game spouting countless and pointless, i might add, outside of xp gain! side missions at you  constantly! it's amazing at how much your journal fills up when you drive around for 10 minutes. it's way too much clutter. if you ignore that bs and just concentrate on the main mission, this game gives you a great 20 or so hours if the internet is to be believed. i'm at the 10h point currently and satisfied so far! speaking of progression the xp system takes a lot of getting used to. its a mix of elder scrolls, aka a skill will develop when you abundantly use it which makes sense, but not really and not only,,, as that is a different experience bar... of which you have one per skill type. to make it more confusing, your main talents are skill based, and depend on how much of your hardearned skill points or here perk points you invest, perk points are independent of skill points, which you use to invest in your main skills in order to unlock higher talent grades and generally making that skill line more powerful  ie you want to build a onemanarmy? invest in brawlerannihilation skills, for which you need to develop your body main talent tree, not only does the game let you do the exploring of that system, it does lock you in as there dont really seem to be reskills available atm in game. go figure. it took me a bit to get this, and im a veteran rpger. choose carefully! pros  story  characters  graphics on pc upwards of nvidia gtx 1070  sound  mix  atmosphere  vast array of moddable, craftable weapons cons  bugs abundantly  the game overburdens you with side quests to the point of overload  dialogs seem too tryhard, and forced at points  progression system can lock you in a build and explains too little  ... and additionally the game does not do a great job of explaining progression choices too well  the mods and weapons are level based and the crafting system is also a mess atm, especially gettting the necessary parts to craft high end gear."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"it took me a lot of time to prepare mentally for this review. i was struggling with my own experience and the reviews and reddit comments and complaints about the game. ultimately  cyberpunk 2077 is a game of a constant emotional rollercoaster, a true game of the decade, a storyline masterpiece with a decent gameplay. sprawling, captivating world, huge, incredibly detailed city which is amazing and overwhelming at the same time, looking at your every move, judging your every dialog choice. as linus from ltt said this is a good looking game and it is, fantastic and breathtaking graphics  with the requirement of having a high end pc which im glad it is like that! id sacrifice ps4 and xbo performance anytime for such a technological advancement. its called moving with the times  im sure there were many games you couldnt play because of your outdated hardware this is such a game and it should be if its supposed to be remembered. anyone who says that this game looks like the characters are made from plastic should get a pair of new glasses, it just isnt the case. insane and incredibly detailed character animations, facial expressions and camera play during dialogues with proper shadows and subsurface scattering makes the characters of the game very believable. a lot of onetimeencounter characters are made with such a detail making most of other games main characters look like lara croft from the 1996 tomb raider. please keep in mind the fact that if the developers focused more on 6 to 7 year old consoles, the game graphics would be on an entirely different level. but getting back to the point, i think cdpr has done it again, and has set a new standard for rpgs and immersive storylines. the game is filled to the brink with content. countless side missions that are so detailed, you sometimes need a reminder that its a side mission and not a story mission. the best story i have ever had in a video game, combined with unmatched graphics and im past the 70 hour mark, with three endings finished back at the beginning of the game smashing through all of the side quests and points of interest still wanting more. the storytelling is just unbelievably good. someone is lying to you? certainly wont look you in the eyes. nervous about a huge score? will develop a shaking leg tics or hold hisher purse nervously. the combat system is ok, its not the most refined system in the world if im honest, but it is satisfying and entertaining, the crafting and perk system might need some refinement but once you unlock some perks the gameplay opens up and gives you a lot of opportunities to shine and do some cool flashy stuff. the thing i was the most worried about was vehicle mechanics, the trailers showed unpromising and clunky driving almost as all of the cars had tires made out of wood. the final product is not perfect but definitely acceptable and enjoyable  i find it a lot better than gta v for example the cars have some sort of suspension at least. my initial impression was like 910, a solid game with some issues and a problematic rushed launch. but as the game opened up, my v started being a real skilled merc, not just a person with a gun and i started being flooded with feelings and emotions portrayed by every single actor together with the games dense and climatic ost i said to myself that this game has to be a solid 1010 and nothing less. i think its one of the best games ever made, surely it has its issues but in its genre and from what i was expecting from cdpr  a masterpiece, breathtaking and emotional storyline with awesome characters and deep backstory it is a real industry changer. waiting patiently with a bag of popcorn for other companies to copy. im also sure that cdpr will deliver and patch the games performance, gameplay systems and ui just as they did with the witcher 3  please just wait. if you enjoy open world rpgs with immersive and emotional storylines, then this game is certainly for you. objectively for anyone to rate the game with 0 is just pure hate. creating long feature lists comparing the game systems to rockstars rdr2 is also pure hate and meaningless. dont listen to that, skip the reddit posts which btw. as of 26th december stopped being pure hate and actually appreciate the game and just enjoy what the game has to offer, dont let them ruin your experience and please see it for yourself. every game is buggy, and cyberpunk is definitely playable and enjoyable with its bugs. enjoy your christmas."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"brilliant job cdpr! great storyline, interesting and diversed sidequests. of course there are many bugs  one bug didn't let me finish all cyberpsycho sidequests but i'll give you credit for that and i'm sure you will fix it. right now i'm getting cp2077 for the second time. thank you cdpr. i'm proud of you. p.s. i love all the references to radiohead and pyramid song. i'm a huge fan. and i was stunned by that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"i'll agree about the bad optimization and it's poor perfomance even on the very high end pc's.. but it's not a reason to shred this masterpiece of game. this game has an awesome story and the best characters i've ever seen in the last few years, i really can remember every character that v has been talked to and it doesnt matter if it was during some side quest that most of you may miss or a main story persona who is deeply involved in the main story of v. glad to see that cdpr successed with their idead although 90 of todays games are being flipped all over to mainatin the lgbt trends. i'm also happy to see that cdpr did't tried to save money on the actors and voice actors cast, and no. i don't speak only about keanu reeves which is obviously a sick choice and i hope he will win some trophies for his actor game, i speak about the voices behind v, judi, panam and even the local fixers which are a common actors mostly. the only reason i gave that masterpiece a solid 8 is bc of the various graphic bugs and the though perfomance."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"a fun game with a great storyline, filled with cool and unique characters. this game is hands down great and definitely not the worst of the year... thing is, expectations of everyone including me were much higher than this game can offer. plain and simple. the world looks incredible and the whole view on the future aspect in cyberpunk is incredible."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"after spending about 50 hours on the pc version of the game, it is a solid 910. for reference, the witcher 3 and rdr2 are 1010, and god of war is a 910, with ghost of tsushima a 8.510. this game is in the same bracket as games such as god of war, gta 5, and skyrim. the only weakness i've seen is the poor ai. as for bugs, in 50 hours i've noticed a character once walk through a car, music stopped playing once and i had to reload the save, and unable to take some trash items from the floor. none of those are game breaking as reported by journalists who played the pre launch beta of the game. my brother did play it on day 1 before nvidia's game ready drivers launched and said it was unplayable. i'm rating this game as a 1010 here to make up for all those kids who have rated the pc version of this game 010 after playing the console version, and those who have rated without even playing the game. for instance, in steam the game has a score of 78 with 225k votes, and once you filter with gametime played, about 110k of them haven't even played the game, and only about 60k of the people who rated the game have spend more than 10 hours in the game. how can one rate a 150 hour game without spending even 10 hours in it? i'm pretty sure metacritic is even worse as anyone can rate here. as for white people who claim the game is racist, you have no idea what discrimination or racism is. i'm a brown guy living in north america. if every white person treated me the way the characters in this game treat each other, that would be a much better world than the north america i live in."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"i played on a well equipped pc. this game has bugs that is annoying and breaks immersion. but i rarely sit through the entire credits roll by and ponder questions unless i've played a really good game or watch a really good movie. this is one of those games. the story, characters, and your choices all come together at the end. you reap what you sow. my ending was fair, brutal and beautiful. pace yourself. spend time to get closer to the characters by doing their side missions. it will change things. i also feel cdpr's version of night city is as it is described in william gibson's book neuromancer with some game adaptations of course. good luck on your journey choomba. and good luck to cdpr with fixing everything that is so obviously broken."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"with 180 hours in, i can now say this game is a 1010, with a minus 2 for the bugs at release. the best story i have ever had in a video game, combined with graphics unmatched on my 3080. characters have tells, lying to you? most likely going to look down and to the left, nervous about a question? she starts tapping her hand holding her purse against her leg. the foreshadowing is sly and well hidden in dialogue, only discovered on my 2nd playthrough. if you don't form an emotional attachment to judy while romancing, do you even feel? the combat system has been amazing, the ai will react to you. if you're pushing in with blades, they back up to a more defensive position. hiding on a roof with a sniper, they will push you hugging the building you're on and trying to stay out of los and climb up on that roof to get you. my first playthrough i went riflessmgssnipers, and now i am using meleeshottieslmg, it changes how i approach every encounter. replayability is through the roof. that being said, i had to reload twice due to bugs in my first playthrough, along with other graphic bugs, how am i still t posing on my bike nekked in 1.06 patch? compared to other games, it is very similiar in day 1 release bugs, less than skyrim by far, more than gta5. the driving is one of my favorite aspects, very controllable, realistic sounds and movements, it took me a while, but i can do a stoppie on command now with almost any bike. once they zoom out your mini map based on speed, it will be perfect. if you enjoy rpgs like the witcher 3, this game is for you. if you are looking to complain cause it's 2020, this game is also for you. because when you only want to see the bad you will, but for anyone to rate this game a 0 on pc is obvious hate. i had this game at an 810 40 hours in, but once the side quests opened up, and feeling the emotions portrayed by every single actor along with one of the best final quests in a game ever, had to drop the 10 bomb. word of advice, research your character build before starting or it will hurt."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"cyberpunk is a great mix of storydriven rpg, loot shooter with tactical elements, and open world game. the world looks stunning, the setting is immersive and the main story is amazing compared to what you see in other games nowadays, but don't make the mistake to stop there. some of the investigative side quests are as good or even better than the main story. they take hours to complete and give the game a whole different, more quiet spin, compared to the actionpacked main storyline. i'm definitely looking forward to more of those. they put a lot of work into the characters and it shows in the animations, dialogue and voice acting. it's these interactions that bring the world to life. there are many characters in cyberpunk that would lend themselves for a spin off or dlc. i liked that the main story isn't too long about 2030 hours i guess. if you want more, there's the mentioned side quest lines, gigs that have you steal something or help someone, some collection quests and typical open world stuff  mostly beating up gangs.  there are some minor bugs that are to be expected and will be fixed without a doubt, but during 100 hours of playing i haven't had any bug that wasn't fixed by saving and reloading. the biggest issue for me is the pop in of npcs and cars. they disappear as soon as they're out of sight, so if you pass someone and then turn around, you'll see a different npc than the one you passed. you won't really notice this if you just go from a to b to do quests, but once you know about it, it's difficult to ignore. when you do something illegal, police are teleported right next to you and that's where it really breaks the immersion a bit. the same goes for races, where your opponents are continuously teleported around you, no matter what happens. the car races in this beautiful world should be a highlight, but like this they're just underwhelming. similarly, npcs have almost no artificial intelligence to speak of. they have a very limited set of things they react to. i'm guessing that this is a direct result of how the npc spawning works, because it's difficult for objects to interact with each other if they just instantly pop in and out of the world. these choices were most likely done for performance reasons and it's the one major thing that the game could do better. if you are looking to interact with the open world a lot, cause trouble and get into police chases, this game is simply not for you. they will have to fix this if they are looking to make an online mode, but the way i play, it hasn't prevented me from enjoying the game.  in the end, cyberpunk is easily among the best i've played. it's like deus ex, but with a much bigger, open world and a more complex skill and item system, if you want to compare it to other games. it's heavily storydriven and the world just serves as a big stage for the quests. you won't find a lot of interaction outside of those quests, so again, to draw a comparison, cyberpunk is not gta in a scifi setting. i haven't watched many trailers up front, so i'm not one of those who are disappointed that this and that didn't make it into the game. instead, i can fully enjoy it for the great game it is. 1010 and my game of the year."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"i enjoyed this game immensely. i played the entire main story, but i have a lot of side quests to complete. and there are a handful of things i need to unlock. this game is an rpg. it is not a gta game, nor is it comparable to red dead, because that is a very different type of game. this is more like witcher 3 with guns. story excellent. well acted, well cast. i enjoyed it. presentation it feels like a real lived in city, its easy to just walk around and get lost. struggling to not spoil anything... night city one of my favorite game environments gameplay gunplay was great, and where the witcher has magic, this has quickhacks that fill the same role. there is a lot of flexibility in how you play and approach combat. you can muscle your way through, or use stealth. its up to you, but you could also just talk your way out of many situations if you make the right choices. its up to you. ok. bugs. yes they exist, and yes they happen. some elements in the game feel incomplete such as the police spawning out of nowhere, the pedestrians just sort of being there with no ai seriously dumb. and the npc driving ai is also very barebones. for a game that is not gta, it needs to take more of a path like gta. some of the bugs made completing specific missions difficult. other bugs were just silly. while i have heard of game breaking bugs, i never encountered any. every now and then i needed to reload a save, but i was able to beat the game regardless. i loved the game, and i am betting that it will improve significantly over the years. i would love more missions that take advantage of the city. they made this huge city, they might as well use it again for other story quests. i see no need to reinvent that wheel when night city is already so great."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"my setting 1080p on pc with keyboard and i7 8700k, rtx 2070 s tech performance graphics are good, but raytracing performance is awful, so i dont use it. dlss in 1080p looks really bad. fps on maximum details with no rt is good. above 50 fps all times the  so many i cant count. graphical, animation, physics, scripts, everything. the game is suffering from to low developement and quality control time. it is clearly a forced release and i feel sorry for the devs. many systems are inplemented but poorly to fit the expectations of the management. some systems doesnt work at all because they are fast scripted to get it in the game. wanted system and cops doesnt work at all, because cops dont recognize crimes, attacking only with deadly force, spawning behind players and so on. the citizens and cars constently spawning behind the player. this is not a bug but intentional programmed to hide the missing dev time when it comes to performance improvements. the whole world seems like a theater, a slight look from the side and the immersion is broken. npcs walking and driving around like robots with no intention, animations and different interactions are missing. there is not much activity to do besides quests and exploring. beside this obviously built in workarounds to get the system in the game the ai is realy bad and stealthy play often fails because of the this and the bugs. design and sound first i dont liked the art style but it fits the setting and after playing a while, i think its good. the music is really pushing in combat and nice when walking driving threw the city as ambience. i like it. story the plot is nice to follow and i like it but it lacks of charakter developement and deepnes. exspecially out of missions it often seems forced and flat."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-26,"first of all let me just say night city looks absolutely beautiful! the side missions and the main story are wonderful to play through and certain aspects of the combat are really fun especially smart weapons that can bend projectile bullets and target enemies over walls, tech weapons that charge up and fire laser beams and quickhacking to devastate groups of enemies. but that's pretty much where the good stuff stops and the negative aspects of cyberpunk 2077 starts showing it's disappointments and flaws. 1. terrible ai overall in the entire game especially from the cops 2. no random encounters in the city not counting marked points of interest already on the map i was expecting random gang shootings, raids on buildings from ncpd, random events happening just by driving around. so far ive played 60 hours and only witnessed one random shooting event that wasn't tied to a mission, it involved security guards and militech shooting at each other which was cool but i was expecting more random events occurring frequently outside of missions. 3. no interactions whatsoever with normal everyday npc's besides shop owners it's just one line sentences when you talk to people. mission related npc's have a  ton more to say to you but when it comes to pedestrian's don't even bother because all they do is keep walking around like zombies. the only time they do something different is when you fire a gun and then they either just run away or cower in crouch mode forever. for night city looking beautiful in terms of the environment it actually feels quite dead since nothing is happening outside of mission's. 4. the police wanted system is terrible, you kill somebody and in a matter of 2 seconds and you are swarmed by like 10 cops and they shoot you to death out of nowhere. you can escape the cops and lose the stars but just by running away or driving down the road you can completely lose the cops which is very unrealistic. 5. very limited on character creation, i can change my junk size but i can't change if i want to be fat or small. which i understand might have to do with keeping in terms of the main story and such but i just wish we were given more freedom on character creation. 6. no way to customize cars that you own? seriously? no way to buy your own property or have a garage? seriously? no way for you to have a proper romance system? seriously? witcher 3 sex scenes were better imo. no way to join factions, destroy factions or have more missions tied to the depths of certain factions? seriously? overall i was very underwhelmed playing this game and that's saying it nicely, yes mission's tied to the friends you make along the way were very good and the main story was good but after that you're stuck with basic fetch me this, fetch me that quests. i was also getting random phone calls from people asking me to do a job for them and it felt very out of place because i had no idea who the hell these people were so it basically meant nothing to me. i swear like 10 random people call me for jobs and im like ok cool but why do i care? it felt like a huge portion of the systems and concepts was cut out due to development decisions and costs? i'm not sure but it definitely shows. i was expecting a lot more from the game that's been in development for so long from cdpr. i'm disappointed but i have been enjoying the game for what it is. 610 it would probably be lower due to the bugs and glitches but i didn't encounter many. the game as of right now is poorly optimized though across the board!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"i have played the entire game, more than 60h, so this isn't a review of 15h of gameplay. i will get the first points out, yes, the game has a lot of glitches and yes, you need a powerful pc. but if you ever had the chance to do anything in unity, unreal engine 4, or any other game engine you would understand why, this is not a big flat map with some repeated assets, gta v is incredible simpler in comparison same with the witcher 3, so from a technical standpoint it's a massive difference in graphic resources. during my gameplay, i have encountered numerous glitches, but none of those have supposed an issue for my experience, more like a laugh or so. the game still a lot of love from cdpr to became what was intended to be, but if your plan is to do the main story and the side quests, the game is fine at is, keeping in mind that you need a decent pc to run it. the level of detail, the art, the voice actors, the story, the choices, are just incredible. at the end of the game you feel almost like if you knew your character, and for the english version i recommend the female v, why? the voice acting is superior to the male version. i give them a 910, knowing that probably in 612months i would gave them a 1010. it has been as incredible as the withcer 3 was, looking forward to see the development of this game through out the next months."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"for me, this game is 100x better than the last of us 2, i actually enjoyed it a lot i know, i know, i mention tlou2 because both are expected to be masterpieces, but it turned out that one is  crap"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,wow there are some bugs!!! but save often and not a problem. other than that the game is beautiful on my 1080ti and the story is top notch. they really paid attention to the little details
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,the story and atmosphere in night city is genius. cyberpunk is my game of the year.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"too much woke sjw. bugs and glitches galore i can't even finish the game. story has its moments, but there is a lot of bad writing for all the good. why are there so many lesbians? there is a lot of content that is missing or chopped off and it is sometimes more than obvious this is the case. a major side story arc doesn't even have a conclusion. i still can't believe there is no consequences for using more implants, even though the lore indicates there should be. this is what happens when a dev team puts diversity over talent. the biggest disappointment in my gaming history."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"i've waited so many years for this game.. it turned out to be a failure, i'm so sorry to say this but i did expect better than this so called action adventure game... i guess i don't need to mention about bugs and crashes.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"disappointing game in all regards except the visual part of it. a lot of bugs, silly story, horrible npcs, boring rpgelements, etc. i regret buying that overhyped game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"short main campaign, funny glitches and still awesome. i'm having a great time with it. i'm playing on a 5yrs old predator laptop and it plays well."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,not paying attention to cosmetic bugs which will surely be fixed the game is phenomenal. hope the ending will be developed in the dlc. that's all i'm waiting for because i'm a bit unsatisfied at the moment.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,honestly a pretty good game with decent variety in combat. ui is a bit clunky. story is also decent. great visuals. yes there are bugs. but haven't experienced anything game breaking. crafting is pretty broken in a fun exploit sorta way. side quests are fun and quirky if you like stories and oddities. some of those del car missions really made me laugh. got about 100 hours in game and about to start second playthrough.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"came to revise my score from the initial 6 to 8. it's decent enough game on a fast pc. the night city looks amazing. its also a fun shooter. writing is shallow, for the most part, and the variety and depth of characters that the witcher series was famous for  is all but gone. the side quests are mostly boring. gone is the detective work. gone are the moral choices. gone are complex characters that seem believable. instead we get hundreds of 1dimensional cliches that are completely forgettable. graphics is amazing btw. wish they took the 6 more months to polish it, it's not like it would be anything less cutting edge in 2021. heck, even in 2022, if the world lasts that long that is. sure looks like they basically turned cdpr into yet another mbaran enterprise with crunch, worker exploitation and focus on timelines, not creativity or quality. sad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,game is amazing on pc best looking game out with rt on night city is stunning story is great too.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,great game. there may be few issues with bugs but i'm pretty sure they will be fixed at some point. amazing story and characters. overall the feeling and the atmosphere are unique. could have been better? yes of course. still a fantastic game. i see many hating on this game and i really don't understand it. if you failed victims to your own hype that's no one's fault but yours. next time set your expectations correctly.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"in this review, i will not include bugs or glitches because they'll eventually get patched. also, in my gameplay, i found near to no bugs and none of them gamebreaking. i currently have 46 hours of gameplay so maybe some things will change as i play more. every bad review says that the world is lifeless and empty. well, you can change that in the settings and it is only empty if your computer is really bad. i have i78th gen and a gtx1060 and with that, i can play at 30 fps in highultra settings. if i put on medium i can get 4050 fps. the game has lots of npc's with amazing stories, but you can't talk with every npc. something that a lot of people thought they would be able to. i actually think this would be a bad thing for the game, but that's my opinion. through my gameplay, i never felt in a lifeless world and it was full of things to do. there is a lot of sidequests and stories, some of them even change the main quests. the feeling that your choices change what is going to happen is always there which only makes things better. as for the story, i understand that some people might not find it very interesting, but in my opinion, it is 1010. the only flaw being that i only found the story interesting enough to make don't want to stop playing for the next 10 hours after some time of gameplay. most people probably get bored of it in the first two missions, when the story heats up after your first big heist. the story gets a little complex, especially if you are not paying 100 attention to what everyone is saying. for some, this can be annoying but i think this only makes the game more immersive. the many endings differ a lot and some minor choices you make throughout your journey will affect how some things roll out, but not enough to call it a new ending. all things considered, cyberpunk 2077 is an awesome game worth buying, if you have an average good pc and enjoy rpg's."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"i know it has some problems, but i didn't have a lot if expectations in the first place, so now i really enjoy it. i hope that people stop being rude and just think about how many troubles cdpr has gone through while making this game. i am absolutely willing to give them time to fix those issues but as in general, i like playing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"one of the best games of the decade in my opinion, rdr2 and cyberpunk 2077 are the two best games since 2000. this game scores above the industry average in every important group of parameters 1 gameplay. combat and stealth are equally satisfying. there is no rpg on the market right now that even comparable to the cp in terms of gunfights, melee fights, and stealth e.g. while shooting in the outer worlds, which is 2 fresh rpg, is somewhat ok, there are ambiguous ammo types and too many indistinguishable guns. smart weapons feel amazing, katana and mantis blades have an enormously satisfying feeling. finally, stealth and hacking are super interesting. the overall gameplay best in the industry comparison deus ex, outer worlds, fallout nv. 2 plot and world. authors tell us an interesting story about death and one's acceptance of it. not really mass effect level of drama or deus ex 1 level of conspiracy, but the deeply private and personal story. side quests are, of course, amazing river ward's and johny's especially. i, personally, liked the plot even more than i liked the plot in new vegas. in addition to that, developers used the universe with developed lore, and the back story of night city and nusa is interesting to learn. finally, every question mark on the map tells a small interesting story or shows a funny place. it feels great to explore the world. of course, it's not the same city as in gta 5, but rpgs never were really about super alive open worlds e.g. new vegas, outer worlds, skyrim, etc.. the overall plot and world best in the industry comparison mass effect, deus ex, outer worlds, fallout nv. 3 roleplaying. roleplaying for me is about two things 1 ability to adjust playstyle combatoriented, charming, stealthy, etc. and 2 ability to express my personal feelings via actionsdialogs. so, 1  playstyle. i see several potential builds here assault rifles with dodges, tank with a shotgun, stealth with hacking. not much, but in deus ex hr we had only 1 build that makes sense  stealth combat is super awkward there, in new vegas we had sniper, assault rifle, talker, melee plus a lot of room for roleplay with additional skills, such as repair or medicine. outer worlds and assassin's creed are nothing in comparison. sub conclusion good level, not the best new vegas, but above the industry average. now, 2  dialogs. yes, that's true, you can only affect the plot so much, but honestly, it's not that kind of rpg that allows you to favor one fraction and destroy the other or that allows you to negotiate in every quest e.g. new vegas, outer worlds. cp is a more cinematiclike game, and in this sense, the only sensible comparison is mass effect, and we can affect the plot way more in cp. but what is more important is dialogues every time i had an option that represents my personal feelings exactly, and all the other options made total sense e.g. in mass effect you had two ways adequate character and crazy cruel  the most important part of the game  v's thoughts about johny and acceptance of death  offer great dialog options, and i personally felt that i hear answers that resonate with me, the player. overall highly above the industry average. 4 artistic execution. music is awesome, all that rocker boy vibe is amazing, the city looks noir af and rain and light works amazing in pre designed scenes and just during any night free ride. in that sense, one can compare cp with rdr2, and cp at least slightly worse in terms of light and scenes. overall absolutely exceptional artistic work. final verdict this game will become legendary and will stay together with rdr 2, new vegas in the rpg's hall of fame. ignore all negative reviews  people just hate technical execution, but this is temporary, while all that i described is way more important."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"first and foremost. i play this game on an i710 series and an geforce 3080 to get all the fanboys out of the way that keep saying that we should upgrade our hardware for this game sadly i still have to give this game a poor rating. i would not go so far and say that it is unplayable on the pc but hear me out the game is not what was promised and not what i expect from cdpr to be an rpg game. not after 'the witcher' it is a solid story shooter in a distopian setting. this is the only reason why i am not giving 0 points. i came to accept that it is a good shooter with good story elements that is buggy now more in depth the immersion does not exist. you don't have any impact on the ai, they repeat the same 5 sentences over and over and while driving the ai stops within the blink of an eye in the middle of the road. police? they bother about you got 2 minutes and then just stand in the middle of the road until you take them out of their misery looks and feel. the cars are all a teeeny bit different but you can see your bugatti or ferrari and no way to 'cyberpunk' your cars in any way. they are stale, boring and if you have seen ten different cars you seen them all bugs there are alot of them. many. some are minor, not disrupting your game play but i myself need to reload every 2030 minutes because my ui becomes unresponsive. i cannot pick up 30 of the loot. it just cannot be picked up. 50of the time i need to look somewhere different to pick them up the other day my character suddenly took out his weapon and emptied his magazine in the npc in front of me you see a car, look away and turn around and there's a different car or the car is gone. and yes i see that as a bug because it breaks the game play and the options you have you safe a game while crouched behind an enemy. if you reload the enemy is either somewhere else or faces you. overall this game is by far not even close to what promised, however if the bugs get fixed it is a solid story shooter with nice visuals"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"on pc, this was absolutely the game i was looking for. it is a high end game made for pc gamers first. it's funny, if cdpr had dialed back the game and made a more mass market game, they would have gotten flak for not going all out. here we are, they created a pc first game and they are getting flak for the console releases. of course, cdpr deserves some of that as this is how it was marketed, but if you are a pc gamer with an above average pc with a rtx card, you will enjoy it. v is not as a good a character as geralt, but the massive world more than fills the gap. i just end up coming back to it. there is great ambition in the world building and it is the star of the show. take some great set piece moments in the storyline and the fact that any quest can take an unexpected direction, and this is a great time. thanks cdpr for making a pc gamers game, as usual."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"i must admit that i am disappointed with this game, having looked forward to it for quite some time. i don't think it's terrible, but i also don't think it's particularly good. on a fairly highend pc it's a really nice looking game but even from a graphical standpoint it's got some problems. the draw distance is good, but there is some really significant popin, which is most noticeable when travelling in a car or on a bike. the difference in how much time was spent on the main and side characters versus the npcs is also very obvious and quite jarring. main characters such as jackie welles, judy alvarez, etc are all very detailed and have clearly been given a lot of time and effort, but your average citizen of night city is quite low detail and quite often i'd see exact replica npcs standing next to each other in a crowd. beyond the graphics i think there are some real problems with this game, and the worrying thing is that some of it is probably beyond fixing. there are a lot of bugs and minor issues, such as clipping, items floating in midair, cars sinking into the floor, etc, all of which will be fixed in updates. beyond that there are problems with a lack of interaction with your average npc, and a physics engine that is poor even when compared to the 7 year old gtav. however, for me the biggest problem is that this game seems to only superficially be an rpg. yes, the game features stats, character attributes that you can unlock and mods that can be applied to guns to change the damage output, but beyond the first 1520 minutes none of the dialogue choices really seem to make a difference to the outcome of game events, which is a major issue for an rpg. at the start of the game you choose between playing as nomad, street kid or corpo. sometimes in dialogue you'll get a different choice pop up depending on which character start you chose, but ultimately none of it seems to make a difference to the outcome of the conversation. i feel like cp2077 has a really cool setting, with a nicely designed if quite shallow city, and the graphics can be really impressive at times, but ultimately i think the game is really disappointing."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"i played the game for 70 hours before writing this and finished it. did to my knowledge most of the interesting side quests too. the good  story most immersive story in a game to date. yes it is fairly linear but the same goes for all similar games. diversity always comes at the cost of immersion.  graphics it looks amazing. sure, it could have still been better in certain aspects but for the type of game it is, it does not have a lot of competition  music for me personally the one area where it actually has no competition. i do realise it caters towards my preferences while most games do not but at the same time there's a lot of music in there that is definitely not for me so i'm sure it pleases a wide crowd. in the 70 hours i never got bored of the music which is the first time that happens in a game.  fps it's essentially a good fps game and i often resorted to shooting as the best solution questionable  the skill tree it's generally not usefulnecessary enough to get into it. sure in a second play through i'd go specifically for those things that have some use but you can finish the game leaving a lot of points uninvested.  stealthhacking it has its uses but it's often rather tedious and after a few failures it's often clear you might as well just walk in with the intent and the tactic to kill everyone even in situations where you're supposed to be stealthy  lack of true nextgen open world there's nothing really ground breaking about the open world implementation the bad  glitches while there are no major gamebreaking bugs, there are plenty of storybreaking glitches. people showing up in places they are not supposed to be, walking through objects, inconsistent conversations. overall they are easy enough to overlook but it's obvious that most of these are easy to fix. unfortunately makes it still feel like a bit of a rushed job.  open world npc ai we're 2020, it really takes minimal effort get open world ai to be better than what it is  mini games racing, boxing they bothered to weave some into the story but actually didn't bother to add them as a pass time for the open world plus add some more one thing that i see pop up a lot and i don't know why is driving and more specifically handling. personally i don't get the complaints. it's actually fairly straightforward and easy to get to grips with how vehicles handle. especially motorbikes. i have hardly used fast travel as a result and just drove around all the time while enjoying the music."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"there might not be anything i can say about this game that hasn't already been said. i made an account to review it anyway, because i was just as excited as everyone else for its release. maybe significantly moreso. many people's expectations may have been too high. personally, i expected a full finished product that would contain at least the majority of the systems and features advertised. that is not what i got. i understand that many things will be cut out and reworked in the process of game development. this is inevitable. i was not blind to the does not represent final product warning labels in the teasers and trailers. however, most of the time this message is viewed positively. it implies the game will be more polished, more fleshed out, and more complete than what you're seeing. in cyberpunk's case, they cut out the game itself. that warning message acted as a shield against accountability rather than a promising reassurance that the game would get better. intentional or not. this is not an rpg. cyberpunk 2077 is a mediocre mess. a heartbreaking one. it absolutely shines in a few areas, is passable in many, and is absolutely embarrassing in some. the story, although good and even emotionally impactful at times, suffers from the poor choice made to cut out what was likely going to be an additional act to the game in favor of an odd and unsatisfying montage summarization. how much was actually cut from the story i'll never know, but there is something huge missing here especially and i felt it. like losing an arm but constantly being treated as though i'd never had two in the first place. v is not your character. most of your choices are meaningless. v will frequently say things with no input from you that destroys any vision of what or who your character is to you. unless   street kid is what you envisioned. v is a vehicle for you to experience johnny's story and the stories of the other characters around you. who, admittedly, are mostly very good. the customization is just okay. a shadow of what it could have been. then again, what is the point of customization when you almost never see your character in any meaningful way? third person cutscenes are almost entirely nonexistent. you can look in mirrors, but why? it happens twice naturally in the story, and half the time pieces of clothing or hair won't load in properly. mirrors would be a nice little addition if they didn't remind me that the character i spent my time creating may as well be imaginary unless i bend over a bathroom sink and stare at him doing nothing. the city is the most beautiful city ever made in a video game. it's also completely shallow and boring beyond being a set piece to do missions in. they sprinkled in a few secrets and scripted events, but not many and not enough to satisfy, it only makes me want more. the police and a.i. in npcs is extremely bad. this has been said many times by people more knowledgable and well spoken than me, but it absoltely cannot be overstated and should be yelled out from the rooftops at any opportunity. it is embarrassing and almost insulting. this can never be okay in a full priced game. ridiculous. unbelievable. this is a lopsided, gutted, abused 610 game that is treading water solely on the talent that surrounds it. the art, the music, the acting and writing in most cases prop up this husk of a shell  and allow it to be something i would consider worth playing. no amount of bug fixes will improve its score beyond a 7. what this game needs is meat. features. activities. repair. remodeling. so much about it feels incomplete and butchered that it screams out to anyone paying attention that it was meant to be something very different. there is a 910 experience somewhere in this mess. they have the foundation. will updates and dlc transform this game over the years and turn it into a product that's not only flashy and cool but satisfying? i don't know enough about game development to understand what they can or can't do to fix this. or if they'll even try or recognize what's broken. but i hope they do. my heart sank at the end of my playthrough when the honeymoon phase ended and it began to sink in just how much of this game was missing. for every bit of fun i had, there were 2 somber realizations that i couldn't do or see something that i wanted to or was told i could. cyberpunk is a lot like the hurried montage it used to replace an entire act of the game. flashy and full of good characters, but hollow and unsatisfying. no video game has ever let me down more than this one. i remain optimistic about its future, however, and hope both cdred and the people who trusted them end up as happy with the outcome as possible."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,"after finishing the game with a runtime of 50 hours i can safely say that cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game with some minor setbacks that ultimately haven't spoiled my experience at all. the gameplay features fairly common fps mechanics that become more fun, varied and engaging as you start unlocking perks and installing new cyberwear. i would say that the worst thing about the game is the ai, which sometimes may seem sluggish or downright stupid. however the amazing narrative that has been carefully woven maintains a sky high quality throughout the game and different type of quests, creating an amazing world in which you will feel inmersed the outstanding soundtrack also helps with this. if someone asked me if heshe should play cyberpunk 2077 i would certainly encourage him to. however seeing how the game has launched perhaps it would be wise to wait a few months so that the game is more polished. personally i played in a laptop with a gtx 1660ti and a ryzen 4800h in high preset and i didn't run into any mayor issues mantaining around 60fps. regarding bugs my experience has also been relatively good. i found only some visual bugs, minor niusances like objects that get stuck in the air in conversations from time to time, nothing gamebreaking."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-25,there are too many issues in this game that you cannot ignore. one of my biggest issues is the joke of the checkpoints  i'm having checkpoints at times when i'm about to die. the mission where you have to get the flathead makes a checkpoint where you can get detected by the cameras and midway through killing one of the npcs  i have about 19 health when i start the checkpoint and sometimes even when i mash the shoot button i will still die instantly. this is just absolutely shocking and should not be released when this happens. glad the keybinding issue was fixed fairly early as not being able to do this as a leftie would have docked the score a couple points down to 4. graphics are decent but nothing spectacular. game overall seems very convoluted with the power ups etc. way too complicated  just make it a simple rpg where you level your characters like on mass effect. no need for all the ridiculous customisation. gameplay is good when it works  7 graphics  8 ease  3 longevity  9 clearly there's a lot to do in the game which saves this from a very low score from me. fix the crippling issues in game with all the bugs and the absolute joke of the checkpoint issues and it'll get an 8.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"i wrote a review before this one and i gave it a 1010 but i was only 10 to 15 hours in the game. but now after playing 90 hours i think i know what's wrong with cp2077. in 2018, we were promised a very deep and detailed rpg with no punches being pulled and many other great things like a cutting edge npc system, a very deep general ai and interactivity on par with gta v or rdr2, heavy focus on rpg elements and player choice being extremely important etc... it was said that cp2077 is first and foremost an rpg and shooter elements are secondary, the city is extremely detailed and interactivity is like nothing we have seen before and the list goes on. the game was intended and marketed for hardcore rpg gamers and we thought that we'd be playing cp2077 for at least 2 years because of its depth, variety, replayability, and interactivity. this is where everything falls apart. ultimately this game as of this moment is intended for average players who want to kill some time and rest from a long work day. the game that was promised to us in 2018 is non existent now and this is why the rpg elements like player choice, customization, the life paths and the class system suffer from design choices that no amount of updates and patches are able to fix. the customization both for your character and the things you own is second to none, the clothing options are very limited and v can hardly look good. for example, i wanted to make my carefully created female v to look sexy in skimpy and neon colored clothing and look like the moxes but the game threw me the lamest clothing options which are ridiculous why and how does a tank top give me 230 armor???? clothing aside there is the horrendous system that doesn't allow you to change v's appearance, give them tattoos or at least change their hairstyle and color how can you not include in game customization????? the weapons are great themselves but i want just more than slapping a scope and calling it a day where are the skins and dye systems like in the witcher 3?? the npc system is perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of the game, they are not alive in any shape or form and don't react properly to the world around them. every day i ask myself, why and how did they market this game the way they did and did they know that this game was far from finished??? aside from all the problems, i believe that there is a masterpiece hidden under the game we have now. night city is easily the most beautiful city that i've ever seen in a game there are many moment when you see a stairway in the middle of the street and when you walk in, you find yourself in a whole different part of the city. the cyberpunk theme is implemented masterfully and it can drown you in its aesthetics. the music absolutely amazing and masterful. but, this hidden masterpiece was never delivered to us because of one sole factor, m o n e y. the managers at cdpr wanted to release the game at any cost to cash in and leave but that proved disastrous. this game needed at least one more year to finish because in my opinion, 70 of the game is missing. this is most evident in the game's story the story is disappointingly short and rushed af. in the end, all i can say is that cp2077 was rushed and wasn't even close to release but i want to believe that after a year or two, cdpr will deliver on the actual cyberpunk 2077, the game we were waiting on for almost 10 years.. i'll give this game a 710 now and i hope to come back in a year or two to make this 7 a 10.. let's fking go cdpr, get it together."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"granted this is an early review of the game i've managed about 10hrs due to workcovidchristmasstudy commitments, i feel like i've got to put my 2 pence in. i am playing on xbox series x and was initially disappointed. the game overloads you with information from the off, it felt weird to play and of course there were the bugs, due to which i had to restart a quest a couple of times. after grinning and bearing through the bugs, i slowly but surely fell in love with the characters, the gameplay and the witcher 3 familiarity of the whole package. i can now see that there is a hugely impressive game underneath the dirty, misleading vale which has been cast over the cyberpunk and cdpr name. give this game a chance. it's only going to get better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"absolutely love this game, bought a series x just to play it. no crashes or bugs so far.. 1.06. one of the best games i've ever played and i'm 51!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"never thought i would say this about cyberpunk, the ''overhyped'' game. if you can look past the bugs, this is a top notch game with an incredible story. dont let the negative review bombs fool you. this is a review for pc, console is a different story.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"wer eine ps4 oder xbox one besitzt sollte das spiel nicht spielen!!! die graphik,npcs,autos sind nicht programmiert auf die consolen zur laufen. cyberpunk ist ein gutes spiel und wer das genieen mchte sollte auf die pc version zugreifen."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"my honest review after 70 hours of gameplay, mostly on patch 1.04. about 510 hours on 1.05 and a tiny little bit on 1.06 the game is still essentially an alpha build. today, on pc, it may be transitioning into beta. on this site, as expected, you'll mostly find people giving the game a 10 or a 0, both of which are of course wrong and not representative of the game's true state. either way, there are plenty of things the game does right, and just as many things it does wrong. for the purpose of this review i will solely be reviewing the game itself and not taking into consideration the dubious and outright fraudulent actions of cdpr. pros and cons are listed below. pros  the narrative  that is, the writing of dialogue and portrayal of the lore throughout the main storyline and side quests. this is what carries the game.  a beautifully crafted and detailed night city.  character design and artstyle.  the natural, almost organic design of quest progression.  the graphics and implementation of ray tracing.  the audio design and soundscape. cons  while the story is what carries the game, it is painfully obvious that a lot of content has been cut which would have enriched it considerably. a prime example of this can be seen in the many sequences shown in trailers of v's and jackie's escapades, presumably depicting how they grew close, only for none of that to be included in the game.  incredibly mediocre gameplay. shooting has very little impact and melee is gimmicky.  poor to nonexistent ai. police system is atrocious, npcs do not drive cars outside of scripted events in the main storyline, enemies are dumber than in certain games from the early 2000's.  ui is a cluttered mess and generally, the lootershooter aspect of this game is very poorly implemented.  the character progression element is simultaneously cluttered, confusing, superficial and ultimately unrewarding except for a select few choices, which in turn break the game in your favor.  the lack of qualityoflife features such as any type of appearance changer is just sad.  the hundreds upon hundreds of bugs. even on pc, this is no joke. for a game that relies heavily on immersion, you will find it broken every 10 minutes or so by a car exploding and launching into the sky. this is one of the tamer bugs, by the way as there are gamebreaking ones as well.  extremely poor optimization. ray tracing aside, there is absolutely no reason this game should run as poorly as it does on relatively highend hardware. all in all, there is a foundation upon which this game can grow. is that an excuse for a shoddy, early release? absolutely not. do i believe this game will one day be good? perhaps. as it stands today, i cannot recommend cyberpunk 2077. perhaps in 12 years, when gameplay aspects and technical issues will have been refined and hammered out, the game will be what it was advertised to be. free dlc, if made well, will certainly go a long way in addressing many of the game's issues and broken promises. right now, on pc, patch 1.06, the game is a weak 610. just barely crossing the line of mediocrity, mostly due to its narrative and aesthetics. yes, it was overhyped, however, even with lower expectations it still underdelivered overall. do not purchase this game unless you're fully aware of its shortcomings and still wish to play it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"i don't think i ever gave a zero to a game. but in cyberpunk 2077, marketing and reality are lightyears apart. and many game review sites played along and didn't call out the game for what it is a generic shooter rpg and an unfinished mess. cdprs reputation won't recover from this. i feel scammed!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"despite all the stories, the complaints.... it's a work of genius, it has flaws sure, but it has so much emotion, it has brilliant story, it has amazing gun fights and character interactions that will make you laugh out loud or shed a tear. 130 hours played and not a one regretted, play it, enjoy it, make up your own mind choom."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"the game is just okay, and thats it. ignoring the immense amount of bugs and the bad performance and optimization on most platforms, the game has a nonexistent ai, a painful combat system, a rough driving, an average and linear narrative, ps3 physics, and what is worse, a city that, despite being beautiful, is empty. the design of the city is incredible, but there is absolutely nothing to do in it. the art of cyberpunk 2077 is by far the best part of the title, because beyond that, it is a game that, if it had been made by another studio other than cd proyekt, would have been absolutely destroyed by the critics. in my opinion, the game needed at least three more years of development, two for content and one more to polish detailsfix bugs. cyberpunk 2077, despite being 9 years in development, has less content than a 2013 and past generation game like gta v, which also had a relatively similar development time. furthermore, it is impossible to ignore the fact that cd proyekt deceived its players by showing them a product that differed greatly from the final result. in short, cyberpunk 2077 is a game that had everything to be one of the best games ever created, but thanks to the immense expectation of it, it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the decade, and what is worse, destroying the reputation of a study that had proved to be different from the others."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"a forgettable experience. i tried so hard to ignore the massive motitude of bugs, but those are not the main problem of this game. this is a bare bones rpg, with a beautiful but empty city. the ai is ridicolous and lifeless, the cop system is a joke and there are no activities other than copy paste contracts. the main and secondary quests are really well written, but the interactivity is just fake. there are meaningless decisions, you just choose which quote to hear that points to the same outcome. so on the paper, this is just a story driven game with multiple endings, not a real rpg. the world is not impacted at all, regardless what you do in the quests, except that the completion of one of those leads to an additional slighly different ending. what about the character building? pointless. there are so many situations with poor level design, that led my character with no constitution to frustrating scripted ambushes, meaning one hit death. i was forced to cheat a mission to avoid constantly dying without any other possibility. it's also pointless to present a crafting system when you constantly drop higher level gear from enemies, and you cannot just pretend that they're not on the floor, since the ui is so oppressive and you can't neither disable it through the so limited options menu. nice marketing, but at what cost? you lost all my trust cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"i will try to make it short. the best part is the worldcity, characters, dialogues, story with side quests. there is a lot to do. it took me 45 hours to finish the game and it was not boring. i liked it a lot!!! every other aspect of the game is really good quality. i mean fight, crafting, character progress etc. i can not give 1010 because of downgrade graphics, glitches, and dead city. that last part you will not fill if you play side quests. but if you like to explore the city you can fill the emptiness."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"i would be lying if i said this game doesn't have it's fair share of issues. i'm not going to give a detailed review but i am very close to 100 completion and here are my procon bullet points. simply put though, i very much enjoy this game overall even though i of course wish some things were different or more fleshed out. pros  fantastic dialogue and voice acting performances  beautiful world building and exploration, the city is aweinspiring to traverse  fun gameplay loop with diverse character building options  great stories, both the main story and many of the side gigs  amazing sound design and music the vehicles, guns, and people really sound great  the graphics are fantastic this is specific to the pc version although with the caveat that it isn't currently welloptimized cons  pretty lifeless ai, aside from scripted events which are amazing, the rest of the npcs are just kind of there, which wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't extend to combat ai as well  combat can be very easy, this is kind of an extension of my previous point. i have no basis for comparison but stealthquickhacking is unbelievably overpowered. by level 25 after focusing on intelligencequick hacking i am able to kill 20 enemies in less than 30 seconds with a combination of legendary ping and contagion. on top of that, the ai is just simply not intelligent.  the ui for inventory isn't very streamlined, crafting takes forever if you're making multiples of something and its just kind of clunky. for instance if you want to disassemble a bunch of items you have to hold down a button for each one, whereas in many rpgs you can select multiple things and click disassemble all selected items or some such thing  it should be obvious to everyone by now there are quite a few glitches. tbh i've encountered very few bugs that actually affected gameplay, not to say i haven't seen any but it has been rare in my 60 hours so far. however, visual bugs happen quite frequently, although they don't have any real effect on my experience other than a loss of immersion"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"this review is for platforms that are currently playable pc  next gen consoles. i played on a new pc with nvidia 3080 for gpu. visuals gorgeous!. night city and surrounding areas are a treat, with lighting and reflections that make most prior games look flat in  you can run this with raytracing pc now, next gen consoles in 2021 update then for graphics fans it may worth a purchase if only to take in the sights. soundtrack is fun and as expected leans mostly towards electronica, dance, andor noisemetal. it's a little too obviously current for my tastes, and i wish they had been a little more forwardthinking in their original music, but still well done if you're a fan of those styles. atmosphere at first i felt the vision of 2077 felt incredibly unoriginal and oldfashioned. but, once i learned it was based on the cyberpunk rpg from the 90s then it made sense they're being faithful to a vision of a cyberpunk future that now feels more quaint than edgy. as with the music, i wish they would have been more forwardthinking and come up with a modern take on the cyberpunk genre rather than going for highly accurate reproduction of an old vision. but, hey, they did a really good job of bringing that old vision to life. gameplay bugs. yes, many bugs. but on the platforms i'm reviewing they are manageable, albeit annoying. text for dialogue that sticks on the screen until you reload, quest steps that don't trigger properly until you reload, getting stuck until you reload are all things that have happened to me on an occasional basis. not enough to make me want to stop, but enough to annoy me. these will be fixed, and anyone not tolerant of jank in their games should wait about 3 months or so. acting so far i've only played male v, and the voice actor comes from the school of if i growl my lines i'll sound edgy. it's mostly a onenote performance that occasionally has better moments. but, really v is there just to prompt the other characters to speak, and they carry the bulk of the stories' emotional weight and impact. jackie, judy, river, panam, mitch, evelyn, and others are very engaging and i grew to appreciate and like them very much. some people have expressed disappointment at keanu reeve's performance as johnny silverhand, but i've always found his acting style to be oddly stilted and emotionally flat so it's very much what i expected. so, not great, but yeah it's keanu being keanu and i was ok with it. character advancement a wide variety of attributes and perks that mesh together in interesting ways. some of them sound uninspiring in their descriptions, and most of these are more incremental than radical in how they affect your gameplay, but those increments sure do add up and in the latter part of the game you will start to feel how much more capable your character is. i went with an intelligencestealthtech build with an emphasis on quickhacks. i was quite the glass cannon but had lots of fun with the combat. inducing cyberpsychosis is great fun just watch your enemies tear each other apart while you loot the goodies. open world the ai for pedestrians and cars is rock stupid, and there are many times you'll be soaking in the sights only to have jittery pedestrians or stalled traffic interfere with your immersion. i still enjoyed moving through the world, but i suspect things will be much smoother in a couple months. romancesstorylineoptions most dialogue options feel fairly unimportant, just adding color to your v and allowing you to steer himher to sounding vague, surly, or supportive. i've only experienced a couple of the endings so far, and what's clear is that doings lots of side jobs and gigs is important to having more options at the end. don't rush the main story!! there aren't lots of cool little things to discover in the world, making it feel bland and repetitive after a while. character story arcs can be emotional and moving, but there's nothing nextgen about the game design itself. overall i'm having a great time wcyberpunk despite its limitations. i love open worlds, and anticipate playing at least a couple dozen hours more. if you go in with realistic expectations it can provide many hours of fun. it's no masterpiece, but there are more than a few fun, interesting stories to be told in night city, and i'm glad i got it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"after a while you loose the fun in that game cause the city is not interactive enough and citizens wont react to your playstyle. there are no things to do, no social reactions or economy. the physics are dull and early 90s style. if they wanted to make a deus ex  they dont have to create a whole city of that size. its a very very good deus ex next gen. i also see the potential of this game and it can go easy 1010 next year and i will update my rating cause the story mode part is great and the shooting feels very good. things to do  physics everything should react like in rdr2 and others  ai game is to easy  npc withe daily routines  life  reactions  police system  economy in the city all should feel connected  more houses to enter and break in  storys and quests that envolves randomly because of your actions in the city  overall performance gfx i think time and modding will lift it to another level. they shouldnt release it and put at least 612 months into it to fulfill the vision. if anything changes to the positive i will upvote the game. therewhile i will play rdr2, assasins creed valhalla, kingdom come dlcs, skyrim with mods!!, workers  resources soviet republic. this game is cp is a good base to start for the publisher and the modding secene but it feeld after a while lifeless. that doesnt mean that the city is not a blast. its just there for aesthetic reasons and thats why its a shame they released it in that state. merry xmass gonna dl valhalla now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"it's just a masterpiece. the best game in the last 5 years. i just don't understand why this game has such low ratings, the project itself is very unique in its genre. you won't believe me, but i remember all the names of the key characters, and in some cases the surnames. v is not some kind of mannequin, he is a human and it is surprising that the character does not immediately prepare as geralt or ellie, we create his appearance ourselves and throughout the game i fell in love with my v. the endings make me think about a lot"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"i must say that i have been extremely disappointed by cyberpunk 2077. the game is just nothing close to what they said it would be .... i feel like the only thing they've been honest about is the quality graphics. to be more specific, the world is lifeless. you can't interact with anything or talk to anyone . there is nothing to do in the city outside of scripted missions . citizens behavior is comparable to what was done during the ps2 generation no joke . there's not even a single animation if you go to the bar to get a drink for example or go get something to eat or small stuff like that. the lifepaths basically change nothing except the beginning of prologue . can't buy apartments, can't customize cars. there's just zero roleplay value . you can't shoot from your car and police can't even use vehicles or pursue you at all . they just spawn on your position and kill you. globally, everything in the game feel poorly made and rushed. it feels like no love or heart was put in making this game. everything is aesthetic only . beyond that, everything is made far better in basically any other game . i can't get to understand how it can take so many years to create such a poor quality game. cd projekt red repeatedly lied to us . they presented the game as 10x times more advanced and complex than what it really is."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"night city is the city i was dreaming of. characters, quests, story and gameplay are aligned with my expectations. i'm writing this after 60 hours into this game. i'm removing one point from my rating because of the  those are not present enough to make me hate this game. of course if you are doing stupid things with your character or your vehicles you will meet a lot of them. but the whole game is a great experience, very addictive, if you are a newgen player. if you are a oldgen player, please be patient and stop rating this game in the pc section like a whining hater."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"a very soulful game. this atmosphere, these emotions will not be covered by any bug, and besides, i did not come across so many of them..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,i played the game for over 90 hours on pc. the game is missing a lot of features they boast about in the game. the game is also not an rpg game like they said before release and later on after the game's launch they changed the game to action game on their store. the ai for the police and npcs are poor. the police wont chase after the player or chase player in a car like in gta v. npcs in cyberpunk 2077 world feels so staticextremely poor reactions toward whatever the player is doing around them . the game is littered with visual glitches and bugs to a point where it breaks the game immersion to the player. 3rd person view cutscenes is only used at the game's ending and removed for all other missions. player can't customize their character after creating it or even change their hair cut. the mini map is extremely poor to a point were a player can miss a right or a left turn while driving because the mini map doesn't even zoom out while driving fast. driving a car or a bike in cyberpunk is really not a good experience driving feels heavy and annoying to some point..player can't customize their car. no cutscenes for ripperdocs when adding new cybernetics. the world of cyberpunk 2077 feels empty and lifeless thanks to the poor ai design in this game and the removed features. 90 of dialogs in this game have no consequences whatsoever to the final ending of the game. the in game economy is broken and needs to be balanced. buying cars and bikes system is extremely bad too. and the list of things that i found troubling in this game can go on forever to be honest. this game needs 1 or 2 more years of development.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"this game is honestly pretty good. a lot of the negative reviews seem to be coming from the game being overhyped, people with too high expectations, and the company doing what pretty much every company has done in the same situation. like people wanted a next gen game, well they got it then complained it wouldn't run on last gen consoles. they wanted it out now when the devs said it's not ready and they got the game out like everyone wanted but, surprise it wasn't ready. i walked i to it with out watching a single trailer or knowing anything about it. ive only encountered 2 bugs in my playthrough but they seem to have been patched out since they only happened once. but looking at this game for what it is, not what you wanted it to be, it's a really fun game with interesting character, a great story, and endless fun to find."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"very unimpressed with cyberpunk. nothing is novel, it's a punkish spiced latte of a safe and un challenging rpg. tldr hacking is boring, driving is bad, clipping is so poor, ai is poor, physics are poor, the game isn't near ready, let alone finished give it two years. in the 30 hours i have played it was barely enjoyable as an rpg. on the positive the story is quite interesting, and the music good  however you are never  in like in other rpg's. this is possibly because your life choices in the game barely matter, and the cyber punk feel never really gets off, as you can barely interact with anything. the ever present clipping bugs, the ai when driving is dire, combat requires no thought, driving and crash physics are tediously poor, dropped items stuck in clipping, unusable shops, pointless food, poor npc dialogue, people spawning and disappearing in front of you, tech weapons fire through walls or any other object with no hindrance, hacking is boring and childishly easy and the mini map is useless for driving navigation. the only interesting and wellthoughtout objective is the main quest. utter wasted potential, after a few hours it becomes a collect a slightly better weapon and gear game. if you expected cyber innovation, or believed any of the hype, you are probably going to have to wait a long time for the modders to make it enjoyable."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"hilariously awful! this game has been hyped to kingdom come. after years of anticipation and several delays, gamers were optimistic to receive an optimized, bugfree game after all, the developers took their time to straighten out all the kinks, right? wrong. upon installing the game and its very large dayone patch, i was surprised to see that the game many thought to become the game of the century was so badly optimized, that my pc system running a gtx1070 could not even handle the game on the lowest settings. gameplaywise the game has absolutely nothing to offer what other games hadn't done before. in fact, many aspects of the game feel outdated and unnecessarily clunky. stealth is a joke you can only silently take out an enemy when you are behind them. while you can use hacking to temporarily disable their vision, you're still not able to grab them from in front. i have played the game for more than thirty hours at this point and cyberpunk 2077 has been more than disappointing throughout. my main focus in the game so far has been the countless sidequests. in terms of the main story, i'm about 60 done. many have said the story makes up for the performance issues, the bugs, the glitches, but i don't support that argument. surely the story isn't a bad one, but in my opinion, it doesn't even come close to the likes of the outer worlds, red dead redemption 2, or even fallout. in the same way, the city of night city feels as dead as v when they were launched into the air after kicking a trashbag while the scifi buildings, cars, and weapons might be somewhat pretty to look at, nothing in this world seems alive. npcs don't react to the player at all. if you stand in the road, you'll be run over. if you're in the way of a pedestrian, they will walk right through you. the cars are simply there to be an obstacle for you in traffic or for you to jack should you be in dire need of a vehicle, which, on a sidenote, the game tries really hard for you not to be since you will get a message every so often asking you to buy a car you will never afford. i have found that if i play anything other than the main story, my game crashes every five to ten minutes. it freezes, it outright crashes, and it even bluescreened my pc once. i do not understand how such a broken game passed cdpr's quality control if there ever was any. summary  awful performance  unnecessary bugs and glitches  lackluster gameplay mechanics  outdated feel  broken car physics  an empty world with dead npcs  not worth the money as of december 2020"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"if you have strong pc cyberpunk is best game ever, if you have gtx 1050 ti cyberpunk is disappointment. and i played with rtx 2070s. this game is an unforgettable experience for me. i wish they continue the story with dlc"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,there is some good here. the game is pretty. combat is fun to a point. the story and character are good. unfortunately cp2077 falls well short not simply on its advertised promises but in creating a complete experience in general. what is good doesn't stand out far enough to make up for its deep shortcomings. 180 hrs into the game and there is little left to do. do not mistake this for an open world rpg. this is a very large and pretty world that keeps you on rails throughout the story and side missions. there is no way or reason to live in night city as it is not a living world. very disappointed in every aspect presented in this title. don't buy for a long while if at all. this is a one and done.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"really cool open world action rpg, i'd say gameplay wise this game is like a cross between fallout and saints row. stylistically though it seems to be like deus ex meets blade runner. 810"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"the game is great, i mean yeah sure there are things that are not that was promised, but the game excels anyway, waaaaaaay better than the average triple a game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,the game has a really good story and side quests and probably the best game world and atmosphere that any game had so far. the game play is not perfect but it is fun and it has enough variety. the only problem is the lack of choice to influence the story and the world and the police that spawns right next to you when you commit a crime.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"i give 5 because 6 would have been a game not perfect but good enough to spend time with if i'm passionate about the genre. i think that all the fuzz about the bugs are kinda missing the point. this game has no heart and is just bad writing. no characters to love, no reasons to chat with an npc. everything is cute and shallow. even the estetic choices you can make are not enough in a game where nothing is worth of attention, and we already had games with far better character customization even xenoblade chronicles x for wii u has a better character custom. talking about technical stuff the ai is just terrible spawning police as you move the camera is something terrible. just because cdpr didn't know how to make the ai reach that point in the map. even the way that v sleep in his bed is... just silly. all that creates suspension of disbelief, and actually breaks the game in his roots. in the end i get that cyberpunk is about cyborgs. but gamers are still humans."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"russian voice of keanu reeves is so disgusting. dear american's imagine that when you see keanu and he start speak you hear voice of tobey maguire. how tasty?    ,     ,    100  .    ,      , ,  .      ,   ,    ,   ,       .         .   ,          ,  cdpr            .         ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"the game in itself is pretty damn good. gameplay mechanics need a bit of polishing, as do vehicles. enemies feel a bit ..dumb. found myself a number of times overestimating the enemies just to come to realize i could pistol 20 people no problem. also, goin through the trouble to create genitalia just to show a pair of breasts once in a companion interaction is useless and dumb.cars feel pretty dumb too and there is no crash mechanic on a  are virtually a god. other than that, it runs and looks amazing even on lowest settings with refelctions on, on a 1060 and i5 and 16gigs of ram. story is very catchy and interesting. gun looting and upgradingcrafting is pretty cool. overall it deserves some love and some patches but it s still a pretty solid game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"beside the bugs and the glitches the game was surprisingly good story wise, some game mechanic like driving felt a bit off and the combat felt a bit slow but good overall especially with the hacking mechanic which give you more ways to play the game helps being stealthy.i just wish it was more polished when it was released."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"if you liked to play the cyberpunk story game and you liked the concept or you are interested in such a vision of the future or the present  cyberpunk 2020 and you have a good pc or any pc or any device, e.g. tv with the stadia app, then this game is for you and you will be delighted. the story line, characters, dialogues, the complexity of the world, graphics, music, the choice of how you experience the game give you a lot of satisfaction and make you immerse yourself in it for hours. this is what i expected."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"yes they messed up releasing it undercooked on last gen consoles but played as it's meant to be played this is one very nice game. very immersive story and missions, particularly when you try to achieve an objective using hackingstealth. i agree that the ai could use a little work but it's not as bad as some people say, playing it on hardvery hard makes up for this as you can't take as many hits. update your drivers and play above the minimum specs and you're in for a treat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"great game overall. pretty buggy on release but getting better with every patch. interesting main and side stories with unexpected twists, cool characters. a true graphically impressive benchmark for modern rigs. unfortunately, partially ruined because of pastgen consoles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,overall i really enjoyed the game and got pretty much exactly what i expected. the game is very much like the witcher just in a different setting it isn't revolutionary but a good game. of course i kept my expectations realistic and didn't buy into the hype exaggeration. that isn't to say the game was perfect and i do have some feedbackcriticism. overall though you will get your money's worth any score of below a 3 or a 10 isn't being honest so ignore those.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"would be a shame if the ps4 and woke army manage to destroy this company. second best european open world rpg lately after horizon and easily one of the best this century. had no real crash in a 60 hr playthrough on a one x, love the story , it's a great shenmue , observer , blade runner mashup with some fallout new vegas great dark vibe and techno critique , even a standout reeves performance. legendary soundtrack as well . philip k and stanislaw lem would approve."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"dont buy this game. this game has worse physics and combat than fallout 4. this game is secretly made by bugthesda, trust me"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-24,"for some reason i gave this game a chance even after i played the witcher 3, arguably the most overrated game in recent memory. the only good aspect of that game was the story telling and writing, which is the only mediocre aspect of cyberpunk 2077. the game is a bugged mess and has crashed on me more times than skyrim, fallout 4, fallout 76 and ac unity have... combined, all of which i also played at launch. outside of all the bad publicity this game has, the biggest issue i have seen neglected from most reviewers is that this game has the same speech option system as fallout 4, that being no speech options, as you are given the illusion of choice and that most speech trees mean absoultly nothing. also the gunplay is complete and utter  but this was to be expected considering cd project red has never made a first person shooter ever. i miss headshots constantly which has never happened to me in borderlands the superior looter shooter. last but not least, why in the hell crafting allowed if its impossible to get materials needed and even when you get the materials your save will get to large and corrupt itself. 15th of the skills in the game are linked to crafting. cd project red is now in a league of its own below 1000 tonnes of  far under the likes of ubisoft, bethesda, ea ect. at least you know those companies make ty games that run."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"potential is there and it really was a fun game but so many bugs, issues with basic mechanics, terrible rendering, zero customization, very linear, and the end game makes no sense. these are all things that could be finetuned to win goty, however, based on this terrible release i would keep this at a 5 since it was fun but zero immersion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"performance on my 8 core amd 2700 cpu is pretty bad. so many bugs and cut corners. i'm not playing anymore until it is fixed, it is a waste of money at the moment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"the storyacting is remarkable. the game and its atmosphere are visually stunning. in my playthrough i experienced no gamebreaking bugs and the performance was about what i'd expect from my pc. guneplay was nothing spectacular although the quick hacks were a neat feature which made stealth more fun. in my opinion though, what made this game great was the main story and the side storylines all of which i found to be very enjoyable. unfortunate that players on last gen console can't have the same experience as me though."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"amazing graphics and story. i was expexting witcher in cyberpunk setting and got that. if you were expexting gta6 you might fill dissapointed, but open world is still great just needs some tweaks ie police spawming"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"ill give 2 points to the story, 1 point to the barely achievable graphics. the rest it filled with bugs, bugs and lazyness. this is supposed to ba an open world game in the year 2077. did cops loose their cars?? wai wait.. ambulance troopers recieved flying tanks, cops got onetimeuse teleportation to 5 meters behind you? hah! i hate this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"a flawed gem that deserves more dev time i wrote a much longer review than can be put here with the character limit, i guess. just finished my first playthrough clocking in at well over 100 hours. tldr played on a decent rig, didn't have gamebreaking bugs, enjoyed the gameplay for the most part side missions and open world feel quite shallow, more often than not beautiful core story that will stick with me abridged cyberpunk 2077 has been a truly bittersweet experience. released too soon, but never soon enough. weighted down by bad management decisions and by insanely high expectations from gamers, initially when i loaded it i was in awe, taking in the scenery around me, the sheer scale of the city, the beautiful crafting of the main story missions. it was when the open world part of the open world really got exposed that i saw how empty it really was. the ai around me, the lack of meaningful small interactions in a way that, for instance red dead redemption 2 handled brilliantly and side activities... the essence of most side missions boiling down to go to place, kill bad guys... i'm still glad i played it. that mixture of awe and disappointment, as with most things in life, is just gonna be part of the experience. i recommend this game to anyone who loves the genre, and anyone who loves good storytelling. if you're hoping for the next big revolutionary step forward in gaming, however, you will be disappointed. i sincerely hope this game sticks around, and never fades away, and that, like witcher 3 and no man's sky, the more time passes, the more it becomes that thing that everyone praises. i hope that it can be saved from the poor management decisions that ultimately led to disappointment... much like the choices my v made in the end. i'd like to think that she, and cdpr, deserve one last chance to correct their course."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"after nearly 200 hours of gameplay, i can say this is among the most enjoyable games that i have played. i am nowhere near finished playing either. the most notable in this game is the story. cyberpunk 2077 feels more like a movie with a video game inside, when doing the main story. the brilliant writing, voice acting, soundtrack and more, makes this game among one of my all time favorite games. the options and branching of the story is also enjoyable, as well as background specific quests, that build depth to how the story fits the unique background and choices. for the obvious, the graphics are fantastic. the game looks amazing and the presentation and environment is very visually appealing. i can drive around the city and enjoy the presentation, or run around into the more narrow areas, and appreciate the many extremely detailed areas that this game has to offer. in all, the city keeps showing me new things that i have not yet seen. the controls are phenomenal, except when it comes to driving. this game definitely benefits from the controller when behind the wheel. i also feel that the melee combat is a bit lacking, and feels to be button mashing when all is said and done. however, the sneaking and firearms are extremely enjoyable. i enjoy doing missions without ever being detected, using the cyber skills and ranged weapons, or sneaking behind the enemy and putting them into a choke hold. cyberpunk makes covert play very enjoyable. the driving on the keyboard is very lacking, as it is a balance of tapping and gauging how much or little your vehicle will steer. i am sure this will be altered or adjusted in time, but i am getting better at it. i find myself sometimes just unable to avoid slamming into the poor bystanders on the sidewalk, just staring in horror at my ping pong style of driving. my biggest complaint is how much of this highly detailed world seems to be locked and unavailable. so many doors are locked, but i take hope that the fact they show locked with an interaction is a sign this will not always be this way. i am also hopeful for more interactions with the environment, such as arcades. i spent many hours playing gwent in witcher 3, the arcade games in fo4, and so forth with the minigames. my second complaint is the police, whom seem to be terrible annoying. many times, i wish there was an option to turn them off, and is the only reason i am not playing on the hardest difficulty. there are times that i cross their view in narrow passages, and they attack me for simply passing by, such as the path up and down from the apartment of v. i am hopeful that this changes as well. my third complaint is the number of times that i skip dialogue, because i am trying to stand up. i play the game sneaking most of the missions, and find myself skipping initial conversations, needing to reload to see what i missed. cyberpunk 2077 runs far smoother and with far less problems than my initial experience with fo4, but comes with its own unique issues. regardless, this game is amazing and definitely worth the experience. even with my complaints, this game is a 1010 for me in value and enjoyment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,i loved this game! great characters and fun gameplay. its a little bit easy but thats okay.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"90 of my play time 45hours on the 1.04 version the rest on the 1.05, first off graphics and sound are top notch, runs smooth 60 fps on ultra at 2560x1080 219 on my 5700xt. i have had 3 ctds, and have had to load 70100 times due to bugs and glitches. the city looks good and has a lot of attitude, the factions are diverse, you can tell time went into this. however this game was not ready for a full release. it is a decent sized and well filled out game world that feels surprisingly dead other then interaction with main plot line cast. there is minimal interaction with npcs, which is mostly them screaming and running into the street to be run over by your wildly uncontrollable car which feels like it has a small metal post under it where it turns from. the melee combat is ... well its crap. the shooting feels spot on but its not that hard to make a decent shooter these days. the ai is mostly stupid, they just hide behind crates and pop up to shoot once in a while and rarely flank, it is very easy to just skirt the edge of a combat zone and shoot in. if you spec'd in the tech tree you can shoot through cover. like a buildings worth of it. i am on hard difficultly if that makes a difference to anyone. also most of my deaths have been from something i didn't see near me exploding, as every combat zone is littered with explosive tanks, generators and vehicles. when you have had enough combat and feel like driving around and exploring pick a slow car with good breaks, otherwise, well get used to your car lifting off the ground while cornering, or hitting a small bump, or going up or down hill. overall if you really want to play through it in the current state its playable on pc if you dont mind a lot of bugs, but would be much better a few months down the line with bug fixes, lots of qol updates and the rest of the game mechanics in and functioning. this is very clearly a kick it out the door the shareholders want a big q4 for more  we will deal with in it post."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,if they released this game when it was ready... if would be a 10. game is broken. story and design is beautiful tho... the only problem is that the game needed more time to fix the bugs and make the game good. it looks like a beta

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"it's funny how polarizing reviews for this are. it's like politics. too many of the reviews are only about if someone can handle bugs or not. the premise of the game is a strong 89, good story if a little shallow, but mostly suffers for the perceived depth really just being a ton of repetitive side missions just like gta5 or rdr. hold on... both of them launched with massive bugs too but get better reviews cause rockstar gets worshipped? i'd have liked the overall story arc to have more twists and branches but the foundation is there for a truly great game. if you have no patience for bugs wait a few months for them to get ironed out. if you're used to beta releases which most modern games are anyways at least on pc the bugs aren't really game breaking. i played through to the end with about 70 side mission completion and never crashed once but seen plenty of collision issues and graphical glitches. rockstar needs to take note on what cdpr did right which is character customization would be more meaningful in 3rd person, statsupgradability on gear and weapons and multiple paths for the story to take. without the bugs it's a solid 89, i knocked 1 off for the beta condition but i'm not a child that gives it a 0, demands a refund, then freaks when steam expects the game back too. this is actually happening and a sad testament to today's modern entitled gamer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"she may be a buggy mess of a world. but she's my buggy mess. and i love and appreciate the game on the inside. the core of this game is a ball of a time. i cant put it down. its a massive drive from one side quest to the next and it never ends. like that first boss isn't gonna be ready. because my op walking god that is v will show no mercy. which is how it feels trying to tackle all these side quests before tackling the story. there's no mercy just do it, figure it out and move on to the next one. you don't have time to plan where you go because within that time you've already stumbled onto another side quest. the grinds been kinda nice. and the rewards. who doesn't love spending all them grinded cyber hours away creating your perfect warrior. only buy cyberwear and mods. everything else dismantle for crafting material. if there's nothing you haven't already found that you like. don't worry you can just keep upgrading that crazy over powered sniper rifle that one hits everything to pieces from the dismantled materials of your fallen victims. don't worry you'll find that one perfect gun in time. just keep upgrading and dismantling everything till you do. you don't have to pick everything up after killing an entire ally but your gonna want to dismantle there crap for your stock piling of future crafting goodies. sure the games not perfect, how many open world games are first release. i'm very much enjoying this game. if you can looking past a few bugs which i've only had a few annoying encounters nothing crazy. and im playing on ps4 pro mind you. even tho the sneaking mechanic and npc's in combat have a iq of potato. im still really enjoying it. haven't put it down since it released. the game has minor problems i can look past. nothing like what i've heard from some and im playing on a ps4 pro. and its still a beautiful game to walk around in. sure when driving fast and getting out real quick to look at a blank wall or a npc the textures may take a moment to render in. if you can look past those minor misfortunes. there is a fun and beautiful world to be held and explored. bugs an all. its my buggy  show. no mercy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,i play on stadia. game and story are exactly as i thought and hoped during the hype. i am happy with it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"currently unplayable, as the game inexplicably does not allow rebinding the up or down arrow keys for onfoot movement vehicular movement is fine, for some reason, and f is set as the permanent default for most confirmation prompts. i absolutely refuse to use the leftside oriented wasd keyboard layout, and attempting to edit the config files as some guides suggest online has only managed to break the game, as in it won't accept any key commands. i've already wasted hours trying to figure out which combination of edits the game will accept without breaking. absurd and outrageous, particularly given that you could bind almost all functions in witcher 3. leaving a score of 0 because the game doesn't work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"game, no customization of vehicles or character, clothing is horrible, gameplay is horrible and annoying, not funny at all, physics are terrible, and the story is bland with johnny silverhand being the only good thing in the entire game seriously, the witcher 3 is my favorite game of the generation and you come up with this crap? what did you spend 7 years into?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"it's a good game, but not amazing in any area. meaningful character choices are lacking, combat is what you would expect from a decent shooter, story is alright. i'm not as impressed with the graphics as everyone seems to be, but then again i can't use ray tracing. the bugs..well they go without saying. silly visual glitches, crappy ai, texture popping. the game needed longer in development just to get it pc ready, let alone for consoles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"fantastic art and assets for use in a future finished product. looks like most funding was pulled recently  since we're in a global depression. too bad because they really oversold it. the game plays and runs great even on my very very old x5690  980ti, the gameplay is snappy but lacks depth and roleplay balance e.g. lategame fistsonly was easy  highest difficulty. the driving physics are better than gtav but not gtaiv which was very surprising, the world and story are great, but lack connectivity. it looks like cdpr will bundle the ip and resell it to another major studio by the looks of it 100 focus on art assets. hopefully microsoftbethesda will pick up the ip and make something that works. the soundmusic really stunk, they used a cheap 3rd party deal, late in the pipeline. great to see pondsmith finally getting paid tho..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"well, not much to say above any other previous review. lots of the advertised features are nonexistent, such as  graphics as in the first gameplay trailers especially quality of shadows, city interaction, verticality of the city, customization, real variability of cars, police ai. biggest disappointment of the year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"yo all these ps4 and rockstar fan boys need to stay out of this thread. stick to your respective platforms. this game is good, and on my pc rtx 2070 super and a ryzen 3600x it runs very well. there are some things wrong but they will definitely patch them. for real, shame on any of you for even thinking this game would run on your last gen piece of  get with the times, this game is far better than skyrim or gta5. as for the rockstar fanboys enjoy playing games with a vast open world where the developers only utilize 20 of it during the story mode and milk you for years with online content that most people don't want. ps4 is trash and these review bombs are trash, go do something else while i enjoy playing the game. anyone one else reading this the game is for sure worth giving a shot, there will be plenty of free updates and they are patching it constantly. everything that is wrong with the game currently is fixable. the amount of sub 15 year olds in this thread smh, your parents should pay attention to the rating on the box."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"some great things the game delivers visuals main story side quests characters world and lore soundtrack but... visuals are not perfect  details pop in all the time when driving, lod is even worse than witcher 3 in some places and that was a major complaint. story is great, but there's just not much of it  we get 3 acts in theory, in practice it feels like prologue, act 2, epilogue. the world is superficial, once you take a closer look you realize there's nothing to do in it outside of quests. sound  while main soundtrack is very good, radio stations feel extremely limited. interesting but half done ideas rogue ais, blackwall  we barely get a glimpse of it. badlands  almost nothing to do there. we have all these interesting gangs and factions in night city and do nothing with them. something on gameplay... good parts lots of fun with hacking, every mission has tons of objects to interact with. several ways to approach each mission. some cool ideas for weapons. skill trees are a huge improvement over w3 and there's a lot of fun to be had with different builds. some cool implant ideas. mantis blades, kerezhnikov etz. issues with what is there hacking the minigame we have is cool but gets tiring halfway through the game, if we're going with minigames me2 at least had a few different ones. not enough quickhacks, i ended up using 23 most of the time and i focused on a netrunner build with int and perks into it. weapons there's plenty of weapons in the game but many feel the same and that's a problem when you focus on one skill tree. implants after we get the eye implant, every other one feels like buying a new gun at the store. there should be some sort of animation and more effect in appearance. this is a major theme in the genre. missing and broken parts crafting doesn't feel finished. we barely get any schematics, upgrading is not balanced with economy and leveling. no customization for crafted items, random stats? another half done feature. driving is horrible. every ride needs tons of space to turn at higher speed and it just doesn't feel right when driving around. lots of qol improvements needed for inventory and ui. loot system when i can get rare weapons worse than common ones, something just feels off. there's no point in buying guns or armor, you quickly find something better by looting. tutorials game fails to explain it's features, i often had to look up how to do something on google, or to understand how some mechanic works. ui game just doesn't show me information i need very often, mostly for weapons. broken or missing stuff in general bugs and crashes it's one of the worst releases in that regard i can remember. witcher 3 had problems at launch but it was nowhere this close. 99 of the time save and reload fixed it but it just takes you out of the game. i stopped counting how many crashes i got after the first act. lifepaths are a joke the way they were portrayed in promo material everyone expected much more than what we got. we were told they will increase replayability. they don't. they don't matter at all. all that focus on clothes and style in marketing has nothing to do with the game from player's perspective. ai for crowds and police crowds are decorations, they were more interactive in gta san andreas released on ps2. cars move on rails, ai is almost nonexistent. police is broken, no other way to describe it. character creator and customization extremely limited and you can see why  there's no point in it, we don't see v almost at all. whole thing looks like a marketing ploy to get headlines about genitals customization. implants don't change appearance except for mantis blades and hand ones. no way to even get a haircut later. it's 2077, we should be able to do ridiculous things for customization and what we have is more limited than witcher 3. false advertising what we saw in the trailers and materials was cherry picked, these parts are great but rest of the game is not like it. game was hyped up by developers as a revolutionary thing. it's nowhere close to that except maybe the huge city and visuals. i've seen some senior devs on twitter blaming it on unrealistic expectations but that just isn't fair. all my prerelease exposure to the game was official promo materials, and i got the same impressions as what to expect as many others did. marketing created the unrealistic expectations, no one else. some parts are greatly detailed, some are barely there just to have something. this is a good game at the end of the day, but not the innovation everyone was expecting. what we got is an unfinished product, and even if we ignore bugs it's simply not what the marketing showed us. last time i was disappointed with a game like that was with me andromeda. and cp77 is definitely better, but also we were told to expect much more than with andromeda."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"not only is the game non functional on many platforms that the game released on, the platforms it does work on offers pathetic performance as well as weirdly aggressive and immersion breaking occlusion culling. avoid if you have an amd card. the story is, ehh, okay... its clear that cd projekt's writing team doesn't understand cyberpunk as a genre, and night city feels like a cheap imitation of what a polish writing room thinks los angeles is like. keanu's performance is good, but it feels like a stunt casting, and he still feels like an odd choice for the role of johnny, who, again, is written...kinda poorly. overall, the game doesnt work, and if it did, i'd still have a hard time suggesting it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"who thought it was fine to release a unfinished game? this game is a literal scam, do not buy"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"the game is an unpolished masterpiece. the glitches like a character stuck in a tpose for a split second or a character not moving their lips for the first half of a sentence in a robust dialogue, although very minor, were plenty. i've experienced a ctd twice and no other major bugs during 50 hours of gameplay. having this out of the way, let's focus on what's important the storytelling was the best i've ever seen in a game. the characters were memorable and believable. johnny silverhand, who is stuck in the player's head is one of the most interesting story devices and personalities in the history of gaming. the city is big and beautifully crafted, with a huge attention to detail. this is an rpg, so the character builds greatly vary in how they're played. i've played as a sneaky male hacker and a one punch woman and the way i'd have to approach dealing with potential threats couldn't have been any more different. what is lacking here is the overall balance e.g. the melee fighter could tank almost anything including heavy guns and grenades but would get one shotted by exploding gas canisters, the athletics skill is progressed by sprinting or punching air and therefore is a pain in the arse to level up. another thing that was a pain to look at was the ai of pedestrians, drivers and the overall design of how police and crime work. driving cars is quite decent but motorcycles jump up and down as if made of rubber. hopefully these will be ironed out by further patches. overall this is a huge game and the bugs and glitches only affect very minor aspects of the gameplay, whose focus is on storytelling and making choices. i recommend it to anybody with a decent pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"okay, aside from all the points other people are making about the game being broken, not being delivered what was promised, unfocused narrative, etc... there are straight up entire scenes without foley. how  deep in the pipeline did cdpr have their sound teams. ouch"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"too many missing features, way too many bugs, lied about console performance, and main story too short for 8 years of development. this game does nothing new and even what it does try to do is done better in other games. lost hours of progress from bugs that forced me to reload old saves. this was one of the most disappointing games ever to me. adding cdpr to the list with ea, ubisoft, blizzard, etc. it really is a shame."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"tldr  so i see some people have issues with the game, others don't. i'm one of those that don't. it's a masterpiece. not flawless that is, but none the less awesome in it's worldbuilding, quests and characters. for starters i'm running this on highultra on a 2070 super, ryzen 3700x, 32gb ram, auorus ssd, rtx on, dlss on auto. sooooo a rather decent rig i would  god tier but not bad either. maybe that is the major issue, the game is not optimized at all. some slower systems might and possibly will not manage and due to some strange driver issue it seems that 30xx nvidia gpus have some serious problems as of now might have changed by the time you're reading this. i don't know why cdpr thought it would be a good idea to promote a 1060 gtx as the recommended gpu or why they thought as ps4 without the pro would be able to handle this, but i guess there are stock market rules that i don't understand and that force developers to make annoucements and promisses, they know they can't uphold. so performance wise it runs smooth as hell, for the most part on my system. sometimes fps drops down to 2030 but gets back to nearly 60 after 5 minutes or so. so i guess it might be more of an cpu issue when there's much to load up. 's good. really good. if you liked the witcher games, you'll love this. it's mature, full of solid writing and difficult themes. this might be a problem for younger gamers tho. woah, hear me out on this! some of us who grew up with shadowrun, blade runner and stuff like that just feel this world in a different kind of way. there's a connection to the worldbuilding, the npcs and the quests. it's difficult to explain but trust me there's some nice stuff in there, that just get's you when you're the right kind of person. if however you don't get any of the themes here, you might just as well skip the game. it opens up to you if you're into the whole cyberpunk theme but if you're not i can see why the overall theme might just as well be another open world shooterrpg with no real depth to it. on the gameplay side, it's complicated. it has it's flaws with being overly compicated, having clunky menus and far too much customization options that you probably won't use, but on the other hand, if you're willing to take your time and take it slow, there's soooo much to do. yeah you can rush trough the main story in about 25 hours. but where's the fun in that? you can put 100somewhat hours into it with side quests, activities and lore in one playtrought! there are several different endings and options, depending on your origins you can choose one of three, so replayability is there. stealth, guns blazing or a mix in between, every quest gig can be solved in many different ways, so yeah it's all there. after 79 years of developement this game is not yet finished. but it's pretty close to being and it's a rollercoaster worth getting on a couple  you have the hardware to actually get things done here."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"this is a review played on a pc with a 1080ti after 80 hours of game play. cyber punk is a mix of some of my favorite games gta v for its open world, fallout for its character building and dialog, borderlands for its weapon variety. i would say its biggest failing is that wasn't as polished as a rockstar game. but it still is far more stable and less glitchy than any of bethesda's open world endeavors. do set your expectations correctly. while this is an open rpg to some extent, you are forced through the story, particularly in the beginning. you can only play in first person, except while you drive. which is probably a good thing, since most of the time what you are wearing looks ridiculous. early on you are swamped with missions, none are time critical, but pacing could use some work. it feels like everything happens in one day. the citizens are just window dressing, more similar to gta than fallout or skyrim. the way the game engine handles stuff out of your vision feels more like gta 3 than gta v. you will have some glitches, but saves are fast along with loading. now for the good. the story and its integration with the side quests is excellent. the ways in which you can build your character really lends itself to a second or third play through, aided by being able to play as male or female, and different dialog choices. an example of the diversity of character creation, my current character primarily uses handtohand combat, and doesn't have the ability to hack. even limited as such, the game plays great. i love literally jumping into combat, sprinting from enemy to enemy and a clobber them with my cybernetic enhanced arms. while not perfect, this is the most fun i've had in a game in a long time. if you like fps action rpgs, the cyber punk setting, and have a highend computer i definitely recommend this. if your computer is a bit weaker or you play on console, you may want to wait a bit, hopefully some optimizing will come, making it more playable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i've hit 70 hours playtime and begun my second play through. i feel i'm now in a position to give a proper review of the game. yes there are bugs but i've never ran into anything game breaking or a simple reload could not fix. the main story and character arcs had a level of polish that doesn't exist for the side missions and random encounters. initially i felt the gun play really clunky but as i leveled up and invested skill points into gun handling it all turned around, fights became satisfying and very responsive. even more so after applying mods to reduce recoil etc. some enemies are bullet sponges but you have to realise this is an rpg game, if mobs feel too difficult it's because you haven't leveled up enough. ai definitely requires tuning. during fire fights many of them would just stand behind cover and let you pick them off one by one. and yes you can obtain weapons with bullet penetration making it even easier. i would have preferred if the game had more emphasis on the various corporations in nc and have a reputation system that unlocks missionsgear while becoming hostile with others. it's the perfect setting for this mechanic since the whole back story is corps gaining power while screwing over others. graphics wise this is the best i've seen where various materials look very realistic. my 2080ti with rtx on might have something to do with that while averaging 70fps on ultra. characters is where this game excels. the voice acting, directing and character story arcs is simply the most well made i've seen in a video game. the game has about 5 endings and the characters drop you video messages depending on the choices you make. my goodness some of these videos hit hard... this is the most time i've invested into a video game in a about a decade. while i find it's still unfinished and has a dumbed down hacking mini game, the content it offers blows other aaa games out the water and most importantly i'm having a blast playing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,i really wanted to give higher score. i really didn't want to be disappointed by this game either. it's so sad. 8 years to this messy messy launch and this messy messy game. you were supposed to be the chosen one cdpr but you're just another ea. i can't even get a refund because i played too long apparently. i was trying to give y'all a chance but you lied and lied and continued to lie. i have lost all faith in humanity. thank you.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"the game has a lot of stuff mission or not implemented yet. you stay every 10 minutes to sell the stuff you don't need or dismantle. you get almost nothing for over 50 items sold or dismantled. you can't order items by price, you can't add to favorite the items you like, you can't sell or dismantle multiple items at once. for a game that you play a lot you waste way to much in menu getting rid of useless stuff because you can't carry more or you have no eddies. you have a lot of options but the mission at least at start still end the same way even the dialog is the same most of the times, even if you picked something else. the clothes may have legendary stats but they are ugly or at least doesn't work with the rest of the stuff  it doesn't matter if you're a girl or man, the clothes you get are the same. even so i had and still have a lot of fun with this game, something that i don't get from games that are fully polished. i enjoy night city. an open world game that it's not made to be long and empty, it feels like it's a real city. everything looks so cool, cars, city, people, weapons, ads. music is good. i didn't finish the game. i will change this review after future updates and after finishing everything but for now the came can't be more than 6.5. you need to restart the game sometimes, because of some bugs i have a 2060 super. the game works at 60 fps easy but with ray tracing on it's 30 so ray tracing is useless even if you may see 10 better lighting in a few places. people are overselling this ray tracing stuff. i prefer 60 stable fps at least instead of some better lighting in a very few areas that you barely notice. some stories with some characters seem generic. it's sad that in 8 years they couldn't take the wither formula and improve it with the side missions. it's not bad, it's easy over what 99 does for side missions, but didn't feel like they were important even if some are and they matter, it wasn't like the wither where i cared a lot more for the side missions. my advice? wait for an update that can fix the important bugs and where they start implementing more into the game. if you can wait 6 months or 1 year it's possible to have the best game ever with a lot of cool stuff and even at a very low price. now? if you have nothing better to play like yakuza  like a dragon i think the game deserves to be played. i have fun with it, a lot of stuff looks great, the story and even side missions are interesting and fun. just remember that the game has more updates until it's close to finished. i find it fun even now because so me bugs can make things very funny but if you want to enjoy the story it will be very hard when lip sinking doesn't work sometimes, the audio is broken other times, characters go crazy, things explode. 100 you can't take the story serious with so many bugs happening from time to time. don't get me wrong, it was even over 5 hours sometimes when i never found an important bugs, just some small and barely noticeable loading issues for textures. i don't regret buying this game, it deserves the money, but they need to fix it and implement a lot of stuff that the game lacks. i also love the fact that they don't censorship a lot of stuff but you have the option to do it and i love that. who wants a censored game, they can have that, but if you want nudity and don't care? you also can do that. nobody should force us accept censorship, this should only be picked by the player. i never pay for censorship and i tank cyberpunk 2077 for making a great job. the developers did a great job but too bad the people in command didn't let them finish the game. i'm sure they are disappointed and they wanted everybody to enjoy the game they made, after they finished it. i'm sorry that i have to give it this review, but it is what it is, for now. later i'm sure i will give this a max score and a 7 is not bad for now, i just hope the developers can finish the game as they wanted from the start. a game like as big as complex like this will always have a lot of bugs, i just hope the ones that are all over the place and annoyinggame breaking will be fixed. now i'm going back to enjoy the game. see ya. gig closed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"short, spoiler free review for ya, choompa loompa my friend and i both beat this game in around 40 hours after doing tons of side quests and sightseeing. despite getting lucky and encountering no major bugs, we were both dismayed by the lack of actual choice in the game, with only the first few hours and the last few hours actually having differences between our profiles. we tried to get different outcomes in side and main quests with mainly no success. i'm sure that by now you've seen the articles about how few choices actually matter in this game and we can vouch for them. the gunplay will often be the most solid part of the cp2077 gameplay experience and it's fine. just okay. the ai is terrible and well, they're not insanely fun to fight or anything... i like the characters. i love the characters. decent movie, horrible game. so... here it is. 9 years of development. cyberpunk is 20 to 70 hours of actual content. short for an rpg. new vegas  around 40 to 150 hrs, the witcher 3  around 60 to 200 hrs of content.  the cops can't drive or chase you. taxis and trams don't exist. the life paths amount to nothing. you cannot rob people, or even point your gun at random shopkeeps let alone characters. just trying to prepare ya. the early reviews for this game were 9s and 10s by the likes of ign. those are the reviews that we saw before starting our profiles. like a slap to the face. an rpg through and through. ign... just over there lying to people. that or they had so much fun they forgot to do their job. either way, i feel mislead that's for sure."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,even with the bugs and bad launch. i still believe this has the bones to be a masterpiece. 70 hours in and i love the experience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"this game is unplayable at this point in time if you want to set your own keybindings. in my case, i have a problem with my fingers that makes wasd an impossibility for me. thus i use arrow keys and in it's current state, the game does not allow you to rebind a lot of keys, like f for interaction or i for inventory. sure, there are numerous usersubmitted workarounds, but the long and short of it is that one should not have to resort to editing config files. we did that stuff in the 90s in the doom era for mods. it wasn't fun then and it sure as hell isn't fun now. another issue is performance and stability, this game has none of those things. 50 of the time when i attempt to start the game, it crashes immediately. when it does start, even on low with a computer that's above the minimum specs, i still have less than 10fps in most instances while playing. this is inexcusable cdpr. i would expected this kind of behavior from ea, or ubisoft, or blizzard, but not from you. you were supposed to be the star everyone else followed. and look at you now. my advice is to let this sit for six months in limbo and then buy a discounted version that's gotten patched well. this is not ready for prime time, it's unplayable."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i preorder the game about a month before release, mostly because i am a huge fan of the witcher trilogy yes, all of them. unfortunately, cdpr has shown its true colour as another megacorporation that thinks is fine to lie to consumers. i am not talking about the bugs, but the game is very average and i really don't understand how people can have the guts to still defend it. the systems and mechanics are a joke, the story average at  on youtube and look at the comparison between cyberpunk 2077 and gta iv and v yes, 4 and it kick cyberpunk ass. the witcher 3 was a much better game, and i don't know if the hired incompetents people or  they had 8 years to develop this....8 years! coming up with all this lies and an average game is just not acceptable. by the way, i have completed the game 80 hours so i am not talking just for the  game is average, the mechanics and systems are better in games 10 years older, cdpr lied on purpose."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"its honestly meh at best  fully deserved 5  art and world while they look fantastic, its all incredibly bland, boring and superficial with nothing to do in. the main story is the only reason this game doesn't completely fail so its got 1 thing going for it, not worth full price tho in the slightest  wait for a massive discount even on pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"this game, besides the decent storyline, substories, and beautiful design aesthetics is just a shell of a shallow game with zero immersion. there is literally nothing to do in the world you can't customize yourself or add cybernetics as advertised, you can't get a haircut, you can't go clubbing, you can't even eat. point is, this is a beautiful cardboard world that crumbles into emptiness once you try touching it, contrary to the epic expansive narrative cdpr's marketing pushed rigorously. and i haven't even mentioned the billions of gamebreaking bugs, astonishingly unintelligent npc ais, and broken police system. as an rpg game cp2077 is just subpar even taking into account the wellwritten stories. oh, and of course there is the limited review process controversy for consoles and save file corruption mess that adds to the woeful mess that is cp 2077."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"les bugs se corrigent. cependant le game play n'est pas fameux. nous sommes sur un banal fps sans grande saveur. en aucun cas nous pouvons parler de rpg. le personnage de v est un un mercenaire avec une identit impose. nous ne pouvons pas choisir sa voie. pas de bon, mauvais, neutre la natation est digne d'un film de srie z. il y a pourtant des uvres intressante qui auraient pu tre utilis gibson, asimov, spinrad,.... cd projet  prfr faire du netflix sans ambition. a trop vouloir ratisser large on perd les fans. nous sommes loin de l'merveillement de la qute du baron rouge, l'inquitante tractation avec les moires, la panique de jeter un bb dans un four. dans cyberpunk 2077, ils ont choisi un scnario crit par un matre de jeux ringard, ne connaissant pas son sujet, ayant une image dplorable du mouvement punk et ne traitant la question du transhumanisme non par des uvres comme neuromancien, acclrando, le samoura virtuel, ghost in the shell, etc etc, mais uniquement par des rsums et des pages wiki. c'est trist de pitiner comme cela un mouvement littraire aussi riche. il parat que les patrons voulaient pas entendre de synthewave dans le jeux. domage car la musique du jeu est souvent mal choisie. bref je met zro car le jeux est une purge au vue de leurs ambitions et du mensonge envers les consommateurs j'attendais un chef d'uvre, j'ai le droit  un mauvais film"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"after 100 hours in the game i can only say this game is a thing of beauty .. i know .... patch it, edit balancing and wanted system and here we go goty 2021"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"in a way, cyberpunk 2077 is like night city a promise that, in reality, never amounted to anything but a lie. an illusion, which seems real enough to trick you or, at least, make you keep playing. maybe in a few months or years, when the bugs are fixed, performance is optimized and several game mechanics are rebalanced and  or completely reformulated, then maybe cyberpunk will come close to what was promised. right now, the moment that truly matters, it is an incomplete game and a big disappointment. unless you are a big fan of the cyberpunk genre and can't wait to experience the story of v and johnny silverhand, but also have a lot of patience to deal with various bugs that will constantly take you out of the experience, i recommend completely avoiding the game and hoping it'll luckily be in a better state in the future. if not, at least it will be cheaper."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,open world in cyberpunk 2077 is empty and lifeless. not even comparable to gta 5 and everyone who are trying to say why you compare it to gta 5. i'm comparing it to gta 5 because they promoted cyberpunk 2077 as next generation of open world games. only way to do next generation of open world games is beating gta 5. it's that simple.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"played on a laptop with a gtx2060, 6 core 12 thread amd ryzen. generally 40 fps in medium settings without rtx on 1440p. not great performance, but i'm happy. just finished the game in around 35 hours, in two weeks. hasn't happened in a while. i'm more than impressed with many aspects of the game. the 'cinematic' quality is enormous, characters come across three dimensional and the dialogue is great. little things, like the ability to take a sip of a drink within a dialogue sequence, add enormously to the atmosphere. the sound quality, the environments, everything is very thematic and beautifully crafted. however, yes, the game does fail on some fronts that it tries to conquer. the physics system is crazy  crash with a motorcycle and you might fly a couple hundred meters into the air. driving feels rather clunky. crowd ai could've been done a lot better. opponent ai could've been done a lot better. the 'turn around and people dissapear from the streets' could've been done a lot better. however, if, like me, you want an action packed dense 3040 hour experience and not longer with a great story and place to discover, night city is just a great and awesome backdrop. to me, comparing gta v to cyberpunk 2077 is crazy  yes, i sometimes enjoyed the driving in gta, but i've never played a gta where i was actually impressed with the story. i played cyberpunk 2077 because i was impressed with the story, characters, themes and atmosphere of the witcher, and i wasn't dissapointed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"excluding all of the bugs, glitches and nonexistent optimization, game is still pretty cool and enjoyable.there are a problems, but they dont spoiling these impressions and gaming experience at all.this game could pretend to be a masterpiece ,but unfortunately its raw.hope performance issues will be fixed"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i went through this game completely twice, having played 110 hours in 10 days. in my opinion, this is one of the best games of the decade, i understand people's anger at glitches and optimization on the ps4 and xbox one, but don't blame the development team, blame the investors and directors of cdpr. i went through the game on a macbook pro 16 on medium settings and through gfn, in both versions i had a lot of fun. if you are not a person who will look for all the glitches and problems, and will enjoy the game, buy and play, but my advice is to wait half a year or at least a couple of months. all the best."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"well i just finished the game and i can say i really enjoyed the game. i did run into a few graphics bugs and and the performance was a bit bad i don't have a great rig so that also plays a role but apart from that the stories were really amazing. i did most of the side quests in the game before completing it and i can say the characters are realllyyy well written. i remembered every one of them by name after just one interaction. there should have been a bit more weight to your choices and a bit more choices at that but its okay as it is i cant wait for the dlc and my next playthrough. i'm not even gonna mention the music since that was exceptional in every way shape and form. they keep nailing this and i'm glad they do. the gameplay was okay nothing too special but i expected something like this since its not an action game after all, better than elder scrolls and fallout games but i love those so this was no problem, but i must say i enjoyed the combat a lot more in the witcher 3. if bugs really annoy you wait a few months so they fix most of the  the the broken ass cops, they are the worst wish i could just disable them but if it doesn't bother you go for it its a very solid game overshadowed by the bad launch and bad management i presume they focused on useless details before finishing core aspects of the game itself. hope it helped. also forgot to say one thing, panammmm"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"what i didn't like many bugs the worst in this game is because of the rpg riding  could be better shooting  could be better wasteland is truly dead the world doesn't react to you in any way 30 fps on recommended hardware many mechanics, work on which has been started but not finished a huge variety of similar missions  buying a car in the same category with good additional missions. what i liked overall visual style character design open world design atmosphere nice music plot highquality and welldesigned cut scenes there are interesting additional missions outcome i really like the game because of the visual, i'm in love, but it's just not possible to close my eyes to some things"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"the best game in a last few years that i have played. then why not 1010?  1. there should be more content except main story, more quest related to gangs and life in the city, all side quest are related to romance options and boxing challenges. there are contracts but they dont have valuable story. 2. ai of npc is bad. its similar to npc in mmo games. 3. dont have random events and forced conversations. you can interact with other only when you want to do it and they cant do it by their own except by phone. there should be at least sometimes a thug that will come to you and try to rob you on a street or someone that will talk to you by them own. night city supposed to be really dangerous place but you can avoid danger just by no getting too close because no one will come to you by themselves. 4.cops are like someone programed them in 2 days. they just spawn out of nowhere, they dont drive cars and chase you. they are behaving the same way like any other gang members or npc that can be aggressive. i didnt have any performance issues probably because i have really good pc and played on ultra settings. few minor glitches , really few like maybe 6 in 80h of playing that didnt do not affected the game, and can be patched. i wish the main story ware a little longer or there ware a lot other side quests. still worth playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"well since the last update some bugs got fixed and now, i can play the game in ultra settings. which is honestly pretty nice. i think the story is one of the best ever written. i am not a professional critic. i am a normal gamer and for what i pay i get something really good. i personally dont mind bugs and stuff like that. if you really care about bugs, this game is definitely nothing for you!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"on pc the game is faulty, it has some bugs, the ai is terrrible, there's lack of rpg elements 's not what it's promised, for sure, i hope they'll fix everything, the company have a good record and the game will be preped for multiplayer in the incoming years, they'll surely work a lot on it. now, letting that aside, the game is amazing in many aspects, i mean, performance, it has state of the art graphics and runs better than other aaa games that i own and seems less demanding, this game loads an entire city full of people, not just your typical plain field with some rocks and trees. and it have fast loading time, with no loading screens once inside the game. the main story is also incredible, and sidequest full of details. the ost is just wonderful. the details they put in so many things, every main character have a personallity, you can fell ticks in their body when things are happening. the detail of the cars and weapons are unbeliable. i tell you, patch some bugs, give a decent ai and add a few rpg elements, and it will be 1110. and i'm also hopeful about the mod community, there's so much content that could be expanded to make it even better...."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"the main issue is the hype. cyberpunk is not particularly bad, it's just not what was promised. i have more 120 hours in it and i am enjoying it. but as you said, there are many problems and bugs. but hey, if watch dogs 2 has 7.6 from players than 7.1 for cyberpunk is still low. in my opinion, if there wasn't the exaggerated hype, there wouldn't be so high pressure to publish it, there wouldn't be so many people talking about these problems and people would just care less about them bucause sometime it's just nitpicking. the question is, where did this hype came from? i think the problem lies on both sides, people did imagine another masterpiece, after witcher 3, and the studio did nothing to stop it, if not put another log in that fire. but the truth is, no one can do only masterpieces. the cyberpunk, while still a good game, is not another masterpiece. but hey, there is still hope. after what happened with no man's sky, i believe to anything. for me, cyberpunk is a solid 7.510, if cdpr will have the will to repair the game and will do so successfully, i am willing to go even higher. and it is possible, they showed good user support earlier with the witcher 3 i unfortunately did not played the 1 and 2 when they came out, so i can't speak for those. and yes, i'm fortunately playing on pc, but hope they fix the game on consoles asap. those 7.510 were for the pc version. i may have missed something or whatever, so feel free to correct me"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i went into the game expecting a lot. as a big fan of the deus ex series, i was constantly being told by other people that this game would not scratch my deus ex itch. however, because of these expectations, i was utterly and pleasantly surprised by the game i got. it not only scratching 90 of that itch besides the difference in story focus and tone it exceeded deus ex in a multitude of ways. this is the most dense, detailed open world ever created, at a scale that parallels other open world games, but with multiple times more love and attention put into world design and actual execution. the combat gameplay is amazing, rpg elements are overwhelming it's a good thing and the story is brilliant. reviews are pouring in from people who are having a bad time experiencing the game, and thus have not been able to play it properly. but this is an objective review from somebody who is fortunately able to play the game. i have an rtx 3080 on my pc and so the game runs as good as i can expect a game this graphically ambitious to. i believe as the years go by, and everyone is able to enjoy this masterpiece at it's best, it will be remembered as a tipping point for game expectations. let's not forget, as players reviewing a game, we're not comparing cd projekt red with the expectations gamers and they have for themselves. we're comparing their game to the state of gaming."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"roughly 50 hours in. my honest opinion is if cyberpunk 2077 was some sort of get in the car, only to listen to the radio simulation, i'd still pay 60 dollars."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,goty after the bugs are fixed. cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece that will be looked back as the same way deus ex 1 is hailed as one of the best rpgs of all time.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"sure they overhyped and overmarketed the game. this game is definitely not for everyone. this is targeted more toward pc gamers and original deus ex fans. i can see this game being far too weird, complex, and ambitious to most gamers on the market. the key bindings, controls, and ui's clearly show it's targeted platform being pc. i would not have a fun time playing this with a controller, the amount of menus i can just imagine being annoying to the point of just not worth playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"this game has flaws in the form of poorly worked out mechanics of cars, various bugs, but give this game a chance. yes, it was released too early, let's hope that in the future the developers will fix all their mistakes and implement ideas that have not yet been implemented. if you look at this game now, then, despite all its bugs, the main plot and a considerable number of additional tasks in it are interesting. and most importantly, this game deals with important topics, without embellishment and excessive pathos. think about the themes that the developers put into the game. many of today's games offer you  that doesn't make any sense, but in a beautiful wrapper, without bugs and other technical problems. so, bugs can be fixed, but no one can fix the ty plot. i believe that it is worth appreciating at least the efforts of all the people who took part in the development of this game and give them time to correct all their mistakes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"cyberpunk 2077 could've been a masterpiece, but... there is a lot of buts in with this game. the game is optimized like ark surival when it came out. even on the lowest settings on a good computer it's a disaster. don't get me wrong this game has a lot of good things in it. the story is solid af and a couple of side missions are written well, but that's it... the rest of the side missions are kill, steal or destroy, typical far cry, assasins creed type of shiet. the climate of this game is omg amazing, but it gets a little rusty with all those bugs and the texture loading, so it was hard for me to get invested in the world after a couple hours. the music is honestly the best thing about the game. the soundtrack is a blast, every song is a banger. okay that was the overall game, but what about the gameplay? the gunplay is meh.. i feel like playing fallout new vegas again but in a bad way. i found myself shooting the smart guns, beacause u don't even need to aim which is a fantastic thing. the hacking feels fresh at the start and kinda fun to use, but later it just feels like a side fun thing which leaks effectivness. i had more fun with that in watch dogs... don't even start with the skill tree. at the start it looks fcking amazing with a lot of options, then u start to feel like u are playing path of exile. overall opinion the hype killed the game honestly. i waited 7 years for this game i even bought the special edition, i was not on the hype train, i just wanted this game to be a solid 8..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"absolute trash. terrible 2 generationsold systems. this rubbish doesn't even compare to gta 5 back when it released on ps3! even on pc this fame feels like a dated game, aside from the pretty graphics. npcs absolutely , cops , all the promised features either terribly watered down or removed. wake up sheeple... you continue allowing game studios to get away with messes like this and we are all doomed. it's unfortunately a sales success which means they are getting away with the just release it and fix it later attitude. i got my refund... perhaps they will fix this mess but it's going to take more than just fixing the thousands of bugs and glitches. the entire games systems and features need overhauls in order to make this game feel even close to next gen... it brings nothing new to the table that you can't experience elsewhere even better than this. greatest let down in the history of gaming! shame it has such a delusioned, cultlike, followingfanbase that scoop up any pile of poop cdpr pushes out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"this is my favorite game ever, even with the visual bugs, even with other little bugs. the story, world, mechanics are exceptional. i look forward to the dlc and to bug fixes and more content to flush out this amazing world. anyone who has issues this game is worth the wait, the story is moving, the world vast and fully explorable. the setting, crafting system, everything is there. once this game gets so much patches ala witcher 3 this is going to be a must play masterpiece for folks who don't even like the cyberpunk genre but just want a gta alternative. i can't wait until there are rp servers to be able to rp in night city like we can rp in los santos"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"never in my life i've enjoyed triple a game this much. the plot is great, the architecture is extraordinary, npcs are vibrant and unique, even shooting isn't bad for a rpg game. i've quite enjoyed fighting with one of the main bosses this much, that i've decided to quickload and fight with him again, just to increase the fun by using more close combat style   few moments of it were literally  epic. i'm also enjoying the simple car rides through the night city at night, both as driver and passenger. the flashing neons, the music, vibrant and living ambient and ever changing landscapes, architecture and colors  add good plot and narration to it and you've just got something awesome. and now, for the bad part. crafting is meh. not good, not bad, just meh. playing with a xbox 360 controller is a pain when it comes to action. which is a shame, considering having the ability to moverun fluidly. which isn't possible with a keyboard  aim assist doesn't work for me  it may be due to how old it is, but it's just bad nonetheless. character creator  at first looked very nice and detailed, but after closer inspection.. well, it's quite basic. but maybe i'm exaggerating due to my experience with eve online's creator  driving model isn't too great too, especially when it comes to firstperson view from the car. the fov could be little bigger imo. also the minimap is just useless  most of the time, you have no idea when you will have to turn  it would be much better if it zoomed out a little depending on speed?. motorcycle drifts  i just hate it when i try to drift into a turn, and just at the end of a drift, my motorcycle rotates and straightens up for no reason, causing me to crash. and the vehicles are waay too jumpy imho. and last but not least, the bugs. of course, there are many of them, but quite a few triple a games also have them. there are many, at first i had problems due to avx bug, but most of the time, the game plays just fine, even on not too fresh hardware hardware. few bugs are annoying, few can ruin the ambient, but they are so insignificant for me, that i mostly just ignore them. mostly i just laugh, and laugh is healthy, so winwin i guess. to conclude it's a great game with many innovations. it makes me laugh, it makes me sad, it makes me angry or happy. the movielike atmosphere is just great. and bugs, at least on a midgood pc, are bearable. let's just hope that cdpr will give it a final polish badum tsss soon enough"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"this game is  aside the bad technical state  a boring, open world rpg shooter. has nothing to offer except of some interesting cyberpunkelements."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,this game will age like wine could have been a 10 if not for the bugs and a few missing features. remarkable experience. extremely recommend

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"cyberpunk 2077 review positives compelling characters great combat system story for the most part, the game looks beautiful soundtrack driving feels really good tons of side quests night city is a unique open world... negatives ...which unfortunately feels empty lots of bugs stealth does not worth the time the hype around cyberpunk 2077 was so big, that it was unachievable. still cd projekt red made a game that will be remembered forever. it is not perfect by any means but personally, i had a blast playing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"amazing game, amazing graphics, amazing story, endless opportunities ind perks and skills! so many opportunities for how you wanna play and which paths you choose. incredibly optimized regarding to graphics vs performance on pc and ray tracing is incredible. love that you included dlss 2.0, otherwise it would have been way different, when you try playing in max settings with raytracing in 1440p. yes there are minor issues here and there, but nothing serious on pc and we all asked for it to be released even though they several times tried to tell us it wasn't ready. yes ofc it shouldn't have been released for last gen consoles at all, or just not yet. stop crying, pretend the game has been delayed again and open it in march when it has been fixed with patches. problem solved. or buy a pc. playing on rtx 2070, may upgrade to 3080 to play 4k at oled."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"perfect and massive game. complex, amazing open world, npc interactions, story. life choices matter! i do not experience any glitches or problems with play style so far act 2. works amazingly smooth on cpu amd 3600  gpu rx 5700 xt on maximum quality and details."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i find myself deeply conflicted trying to accurately rate this game. the things is that there's no way to deny all the things that are wrong with the games, which leads me to believe i must score it lower than 10. however, much like a family member, i love this game despite all its faults. however, i must warn some more active players. this is not a typical game! this plays much more like a movie or a book than a game. in cyberpunk 2077 you get to experience the world through the eyes of v much more than you get to play god as you would in may rpgs. i know how it sounds... but honestly. i cannot remember a single game in history that can top cp77 in terms of story immersion graphics memorable moments architecture facial expression voice acting never before have a game world captivated me so much that i genuinely miss spending time with a bunch of lines of codes, the characters and the moments they bring are simply cutting edge. that said, there are a bunch of things the game does so bad as well thousands of bugsglitches, both quest breaking and immersion breaking at times horrible lootingclothing system. why on earth go for a washed down wow type loot system? awful decision. makes the loot feel totally forgettable and redundant. every new item is just another number, its rarity or type doesn't matter, only the dpsarmor awful driving mechanics highly questionable skill trees and powerprogression, feels both underworked and underwhelming way too arbitrary cybernetics, many of which are just another cheap perk. double jump was one the few ones that actually felt like a real cybernetic upgrade.. but even that one should have displayed new legs to reflect the change in bio. so.... all said and done. it has many flaws, but despite those it delivers such a heart warming and breaking experience that i will never forget it. thank you cpr for the best gaming experience in my life."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,after 10 h of playng i got no crush at all but some minor glitches. the city is vibrant and full of life and i'm not experieng anyone of the issues described by others. maybe you shoudn't buy the game on a potato computer? i'm playin on an alienwarw i17 of 2017 and it run smmothy on hight resolutiom. the story is captching untill now and you can end any quest using differents tactics.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"aything can be said, but the only thing i'm sure is that this thing you prepared is not an rpg game. perfect universe, awful game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"good story, great scenes, breathtaking world filling and design. but stupid mobs that spoil the sensation of good shooting. offbalance hacking. a nonworking open world ambition is good, but a hub location would be more suitable for the game, imho. nice summer blockbuster. but not the game we've been waiting for so long. i love this game, but there are too many moments that are implemented at the rudimentary level."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"some six hours into the game i just felt i needed to quit. it was not the omnipresent bugs, it just didn't reach the excitement i would expect from such a title. the story is ok, but too much meaningless dialogue meaning makes it dull. battle mechanics is not thrilling enough to give you the itch. the environment, although masterfully crafted gets monotonous. it's a very ambitious game, i would say overambitious, but lacks some real edge."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"the game is great. wouldn't call it the best game i ever played but it's definitely one of them. an engaging story with colorful characters, romance options that have some depth to them unlike many other rpgs, nice gameplay, fantastic worldbuilding, amazing and i mean amazing side quests, and many many more. to be fair i was a bit afraid that the amount of mechanics would be overwhelming but one can get a hang of it pretty quickly. and when it comes to bugs i didn't really get any noteworthy ones. the most i remember that has to do with them is a chuckle or two i got out of some fun visual bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i forgave cyberpunk 2077 a lot 40fps, blurry image, monotonous sweeps, stupid artificial intelligence, small bugs, but cdpr's request not to collect or create inventory, for the sake of a stable game, put an end to my patience. interesting characters and plot no longer save the game. extremely crude project."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"it's a great game full of content with intriguing story which is exactly what i demand from a game. to compare it with the witcher 3, it's not as good but still a 10. now, the bad things. technical state of the game is appalling. bad optimization, glitches and bugs, which they will all be hopefully fixed in some given time. if you have strong enough pc and you can overlook a few glitches here and there you will enjoy this game no mather how will you approach it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"is it perfect and without issues at release? no. for me my experience hasn't been marred. that being said i did have to reload a save couple of times because the the bodies glitched so i could not loot them for the quest. i don't understand why people are hard on this game when games like skyrim even the top reviewed games. i'm only a consumer who the game targeted so i suppose the journos must be the arbiters of what we should like in their view? yeah right. the combat take some getting used to and is somewhat involved and can get frustrating but it's solid. i love this game! there is a caveat for me though because after a decent amount of time you will notice its not the rpg cdpr promised which i find somewhat dishonest. the choices have minimal impact on the story and in its current state i'm a little disappointed, especially since the open world quests and the better side quests stop cold turkey up to a point at the end of the game and game breaking technical issues. its still an 810 but cdpr does not get a free pass from me. play it when the game is in a better state unless you feel you really need to play it now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i really tried to like this game but i'm afraid i just cannot find any further enjoyments after spent 50 hours in it. i won't address bugs and glitches because at this point it's a widely known issue. the problems with cyberpunk 2077 is beyond program faulty. my two main disappointments are broken ai and the lack of side activities. the ai is broken or even worse it's simply nonexistent, the npcs are mostly scripted lifeless husks with zero situational awareness. they exist solely for population density, a background character not inhabitant of night city. the side activities are very bare bones a couple of things you can do are gigs side quest, fighting arenas, a few standard shops and vendors to interact with. the side quest are presented to you and as a result it rips the sense of exploration and oftentimes feel very overwhelming. additionally there are no mini games, vehicle customizations, or even parlor to change your appearance. in sums there are no real life activities in the game. a few things that also bothering me are the life paths. it has no impact on your story except for the very first 20 minutes. i personally don't like the looter shooter mechanism it's shallow and stressful at the same times. i felt pressured to look and check every weapons and component. the ability to craft legendary items locked behind certain end game perks, where you have already powerful enough with epictier weapon. the enemies are bullet sponges and thus makes stealth pretty much useless in highlevel area. lastly the acting, i thinks keanu reeves is a fantastic actor but i personally think he isn't the right choices for silverhand. his acting is a little stiff and definitely doesn't do justice for silverhand wild persona. now onto the good things. the main story is good but i cannot say the same for sidequest some are interesting but some are just you being another errand boy. the voice acting and music are fantastic. the aesthetics and graphics are visually stunning if you have highend pc this game rely a lots to rtx, for medium end pc the graphics is comparable to others modern open world rpg like gta and watch dogs. final verdict. beyond bugs and glitches cyberpunk 2077 suffers from identity crisis it tries to touch a lot of things and failed to be excel or even meet the minimum standard of everything it touches. one thing that this game certainly revolutionizes is the marketing and pr. this game isn't worth buying in this current state just wait another year until the bugs and glitches, and more gameplay mechanism fixed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"first off all, i want to say thank you to cdpr for this wonderful game. you are dreamers, just like the main character of the game. and you also don't get everything right the first time. even despite the bugs, you can still see the love for what you do. don't stop, please. incredibly detailed surrounding world, really exciting story. the game is really mature, and not only because it has nudity, which is undoubtedly cool! but it also addresses important issues that we may face in the future"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"1010 loved it! imo the characters and storyline are 100 worth getting the game for, and i've had a lot of fun playing it. would definitely recommend. i think if they'd given it another year or even half a year of development the launch would have gone more smoothly but here we are. i still enjoyed it, and i'm playing on base ps4. will be looking forward to future dlc for this one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"despite the bugs, the fascinating plot and details, and the high sense of substitution, i like this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i like that you can solve every quest on few ways. you can sneak on top of building and get inside or turn off cameras and kill everyone. you can wait and see what is going on, and then find second entrance or use a virus and overpower whole gang. every quest is a little different. i must say skippy made may day. bugs sometimes you cannot interact with important item or someone does not call after 1 day. usually reloading helps in this case. i also had 1 case of falling behind textures in 90h playtime."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i didnt watch any trailers or gameplay footage during the announcenment and build up to this game release so that i could go in blind knowing only that it was made my the makers of the witcher 3, one of my favourite and most played games. i think that was a good move as a lot of people are disappointed it didnt live up to the trailers. answer me this, when did a game last live up to the expectations set by the trailers?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,best game since tes skyrim. i think its better than witcher 3. release bugs are normal but not too much or gamebraking. played 70h on playstaion 5.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"i play this game on pc in medium settings without crashes . the game is very playful. incredibly complex story,although not my punk vibe. i heartily recommend cyberpunk 2077"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"great graphics and gameplay. i love the futuristic campaign, unbelievably gripping and exciting!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"before you read i run the game on pc with ultra settings. despite having some minor bugs and glitches, the imo only average gunplay and the partially weird driving behavior of the vehicles  i simply loved cyberpunk. the story is intense and contains multiple endings, the characters are amazing especially johnny silverhand and the quest design is outstanding. even the side missions are interesting and funny. in the end, all the pros made me forget cyberpunk's weaknesses. i hope console players can enjoy this beatiful soon as well."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,"before i say anything if you bought this game on lastgen consoles and expecting it to run. you're most likely a inbred that thinks that last of us 2 is a masterpiece. if you don't want the game refund it  cd project red are literally making ever way for you refund if you didn't enjoy it. in my head it's like you guys want gta v on your ps2 when it's suppose to be release on ps3 and xbox 360. the game has issues sure. but there's so much that's going into game. great characters, different atmosphere, so much detail,  ton of side quests, fanatic story, and so much more. the bug will be worked out knowing cd project red. they really care about their games. and lowkey it's your fault for rushing them. if there was a little more time they would have before released the product would have came out better. in the words of shigeru miyamoto a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-23,so unbelievably disappointing on ps4 pro. what a shame. we had waited for so long. cdp red should have waited until it was actually ready to release it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,originally gave this game a bad review but after 40 hours play i've changed my mind. this game is solid gold even with the bugs. when the bugs are fixed it will be solid platinum. give it a chance before you jump on the dumpster wagon.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i guess the story is just too good to give it anything below 9. i don't care about the visual bugs, the story is the most important thing for me. panam quests were wonderful. it's still a must play in my opinion."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"to my mind this is the most immersive, next gen game i've played to date. yes, there are bugs and release pains but those are being patched. the gameplay is phenomenal, so many ways to customize your toon, the enemies play smart giving each encounter a rewarding challenge. can't recommend it enough."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"first let's not be a fanboy and make an objective review. the ai is pure crap. they don't know what to do in traffic. polices are spawning so close to you and when you enter car you are unbreakable. bugs are gamebreaking and even ubisoft does make it better. there are not so much rpg mechanics. the choices only effect first 15 minute and last 15 minute of the game. story is average. same thing happens when you play try to get a, meet with someone, try to get b for her, repeat. good thing is sometimes missions are well."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"buggy but great. i spent 60 hour playing this game and still not even close to the end. definitely this product is not perfect and developers should spend much more time to fix bugs before release. but... it's still one of the best games i have ever played  simply like that. i don't care if there is a graphics glitch as long as there is a great story, climate, vision of future world based on technology, with it's own dilemmas."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i finished the game, after 57h. graphics mediocre, sound stunning, music good, story more than good. it is not rpg! i do not like any of endings. stupid endings."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"yes, i agree the game has bugs and glitches which some are game breaking and i do not condone the release  in an unfinished state. however voiceacting, musicradio, story driven though actions are above the level of any rpg relessed to date. i truly believe this game will hold it's candle test through the pass of time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the game, like any new release, has its share of bugs and glitches. but, quite frankly they're no worse than any other major title to hit the market in recent memory. i'm playing it on what most would call a modest pc at best with minimal issues. the game at its core is beautiful, detailed, and feels alive and the story and side quests are all engaging and well designed. its exactly what you would expect from cdpr. so many of these negative reviews seem to stem from the current need to bash anything that gets hyped though i'll concur this game should never have been released for the ps4 and xbox one and should have been released only on pc and nextgen consoles trying to cover all the bases was a recipe for disaster. if this was another rushedrelease, money grab from a major company i would understand. cdpr has been one of the few companies these days that genuinely seems to care about delivering a quality products. if you need more proof... how many companies would offer refunds for dissatisfied players in 2020? bottom line if you plan to play it on a pc as it was intended or a nextgen console i highly recommend giving it a shot."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game is a high budget interactive movie, and is a masterpiece at that, with difficult choices to make, outcomes to reflect on, countless references to philosophy and literature and many characters to make the laissezfaire city of the future feel alive and real. comparing it with gta is as correct as comparing altered carbon with bojack horseman the comedy. combat gameplay is unpolished and player power gets out of control really quickly, but that is to be expected in firstperson realtime rpg where stealth, melee and ranged builds are designed to be equally viable in any given fight, especially given the fact that story missions do not require open world xp grind to be completed enemy scaling is not implemented. it is still fun to roleplay though. there are currently plenty of glitches, but most of them are hilarious rather than annoying. annoying things mostly concern vehicles. i cannot say for console users and their troubles, but i sincerely hope there will be more games which attempt to combine huge gameplay scope with narrative depth in the future, and therefore feel the need to support the developers in these difficult times with a rating."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i created an account just to write a review as i saw reviewers slandering this title unjustly it is true, in his original release version the game is full of bug and glitches but... what a  masterpiece they have conceived! i have rarely seen something so complete the gameplay, the captivating storyline, the rpg elements, the attention to detail, the soundtrack which is just so well done, even real and famous actors like keanu reeves giving their participation and hence helping to draw non playable characters who are just so interesting to talk to... .... this game is simply put the draft of a real masterpiece which sadly was released from their creators while still effectively in draft state. still i am awarding 1010 because of all the amount of work that was visibly put into it just give the company some time and after bugs and glitches shall be fixed, come and buy this game and you will see why i am awarding 1010."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"wonderful plot, charismatic characters, amazing atmosphere. there are problems with bugs, like any other game on release, but i'm sure they will be fixed. thanks to the cdpr for the excellent presentation of the characters as they could be in real life without an obsessive political agenda, which has already become too much an eyesore for adequate gamers. my ratings 1. story  10 2. characters  10 3. world  10 4. visual  10 5. technical issues  5 there is bugs on release"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,good  graphics with rtx on is fine. however you need at least rtx3090 to play it in ultra 4k.  story is fine. bad  i personally lack of 3rd person view. i like to see my avatar.  clothes are seems to be random and in the end you're looking more like clown choosing clothes with best stats. i'd rather go with witcherlike sets.  rpg system is bad. perks and skills are boring x modifiers.  physicsengine is not good for gtalike open world game. it was probably fine for riding a horse trough some forest in witcher games but not for carsbikes.  stealth is boring  shooting doesn't feel right  side missions feel repetitive.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"bland story, broken ai, poor combat, orvall unfinished buggy with it being far to easy to soft lock your character just doing normal stuff during your playthrough game you'll be driving and you call will hit a invisible curb and flip or you'll be jump across a fence and get flung a hundred feet and some time you just die for not reason your health just drops to 0 this game will be good eventually but right now it just a mess."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i can agree that the game doesn't feel fininshed. there are animation and texture glitches around basically every corner. in other games you would usually look at a glitch and be like huh, guess that happened but in this game it just becomes a usual thing. the story makes up for that 100 though in my opinion. i have never felt the same compassion towards the characters in this game in any other game. you actually feel lika you live there instead of just showing up and killing some people"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"amazing game. missing the 10 mark because some bugs really throw you out of the immersion this game can give you. play it on pc, i only had a couple a hard crashes, but expect glitches for now. might be worth a 10 once the game is patched."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"despite the backlash, this is the most fun ive had in a game for a while. now, after 90 hours on my first playthrough, i can confidently say that this game is an extremely strong 9. bugs aside, the only element that prevents this from being a 10 is the npc ai and lack of non quest activities to do. the writing is so strong and the romance is handled well, but it wouldve blown me away if you were able to just chill at a bar or restaurant without having to buy the items, have them appear in your inventory, and eat. i would love to be able to give my girlguy a call and just see a movie. and, yes, i know this isnt gta 4 or sa, nor is it the sims, but the world is so gorgeously crafted and we are also able to interact with the world in quests, so these roleplaying elements shouldve been easy enough to implement. i cant wait to see what the dlcs, expansions, etc will add to this game. the ultimate or goty edition may very will be a 10. for now, i highly recommend this"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"amazing cyberpunk atmosphere, a lot of easter eggs, nice story, few different endings. spend in game more than 70 hours going to continue playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"realy awesome game! i played more then 80 hours and its just a side quiest  it's so original, cool and inderesting little stories. graphics are realy awesome! it's a realy next gen! i was not see many bags on pc. and baggs not a critical  some of that was be funny and i remember witcher 3 in 2015 and it's had baggs like in this game. not problem. i playd right after game was released at 10dec and it work very nice. no one crash. no one crytical baggs. and cyberpunk 2077 realy awesome game. i definitely will play that on and on even after finished that. 100 replayeble. applause for cdpr. i can't wait a big dlc!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"great game, i would consider it to be the same caliber as gta 5, rdr2 and almost the same as witcher 3. rated 9 as the story was too short and the choices in the game weren't impactful on the story as other aaa modern rpgs."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the games phenomenal. one of the most immersive games i've played in a really long time. exploring the city is mind blowing the amount of detail in the city is mind blowing, the side quests are amazing, love the amount of customization i can add to my character build. its a fantastic game and its a shame its plagued with so many bugs and glitches the sooner they update the fame and polish it the sooner it'll be recognized as something amazing and i hope all these issues get fixed in this amazing game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"it was meant to be a next gen open world. oh boy... a lot of people already listed everything missing or not working in the game, i wont do it again. instead i will assume that i played the game in a closed prealpha testing event. i assume like this was a proof of concept that cdpr sent me and asked hey, this is the new game we are currently working on. there are still years of work to be done but just tell us how you feel about the concept.. so here is how my feedback to cdpr would be like. first of all, content density is good guys, great work on that. but the game engine doesn't work at all. physics are broken all around, i think you have to make a physic engine overhaul before the alpha release. i see that you haven't implemented any kind of ai yet, i would like to see how game will look like after ai is added. also i understand you haven't started with the bug fixing yet but i can say you are going to have a tough time with it. weapons  cars look fine right now but you definitely need to add more variants. i thought this was supposed to be a nextgen open world, but i didn't see anything new. maybe once ai is added, it feels different but as of now open world experience is so shallow. i would suggest adding some more interactions with the world and remove the markers from the map so players can explore themselves. i must say that gunfight mechanics are awful as they are now, please tell me this is just a place holder and you haven't implemented the real one yet. it is even worse than 23 years old halflife. add dynamic stuff to gunfights, stand and shoot is so boring. also this is a futuristic game, please add some futuristic gun mechanics other than hold and release. double tap dodges are also terrible, overall all instant movements are terrible, smoothen them a bit. if i am walking on a not flat surface, my camera keeps going up and down instantly. as this is a prealpha proof of concept with tons of unfinished stuff and bugs, i didn't really enjoy the games atmosphere. in sunset i look to the landscape and say what a good view, then i see my own shadow, like a puppet, lol. it looks so funny, maybe you can release the game with this shadow to make people lose their minds p. overall i think this project has a great potential, but also so much work is required. i really can't wait years to see how the completed version will look like. great job guys, keep it up! back to reality, i am really surprised after 5 years of full time development, this is what they come up with. many people rate it higher because they believe it will be fixed soon! but as it is released as a complete and finished game, i will rate it as one. 8 points for the content, 6 points for either not working or not implemented mechanics. 210, terrible."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i was never part of the hype for this game but i will admit, i was excited to play it day one. i launch up the game and within the first 10 minutes, i see trees appearing through walls. my computer can run this game at high graphics with no frame issues and yet the amount of graphical bugs is insane. i see many people saying the story and characters are amazing. really? one of the first things you see in the game, choosing your backstory, has so little impact on the story, you might as well choose one at random. i haven't beaten the story yet, so i will not talk about it too much but so far, with 15 hours into the game, it's nothing special. combat can be fun but gets repetitive after a while for me. hacking was a let down as i lacked ram to do anything anyway and i found no reason to bother distracting enemies as i can just kill them in the time it takes to hack. the city has a great visual atmosphere but it feels so lifeless in terms of the npcs. most just stay in one place and have one line of dialogue that might not even make sense in the situation. police have practically zero impact as you can escape them by jogging down the street. the next topic is quests. i will say, some of the quests are pretty interesting but many lack a good reward to make me want to do them. also, some quests are basically impossible to beat unless you are a certain level but are given to you at the start of the game, like the fight club quests. one of the fights will take all your health in one punch while you will do 1 damage. i could go into a lot more but that would take a 500 page book. anyone giving this pos more than a 7 is lying to themselves as a result of blind loyalty to cdpr. i wish i could refund"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"played it on xbox one x and didn't faces any really blocking issues. understand that my experience may be different from other people. really liked the game, especially deep and thoughts provoking story with different endings. if you have machine to run it  must play this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"everything about this game is barely adequate. except for the shallow openworld, braindead npcs, lack of wanted system, and police car chases. the story is barely passable and your choices hardly affect the outcome of most situations. the art style is more far cry new dawn than the rpg of the dark future, the rpg mechanics are incredibly light, and the cyberware enhancements are lame in comparison to deus ex human revolution."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i might play on god tier gear 3080, i9 etc it might have some bugs and so on. but its not any worse then so many other ruff around the edges games that are still beloved games. notor, fallout nv, oblivion etc. and the game is a labor of love and the gameplay is quite fun. i mean its not the cure for covid19 but its pretty cool. think gta mixed with fallout mixed with dishonored."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this is a game that i love a lot yet hurts my soul. it's a masterpiece! well... almost... essentially, this is a great and broken game. lots of fun, variety of weapons, a beautiful modern city, crowded streets, nice cars, fun combat, hacking, stealth, and rpg elements. good stuff! characters are all likable and memorable. really, even the minor ones have personality and they are well written. the whole thing is immersive. no third person cut scenes, you can look around anytime, the game almost never takes the control away from you. it's all from your perspective and it works so well! others should learn from this or halflife when it comes to cutscenes. story is cool, lots of side missions, some choices that affects other things but it's not going that deep. voice actors are all great. music is fantastic, both background music and most of the ones from the radio too though many of them are not my taste. vehicle physics are ok, nothing special there, could be better for sure. and it's hard to see out of first person view from car. wish you could place the camera higher. first person animations are all great and immersive. combat is fun, though enemies can be bullet spongy. rpg elements are cool, though it's a bit on the lighter side. unlocking perks are great and most of them are really useful. i'll definitely play through the game with multiple character setup. visually the game is really impressive. such a beautifully crafted, believable world! is it? well, the streets are truly crowded but npcs are kinda dumb and i wish the would do more. same is true about enemy ai... not so clever. they are challenging yes, but not exactly because they are doing impressive tactics or they are always good at taking cover. sometimes they just take the shoots and well, not really doing against it. hacking is useful, along with stealth it's really fun to find a way to silently take out the bad guys. shooting feels fine too. hmmm so... believable world? well sometimes yes! but sadly any versions of cyberpunk 2077 is full of glitches, the pc version too. sadly. it has really weird, physics related bugs, sometimes missions can't be properly finished. enemies appear inside walls. cars sink into the ground. few minor visual problems here and there. dumb ai. tposing characters. long, long list of crap. yet i love the game! it's really an unpolished masterpiece. or maybe i should say, wasted potential? it was some extremely strong points, some broken promises and lack of polishing. if they could have work on it for 6 more months, maybe we could have got the game they promised to us... i'm really conflicted. sometimes i would give it a 6 sometimes a 9... hehehe... it was way too many great moments i can't overlook. same with the issues. i can play the game for hours in one sitting and i enjoy the whole thing... and sometimes i feel disappointed because of all the issues i meet... hype was way too much and even if the game is pretty damn good, the broken promises and oldgen console issues really destroyed cdpr's reputation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game goes on list with the best games ive ever played, creating the perfect story with perfect characters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"a technological marvel, with the best looking city ever created, amazing ray tracing effects and a fantastic soundtrack. but in terms of storytelling and immersion a complete bust. the city looks great, but is empty and most things cannot be interacted with. many functions that were shown in the trailers were cut from the game and the game feels hollow. the traffic is on rails, the promised subway was cut, there is no meaningful interaction with random npcs and so on.... the mainstory falls completely off the rails during midgame. for an rpg the story is very linear with almost no meaningful choices or interesting branches. at the end of the game the player can only decide which way he wants to die a as disabled person, with a 6 months life expectancy b as digital copy, reuploaded into your brain wiped body, also with a 6 months life expectancy c as digital copy, going into cyberspace and leaving your body to the terrorist johnny silverhand d as digital copy, owned by the arasaka megacorp, who are the villains what a disappointment, after all that hype..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"first is first, witcher 3 is my all time favorite game ever. this game however is nothing like what they advertised, and it's absurd. literally was all a lie. all bugs aside the game is a diamond covered in mountains of  it's a dead lifeless beautiful world. anyone that says this game is good either  1. believes that cdpr will somehow add all the functionality they promised literally 80 of the game is missing in terms of what was promised through ads and gameplay footage, which realistically won't happen unless they pull a no mans sky.  they literally cut out everything, and rushed this whole game. lifepaths, clothing effecting how people view you, customizing cars, changing how your character looks outside of the game start, using bd's outside of the 3 times you use it in the game, never even see your  once besides when you make the character at game start or if it glitches through your pants, only one female prostitute in the entire city, one romance choice for straight males, basic driving ai, basic npc ai, basic combat ai.... i can literally keep going. 1.5. that the broken functionality and missing content is somehow related to bugs! 2. played 12 hrs of the game, and stuck solely to the storyline. if you only do the story you can easily get tricked that this is a good game, but its literally all a facade. as soon as you realize none of your choices do anything, your life path doesn't mean  that all goes away after 15 mins of gameplay, or do anything but the main story line the illusion . its not an rpg like advertised, it's a liner story where you get to pick your ending. the choices you make are basically a strong yes b medium yes c weak yes d ask something random that does nothing. e say something stupid related to your lifepath that does absolutely nothing to the story insane how they said your lifepaths, and choices effect your game. maybe the first 15 mins of the game are unique to your lifepath, and after a montage that skips the introductions to literally everyone you work with in the game you then somehow become a street kid. leaving you confused as fk, who is this person calling me, what is this guy talking about, uh how am i friends with this person. i went from a powerful corpo employee, with corpo connects that talks like a business man to all of a sudden having zero corpo connects, talking with street kid slang, friends with random people i know nothing about, and wanting to burn the corpos to the ground. they 100 cut out about probably 40 of the game, and made it a stupid montage of you doing cool stuff, that they advertised in ads, but you never do. all the lifepaths after 15mins connect into the same montage that leads you to one linear street kid story. the only strong thing about this game is the visuals, and story. however, after playing for more than 10 mins you soon realize that it's a mirage. you can't interact with anything. there 100s of street vendors everywhere, you can only interact with about 1100. the ai is literally non existent. bump into a person and everyone literally runs screaming, and crouches down to no end. leave your car parked an inch off the curb, and all of night city is in a traffic jam. that's not a bug, that's an issue with the core ai functionality of this game. i gave this a 1 vs a 0 because damn keenu's character is the only good thing in this game, but that really fades away once you realize the story is linear, and not an rpg, but more of an action adventure game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the most breathtaking sciencefiction cyberpunk based game i've recently played. the story is great and while it's short and rushed, it has better pacing than many other stories. where the game disappointed me is the character development and the artificial intelligence, there are many interesting characters in this game, but only few of them have depth and develop throughout the story, as for the ai, it's very outdated. i played the game on a ps4 pro and i did encounter bugs, but i still enjoyed it, the gunplay feels satisfying, the world design is amazing, night city is one of the best looking cities in a videogame, but the repetitive gigs make the open world a little bit tedious. and lastly, the side quests are very interesting, there are some very immersive side quests that shocked me. this game is a bad rpg but a very good action adventure story game. despite the technical issues the game suffers from, this is some of cd projekt red's best work so far."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"sadly with all the bugs at launch the game was unplayable for some, and if i take those bugs into consideration is certainly lowers the score a loot, but when i finished the game after a few days, i realized how immersed i was, and sadly it does feel like some parts were rushed in the final act, but the ending i got made me so, emotional, so happy, and soo sad for finishing this great game. after all the bugs get patched, and when they add some free dlc im sure they will its cdpr, and after the expansions, the game will be a 910 for sure. but im lowering it to an 8 just because of some clearly cut content and of course bugs at launch..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"yes, maybe it is not completely ready, but still it was one hell of a adventure. there are bugs, but definitely you can see that this game was build by a talented folks with love what they are doing. you should not compare this game to the witcher, because it is completely different thing. i loved the atmosphere, the feeling of the night city good morning night city and same time sipping my morning coffee. so much good in this game and some things not so finished, but in the end, i enjoyed my time in night city and i think that i will visit night city again. for sure some of the tasks are rinse and repeat and was waiting that my actions would change more than ending, but this game leave me with a warm feeling. so much complaining, but in the end nothing else like this have been done before"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"on pc there are some minor bugs, but it is fairly compensated by the magnificent experience. best game since witcher for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"technically, this game isn't impressive, but this game has the writing to make up for it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,this could have been one of the best games ever made. but they lied... full of bugs and glithces and they won't even give me a refund.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"my score is a symbol of hope. hope that cdpr will survive and have a chance to make this game a masterpiece that it should be. it's a shame for me how things turn on and i'm very sad to understand what a huge fail is the start of cp77. the world in this game has a fantastic 1010 design, the music is impressive and the main storyline is phenomenal. but 80 of side quests and openworld activities are repetitive and boring grind elements for useless leveling. i don't even talk about optimization issues and bad rpg elements. it will be much better if the release was pushed to late 2021. i honestly fall in love with cyberpunk 2077 but i can't close my eyes to all collateral problems. i wish strength to cdpr developers and changes in topmanagement chairs. hope for a good goty edition in 2021 and brilliant cp online."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"if you had asked me a week ago this rating would be higher but, i just ran into the saved game bug wiping the progress that i had on my main save. and when i checked the forums i got a lazy fix and lecture on how i want to play the game is wrong and i should just start over. i think the game could be great. story is there, the games foundation is there. just wish i would have waited and not bought into the hype. hopefully this game sees a better state soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"si el juego no tuviera bugs sera un 9 o 10. el juego en pc es jugable y altamente recomendable, para m el mejor del ao, pero los bugs te sacan cada cierto tiempo de la historia y en ocasiones te obligan a repetir misiones. por este motivo parece ms una beta que un juego final. en cuanto consigan eliminar los fallos, ser una obra maestra para pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"un gioco davvero fantastico. ha i suoi bug del lancio, ma stanno esagerando troppo con le valutazioni negative. erano anni che non giocavo un gioco cos immenso e ben fatto e che mi spinga a rigiorcarlo ancora ed ancora per vedere tutte le alternative di dialogo e storie iniziali con i . spettacolare"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"cyberpunk 2077 is a 910 as well at it is a 510. the heart of this game, the narration, story and storylines, characters, music, night city itself are nothing short of brilliant, maybe the best in any video game to date. this game will immerse you in its world and you will not escape night city before you finish this game... if the map full of other mysteries and things to do doesn't keep you going. also, the city is gorgeous, every frame is a work of art from closeups on characters to the city landscape. but... this game is also a 510 because everything else ranges from good to really bad and broken. the gunplay and speed hack mechanics are pretty good though. but the progression system is kind of shallow, the hacking you'll see is bad, npcs ai is dumb, the police is nonexistent, driving is really inconsistent, the crafting system is broken into oblivion, there are so many bugs that it's not even funny and i'm sure there is more i forgot... so why 910? because even with all these problems i have had an awesome, unique, and almost magical experience. these problems aren't in most situations enough to damage the experience even a little. so if you're anything like me and you like these kinds of narrative experience think the witcher 3 for example this game is a mustplay but care night city will take all your time. if not, the game is not for you, go play something else  but to finish i will advise waiting for some patch to fix the bugs if cdpr survives its current crisis that is and hopefully the rest of the game because all cyberpunk problems can hopefully be patched with updates. this game has a lot of potentials, and with mods, patches, and extensions i'm convinced it will sit close to skyrim on the pantheon of openworld rpgs. but today it's just the unfinished version, a shadow of a brilliant maybe generationdefining game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the game is an amazing experience. the story is awesome, the music is great and the city is just beautiful i understand why people are frustrated, but i just really enjoyed it. i expected a great story and it met my expectation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"okay so up until now i have been defending cyberpunk and focusing more on the story and tried to ignore all the glitches and stuff but i just can't anymore. this game was first announced in may 2012. that's over 8 years, actually closer to 9 years... almost 9 years! okay, let's say it would be understandable if the game was in development for 3 years and people would be pressuring them to release the game and of course it would be buggy and unfinished. but almost 9 years! i don't even know where to start... the performance is absolutely awful, like i understand there is a lot of details but come on... i'm not running on the best pc, i am somewhere midrange, i5 7400, 16gb ddr4, and rx 560 4gb, i can still run a lot of mainstream titles on high settings and get good fps. but with cyberpunk i have to play it at low settings, 720p, and i'm barely hitting 3040 fps. that's insane. it's true that too much hype was going to be the downfall for this game because no game can live up to those expectations, but i did not expect to be this disappointed, mainly with performance and glitches and just overall an unpolished game. the game has a good story i will give it that, but the glitches and performance just distract you and it breaks the immersion. also, the way they lied about the performance on the lastgen consoles is so  dumb. like how the  is a normal ps4 going to run the game at 30 fps when a midrange pc can barely hit 30 at the lowest possible settings. holy  at first, i was defending and feeling bad for cdpr but they deserve what they are getting, they deserve the lawsuits. don't get me wrong i don't wish harm to the developers but to the people who are in charge. they deserve all the  they are getting. i really like the story, it has flaws, but let's be honest it's the only good thing that the game has as of right now. i am almost done with the story but it was partly ruined because of all the bugs and immersionbreaking glitches. personally, i will wait a few months for new patches and updates, maybe even a year, i just want to see the game for what it's supposed to be. and it's really a waste that it had to be like that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"no problem after 40hrs, everything is perfect  the story, gameplay, music, graphics, atmosphere..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game fully built on pc platforms only, not for console slaves! i guess who gives negative points, they are console gamers who here to sabotage. lol. i will drop only 1 point and it's about annoying control schematic. i believe they had to implant these controls schematic due to console controllers. brah, sick consoles at everywhere! then i rose 9 points for a great atmospheric gaming that they have created. cd project' big mistake is, they released this game for weak consoles. it's time to rid of these all old world consoles from existence. pc is the only true gaming platform from past to future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i've never seen a game this buggy. it crashed in the first two minutes of prologue. i had to download a communitymade patch from nexus to pass the first two minutes of the game! i wanted to like it. i really did. but it is so bugged it's ridiculous. every other quest is broken. wanna catch runaway ai cars? sorry, the script does not activate. wanna kidnap a person on top of a ? good job, but the lift is bagged on the way back, jump of the building, i guess. screw this. don't buy this game. don't waste your time and money."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,buggy and just plain boring. dont buy it unless youve got a super computer or just dont care.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"really solid and good game in terms of story and overall experience game gives you. poor technical side though, but it will be fixed soon. people crying about bugs and low fps, you didn't play games in 90's apparently d. can't wait for dlc's!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,the game is boring. i thought i will be something new with very interesting plot. and i was waiting this game. but unfortunatly. not interesting

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"pretty good game! not as awesome as the ads showed us, but still good. story, characters, visuals, music, sound design  top tier. strongly recommended."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"an amazing game that's unfortunately greatly brought down by the fact that it's a quite a mess. the story, characters, dialogue, writing, soundtrack, graphics and the universe are all amazing but, unfortunately, that's about all of the positives i can say about this game, the rest is negative or simply neutral. the combat is meh at best, i'm really not a fan of the borderlands bullet sponge combat, but i'm sure lots of people will enjoy it, the driving is really slippery and unsatisfying, the ai feels nowhere near finished and really ruins any feeling of depth that night city might have otherwise had, the game is not well optimized at all and there are tons and tons of bugs nonstop, although none of them game breaking. overall, i do still think it's worth full price, given the great story and the great amount of content, and it was able to keep me hooked from start to finish and the exact same thing can be said about every single friend of mine who played it. unfortunately, though, it did fail to leave a lasting impression, something i attribute to the game's overall jankiness. looking forward to playing it when they patch out all the glitches and hopefully add things to make night city feel more alive."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"oh 2020... why must this year bring so much disaster to the world. this game is a great show of this and i dont blame the developers quite frankly! the game was rushed by all means and cdpr was basically just buckling under the pressure presented to them. the game is buggy and textures arent so good, the story is boring and theres to much just sitting around listening to someone drone on and on about there life or something. the story is cdpr fault but the bugs and the graphics are not."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i finished cyberpunk in 31 hours and i can honestly say that i enjoyed every hour spent in the game. the world, direction, characters, quests and gunplay are on point! tech behind the game is huge and ive never seen such large stack of technologies used previously. on the bottom side  bugs and sometimes not that engaging main story line"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"just a great game with interesting gameplay. it's buged just as all cd project's games on release, but for 70 hours i saw only one really unpleasant problem fall under textures. everything else is awesome"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game feels incomplete and that is a shame. there are so many instances in the game where things feel rushed. navigating both your vehicle and your character feels cumbersome, also not much of what you say or do seems to change much of how the game plays. lacking several features that games before them did in smaller time frames, and so it feels like this game really needs to be made an example of for both the developers sake and future franchise titles. truly feel short."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"is this game finished? no is this game buggy? yes do the npcs need serious work? yes but, despite all the issues, this is still one of my all time favorite games. the world building is absolutely amazing, the attention to detail shows a great amount of love and passion was put into this world. the shooting, weapons and loot are of the highest quality but there seems to be an endless supply of content. the combat ai is actually pretty good, and makes for engaging fights, and higher difficulty settings make you engage in more of the weapons, mods, and engagement options. the story, voice acting and directing, and the dialogue are top notch. this goes through all the main quest and the side quests. the density of content is the highest that has ever been seen in an open world this large. everything is hand crafted, no procedural generation, giving a feeling of quality and importance to every square inch of the game. the insides of the buildings are packed with content and lovingly crafted. despite all of the bugs, the game has a very high quality to it. there is very little clipping and a very high level of detail in making all the animations look realistic down to the smallest details. all of the mechanics, systems and menus are very intuitive and easy to engage with, making it so there is no reason not to use every last feature. i honestly could keep going for days, talking about how amazing this game is. i understand the controversies behind this game, but i can't deny the love, passion, and long hours of work that went into this game by the developers. i am angry at cdpr for how they handled the release of this game, but that wasn't the fault of the developers, and i truly believe that this game will make a massive turn around over the next 6 months to a year. i gave it a 10, not because it's perfect, but because, despite all of its flaws it still managed to become one of my all time favorite games."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"lets keep with short. i have quite honestly never been more disappointed in a game in my life. i could sit here for hours and talk about the broken rpg systems, the performance, the game breaking bugs, but you've already heard that from other reviewers. i'm here to tell you that the idea that this game is somehow a great game if you play it on pc is wrong. in my opinion, this game needed many more years to cook before it was ready. this game will go down in gaming history as one of the biggest failures and greatest disappointments, from a company the community trusted more than any other."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"honestly love the game, glitches and all. recently my opinion changed, the 8mb save file max is the most obsurd thing i've ever heard. to tell people they're playing the game wrong by doing everything it has to offer is absolute garbage. i'll maybe revisit the game next year, for now i can't support something like this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"if you love the cyberpunk genre, this is a very masterpiecelike game that makes it a reality."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"en mi tarjeta rtx 3090 corre genial , ms que algn que otro error lo cual es completamente normal en juegos que salen es algo normal lo mismo paso con the witcher 3 hay mucho hate contra el juego por el tema que toca , y por el echo de que consolas antiguas como la ps4 o el xbox one no pueden correrlo bien , pero en pc es arte este juego , mecnicas divertidas , muchas secundarias , lo nico malo es que la historia principal es corta pero con todas las actividades secundarias que hay para hacer no hay queja es un juego muy completo ojal vayan arreglando los bugs y salga pronto el modo online"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i do not support the press that gives a rating provided all bugs are fixed. let's rate the game as it is it's an early alpha, a technical disaster, gta vice city 18 years late. the open world is poor, unrealistic, the interactions are minimal and badly done, the game is light years away from what the trailers were announcing. cd projekt made a fool of all the players."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"one of the greatest games since 2015. of course, it has plenty of technical problems and bugs but in comparison with other games of 2020 it deserves the highest grade."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"en todos estos aos de desarrollo cd project red no tubo el detalle de agregar buenas fsicas para el juego ? y adems de bugs constantes npc's que se teletransporta quien sabe a donde , policas que aparecen de repente cuando tienes nivel de bsqueda, texturas que no cargan, y infinidad de bugs que necesitara hacer una lista mejor lo hubieran puesto como un early access para no pasar vergenzas"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"bueno, primero es inegable que el juego no estaba terminado del todo en el aspecto de pulido se refiere, los bugs son muy molestos algunos, el rendimiento despues de parche que sacaron a los dias del lanzamiento arreglo un poco el rendimiento y anda mucho mas fluido. en cuanto a la narrativa, me parece un juego muy bueno en cuanto a ello, las misiones secundarias del juego perfectamente podrian haber sido misiones principales de otros juegos, muy disfrutable con el conjunto de mejoras que le puedes hacer a tu psj con cada subida de nivel y todo eso, a nivel de jugabilidad los bugs nublan un poco eso pero en si es buena, el manejo de los vehiculos si debo decir que es algo malo salvo por el porsche 911 carrera turbo que tiene un manejo por lejos de lo mejor del juego, pero tambien una cosa mala es por ejemplo que no existe un modo para personalizar tus autos, con 8 aos de desarrollo no barajar un aspecto asi es como meeh cuando tienes tiendas de comida por todos lados las cuales en mi opinion son un desproposito, por que la comida la pillas tirada en todos lados literal y ademas no te dan un plus en nada, no es que debas de comer constantemente para no morir o algo por el estilo como para tener tantas en el mapa, en las 100 hrs aprox que jugue nunca me toco comprar nada de comida por que en las mismas misiones te pillas por doquier consumibles, bueno esas tiendas perfectamente podrian haber sido por ejemplo talleres mecanicos para personalizar tu auto y por ejemplo tus partes mecanicas ya que estamos, tambien la nula opcion de cambio de look posteriormente a que te creas tu personaje, muchas veces quise cambiar un poco el estilo pues me entere que no... y es un poco ilogico que no puedas cambiar tu corte de pelo pero si puedes ir a ponerte unos brazos de gorilla y unas pantorillas hidraulicas... terminando es un buen juego pero le falta pulir un par de aspectos claves empezas por los bugs y todo lo demas, pero que su narrativa es excelente un juego disfrutable pero que te deja un sensacion de poco una vez que lo terminas,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"too much bugs, ps4 version is terrible, cd project gave so many promises about game and back out them."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"mi sento abbastanza sicuro nell'esprimere la mia opinione su questo gioco accattivante. ma niente pi. e' d'obbligo attenersi alla realt del gioco su piattaforma adatta e pertanto pi oggettiva possibile e non ovviamente a quella dei trailer. il gioco  godibile, tecnicamente parlando ha il suo perch e si pone sui livelli pi alti per quanto riguarda il comparto grafico, ma c' da dire comunque che l'immersivit non  affatto quella aspettata. la citt  viva si ma con le giuste interazioni e comportamenti degli npc sarebbe stata un'altra cosa. a tratti alcune pecche del gioco vengono fuori bug e glitch che per carit divina in un'opera cos vasta sono fisiologici che rovinano la non perfetta immersivit del gioco. per quanto riguarda il gameplay, l'ho trovato abbastanza carino, ma nulla di eccezionale, me lo sarei aspettato un pochino pi rilevante per quanto riguarda lo shooting e il corpo a corpo. la storia beh, nota di merito a cdpr per avermi tenuto gli occhi sullo schermo per l'ansia di sapere come va a finire il viaggio di v. ed in oltre, non da poco, a farmi legare ai  secondari. in fin dei conti, cyberpunk 2077 merita a parer mio un 8, media tra il 9 per quanto riguarda la lore e 7 per quanto riguarda la giocabilit effettiva, che diciamocelo, non offre quanto promesso. sono comunque soddisfatto, e spero in futuro di tornare a night city, ma stavolta per bene."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,every game starts with certain problems. i think the important thing is the story. the story of this game is amazing !

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game is absolutely great. i'm enjoying it right now and, however it could be polished better, cyberpunk 2077 is still best game of past years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"there are major issues with this game beyond bugs. the ai, lack of meaningful choices, poor writing, and predictable mission design all take away from what was supposed to be a different sort of game. unfortunately cyberpunk is not much different than what we've been getting from cookie cutter aaa titles since 2015."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"disclaimer i am running a pc version only on high settings using a rig, which meets the recommended requirements despite some minor glitches, which i have already seen in other aaa games, there's plenty to love about the immersive experience you can get here. almost every small questgig feels worthwhile and adds to the world. on top of that, there is a ton of systems to mess around with, which, while may not be balanced perfectly yet, make it an interesting rpglite gameplay. it has a great story, since this is primarily a story driven experience. sandbox elements are ok as well, i am actually glad we don't have filler content like minigames as in ubisoft titles. and if you are looking for more challenging gameplay  smarter ai, try playing it on hard. with time and more patches it should live up to the hype it was marketed with."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game is fantastic on so many levels. i won't lose time here writing pros and cons, already a lot of people did it.. just find one not written by a  and you're good. yeah it has bugs, but i've encountered none game breaking so  cdpr is resolving them quickly."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"there was so much hype around this game that that was bound to be some disappointment. that being said, there is a lot to be disappointed about. this was supposed to be a bold, immersive cyberpunk rpg. a playground for your custom tailored character with lots impactful choices and replayability. what we got was what you'd expect if you'd ask paul verhoeven to do an installment of grand theft auto. don't get me wrong, in that respect it's enjoyable enough. i played the game through for what it was, and had an okay time with it. but it really doesn't fulfill the expectations i had of it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the best game i've ever played except for the witcher. of course, the start wasn't so good for the game the optimization and bugs still requires a lot of work and fixes, but all this is compensated by an excellent storyline that will remain in the players' memories for a long time. cd project red are ready for risky decisions and what you find in this game you will not find in any project from ubisoft, ea, and other companies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i put 80 hours into cyberpunk. only because i was messing around with the photo mode a lot, which is really cool and shows the beautiful graphics. then i was also busy with the many many side jobs and gigs. fluff content. as for the main story? well it's very short and very unsatisfying when you get to the end. which i couldn't believe was the ending already once i got to it. overall with cyberpunk i expected a nextlevel mind blowing game. all the hype and description of what their game would be turned out to be a disappointment in reality. what we got was a gta game with prettier graphics and less options, a short story, and lots of fluff busy work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i'm changing my review. ai and npc's definitely need some work, just as world activities. game has many flaws but i can't give less than 9. story is so good, it made me cry multiple times... world, .. beautiful.. this is game of the decade material, please fix and add more activities cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i think there are many misconceptions around this game and that's a big reason why so many people are disappointed. for me personally it is the best game of 2020 a breathtaking open world as far as graphics are concerned, a great variety of different gameplay elements which are all fun and probably the most engaging main story and side quests in any game although this is a bit more subjective. of course it has its flaws at the moment but as far as i am concerned i had no gamebreaking bugs and maybe one crash in over 60 hours. i'm sure cdpr is going to patch it. performance on a 2 year old gaming pc was ok. i would recommend it to people who don't expect a gta like sandbox but a storydriven rpg like witcher 3."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,very short game. no motivation to do secondary quests. you can kill all by one hack skill and enemies don't know what to do...
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"funciona mejor en pc, realmente debi salir primero en esta plataforma y luego en consolas. lo que me molesta son las mentiras de la compaa y los bugs que demuestran lo apresurado que estuvieron en sacarlo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"rough diamond, i would give it a 8.510 with the potential to become a 1010 while it was a bit short, it has been the best singleplayer experience in my life, but the open world is lacking in things to do. no minigames like playing arcade machines or poker, you can't even sit on chairs, you can't buy new appartments while the trailer hints at that, no barber shop, no tattoo shops, and there is no customization of your vehicles. i also felt a bit dissapointed that you can't get back in the world again once the main missions are over. the game doesn't run well either. the game does have a lot of good side missions and gigs though. the singleplayer is just so good that the contrast between the rest leaves you with a bit of a bad aftertaste once you completed it. that said, it has been well worth the full price for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"cons  the bugs are terrible.  the world feels dead after the first 10 hours.  the npcs walking around the world only give oneliners and walk around like zombies.  the police don't have cars and therefore can't chase you even if they wanted to.  police spawn directly in front of you giving you zero chance to survive them and disappear when you drive 50 meters away  the controller sensitivity is really bad, even for an rpg.  the controller layout often leads to actions you don't intend to such as skipping dialogue when you need to crouch, going to the main menu instead of the ingame menu.  there is little to do outside of missions.  the ai is really bad, worse than most games of the last decade and more.  there is too much uninteresting loot to pick up and just clogs up your inventory.  buying cars is a hassle from the constant messages to the poor interface to browse them.  weapons seem repetitive after a while with little variety.  lack of variety in weapon attachments and customization.  clothing shops are too expensive and lack a variety of clothing, usually only having lowlevel items with only 30 items per shop.  can't customize your hairstyle after spawn screen for screenshots and general gameplay or anything else about your physical character other than clothes. this is an rpg you should be able to customize your character period  finding good crafting recipes seems borderline impossible.  npcs drive like complete idiots. they can't switch lanes to go around cars. they will stop dead in the middle of highways for no good reason. they will run into you and your car without trying to stop. they will get stuck in intersections and cause massive traffic and can't go around each other. it's so bad.  this game feels way too perverted with little variety in themes open world.  but somehow there is only one male and female joytoy prostitute in the entire world. makes no sense  the openworld does not seems to react to the story as you go along. major things happen and not much usually changes in the world itself.  all the streets are named, but you can barely see 95 of the street names. you can't see street or venue names on the main map or minimap making playing with no hud near impossible.  feels like the entire game needs a massive dlc just to make it complete  did i mention bugs on pc. i have had to reinstall the game three times, restart the game over 5 times, and reload saves a few dozen times.  the vast majority of things in this game is fake and noninteractable.  food is practically useless because it only has out of combat buffs that cannot be consumed in combat.  you have practically infinite medical supplies within the first hour making healing guaranteed and the game less threatening.  your character will overheat and take damage no matter what you do. pros  good story  a variety of side missions that all feel worth doing.  a variety of ways to build your character.  the graphics are gorgeous.  a city layout so lifelike that i never fast travel.  the cars all feel different.  currency in this game feels like you actually have to earn it.  likeable characters.  plenty of skills to acquire and upgrade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the game is just beautiful, interesting main story, interesting side quests, tiny details that please the eye and really beautiful graphics. unfortunately, the game has a lot of bugs and poor water physics, for example, but it can take you for many hours. overall im in love with the game and waiting for cdpp to fix bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i can't understand how anyone can rate this game under 8 on pc. i have played through the game in 55 hours now and don't regret any minute of it. yes, there are glitches, yes, the game needs more polish and yes, the weaponitemability system is not really good. but even without all these things the game is a wonderful piece of art. the characters, story and world are so immersive that i spent more time in this game than in any other recent game. the only things that i regret are some decisions i made in the story  which is also a good thing. cyberpunk is like a psycho test disguised as a scifi gta. decisions seem to have an impact and the world seems to be alive. characters call you, disappoint you or a disappointed by you. even the side stories immerse you. i never had the feeling that i was working on a todolist of any sort. the opposite i couldn't wait for some characters to call me again to go on with them. so yes. there are some bad things. but not a single one of them was able to destroy the immersion. best game in a long time. period."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"as of now, i played about 94 hours of cyberpunk during which i finished the main story, all the side stories and all the gigs. while the open world side i think has been vastly overhyped, the main story is really really awesome, keanu reeves delivers on one of his best performances i've seen as of yet, and the character side missions are really wholesome and heartwarming. about the bugs, i have encountered a few visual glitches as well as 2 instances where i couldn't properly finish some gigs but, aside from that, it's nowhere near as bad as other games i've played at launch, like pathfinderkingmaker. as a disclaimer, i have to say, i played on pc using geforce now with the founder edition subscription and, having a good internet connection, it worked for me at full ultra on 1080p with mostly stable 60fps. on consoles it's a whole other story but this is a review for the pc version. rpg wise this is about as rpg as witcher 3. it's an action game with rpg elements. but if i want an rpg i'll go back to playing pathfinderkingmaker or baldur's gate 2. normally i'd give the game a 8.5 or 9, because the open world aspect is pretty poor, especially when compared with what other titles like red dead redemption 2 or gta 5 have to offer, but since i see a lot of console people coming to the pc reviews category to trash the game with 010, i'll just go ahead and give it a 10, to even the odds a bit."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,this game is a real game but you need to have a really good machine to see it. the best game ever. masterpiece storyline and gameplay.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"so wasn't expecting gameplay to be anything earth  although did think there would be some sorta enemy ai atleast but guess not. anyway what i was expecting was a good story, but i have to say pretty soon as act 2 started the game took a turn for the worse. basically it wasnt v's story. she was just the chauffeur for someone else and it got pretty boring actually. everything was futile and felt like there was clear picture what is the right thing to do and what is  too much hand holding overall. this game relies on the player being interested in johnny. if that doesn't happen then tough luck.. theres not much more to it. more personal story woulda been nice and offered more roleplay chances. the setting was cool though and city was amazing. did make me miss that 3rd person view though"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"long story short if there would be no bugs the game would be at least 710 so far i am like 15 hrs into the game i am playing on old gtx 970, so far no crashes. there are clipping issues occasionally guys walking through doors, sinking into the floor, i had to save and reload three times once i got stuck somewhere, the second time my car didnt want to drive, the third time my companion npc disappeared  i couldnt hear her voice but could hear v replies. but let's be honest, it is not witcher 3. the main problem is that game doesnt excel at anything  shooting is good but not great, driving around is good but not great, visuals are good but not great, story line is good but not great, characters are good but not great. on top of this you have some bugs even if not that many in my case, but i guess there are systems which are more buggy. i must say i am disappointed, i am cdpr fan, was waiting for this game, preordered first time ever, as a gratitude token for w3 and this happened. i can understand how people are annoyed"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"the 1010 ratings are a  joke. because of people like them and because of the corrupt pc gaming review sites scandals like this get forgotten way to quickly. the story is good but far from being a masterpiece. gamemechanics are very poor, rpgelements are basic as  npcs have no brain, city looks so soulless... and so on. what a cluster. we all waited for this game to get over the ed up 2020... but it showed how ed this year really is. dont get me wrong. i know cdpr will patch most of the bugs out of the game. but the soul of this game needs improvement."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"just one of the best games i've ever played. i'm playing it on a relatively old laptop, at medium settings, and it looks great and play great. i'm a fun of skyrim, so the bugs and glitches are not a big deal. the gameplay and all the interactiveness of the world are well made, and the rpdfpsexploration elements are equally weighted."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"i apologize for my english, i write with google translate. i played over 100 hours all i want to say is that after completing the game i had the feeling that i passed the game from ubisoft, a huge bunch of additional quests that are made just to prolong your stay in the game  this is my main complaint about the game. as for the pros great music, not a bad style for my taste, there are interesting quests and characters although there are very few of them. now to the cons a very short main campaign it is quite interesting, but very short, a huge number of uninteresting additional quests about 60, a weak romantic line especially in comparison with the witcher, i don't have much to say about optimization1060 6gb, i57400, 8gb ram, personally, i had almost no problems with fps, it only bothered that often npcs did not load and machines disappeared in the visible area bottom line i do not regret that i paid money for this game, but it turned out at times worse than the witcher trilogy. very weak additional tasks are definitely not the level of a cd project, optimization problems, in my opinion, are not even the main problem of this game, there are not very many really memorable characters, interesting tasks and a really dead world in which manual work on the world is not felt. it's a pity i was waiting for this game for 3 years and i didn't think that it would blow up the industry, i was just waiting for a good game with interesting characters and stories, but i got a game that consisted of 40 of the game from the cd project and 60 of the game from ubisoft ... i also forgot to mention that the game often has the illusion of choice as it was in the telltale games games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,i don't understand why this has so many negative reviews the graphics are beautiful the character's are amazing and the main story line should at least take you 35 hours if you don't skip the dialogue. after 75 hours i've had one game braking bug and no game crash.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"despite the few bugs here and there, the game play is fun, the combat is tight and responsive and the story and side missions are really good. one of the best games i've played in a while"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"this game, as i'm writing this around the patch 1.04 and 1.05, it is a mixed bag. the game itself plays well from a gameplay perspective and has a nice story and gives you a lot to do and such, it is a good openworld experience, but it is quite riddled with bugs, from clipping models to one minor sidequest becoming incompletable to save file corruptions if you play long enough to moments where if you land in a specific way on a space, it makes it so that you get instantly ko'd, to the game actually running quite sluggishly even on low settings my setup is a ryzen 3600 and a nvidia 1080 ti. you might want to wait until the game gets its patches, and my review score of 7 is taking 13 points off for how buggy it is, otherwise i would rank it around 8 to 10."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"we were sold an immersive open world 'rpg'. we got a casual looter shooter with buckets full of unfinished features and bugs  with underwhelming gameplay instead. the only reason to even play this game is for the art direction, atmosphere and story, the rest is just not worth it. from the laughable 'rpg' aspect of the game to strange arcadey driving or the complete lack of interaction with the city  npcs. the boring spongeshooting fest that gunfights where you'll empty magazine after magazine into mindless ai, and shovel piles and piles of the same looking gun to clog up the already cluttered and horribly designed interface. the stealth approach is just an exercise in frustration and simply does not work. most of the items you pick up are completely useless and only serve to make money or 'craft'. aside from the main  side quests there is simply nothing to do in night city. overall the game tries to convey a sense of complexity and depth but after the few hours playing through the prologue and completing a few quests you soon realise it was all just smoke and mirrors and that the game has the depth of a puddle. i do not think any amount of fixes or dlc content can make this game any better than just 'mediocre' which is a shame considering the potential that the game's universe had."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,ok bugs are there but they will be gone. the game itself is a marvellous thing. stopping me from giving it 1010 is lack of random events and npcs interactions on the loop and missing features as per link omitted per site rules
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"we got ripped off by cdpr. i hope you lose compensation cases and go bankrupt. this is not next gen open world rpgaction game this is non finished gta 5. even if we ignore the bugs and crashes the game is awful. there is no optimization, no artificial intelligence, no interaction or impact to game world or npcs. nothing about future, guns same, cars same, humans same, buildings same. cars move like aladdin's carpet. adding breed cats to street and chrome makeup to humans doesn't make futuristic game. 2020 las vegas is more futuristic than junk city. swimming and police mechanics it's worse than gta san andreas. main guests are ordinary, not exciting or curious. side guests are same just go kill and take the bag, chip, money etc. i'm now understand the real value of rockstar games or ubisoft games."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,i had a high expections just like everyone. and i must say even with hilarious amount of bugs my 80hours spent in the game i havent encountered any serious ones. awesome story underlined by very deeply detailed characters and fluent gameplay maybe crafting could use some more love and balancing as of you being overhelmingly powerful thanks to that but at the same time its taking ages to level up a crafting skill. i'd love to give higher rating but i just feel for the current state of game it's more than sufficient.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-22,"contrary what many some i highly doubt even played the game here say the have is absolutely incredible. it's beautiful, big and for me, it really looks alive. maybe y'all should try running this on some actually decent hardware and not expect the new game to run 60fps on your sorry ass 10yo fx8350. can't say i didn't encounter any bugs, but they were minor, like and walking through my car i parked like a moron. nothing major, no crashes, not game breaking stuff. sure the game might feel overwhelming at first and it suffers from what i call borderlands quests effect too many quests and things to do given to you at once. but the characters are deep and well written and most of the quests feel immersive. the game isn't perfect, but it's not at all bad either. next time cdpr ignore the fans and release only when ready. it's better to let the hype train die a bit than to let it eat you alive. 810"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"we all know about the bugs and poor release of the game. so not gonna talk too much about that, especially since i myself haven't had to deal with many bugs. my game has crashed once, and other than pop ins here and there, really haven't had performance issues or glitches. with that said before diving into my review, i do wanna say gamers deserved this. gamers often act like entitled brats, and when this title was delayed gamers took to social to rage and some even sent death threats to the devs. now yall see why they kept delaying the game and frankly it should have been delayed again. with that said, i think this is a solid game. it's not great by any means, it has it's moments of being a good game, and moments where it's clear cdprojektred aren't that experienced with making a shooter. hand to hand combat outright  in the game. melee weapons are ok but wonky. the gunplay is hit or miss. the game shines with it's world obviously as well it's characters. which isn't a surprise, it's cdprojektred. good characters for them is just normal. the story is ok, sometimes it does seem all over the place but at times gets back on track. pacing is solid and side quest are ok as well. other than the poor graphics on x1, the previous mentioned downsides, it's all an all a good game. i plan on buying it a second time on pc to try it out close to what it was meant to be played, because let's be honest, this game was made to be maxed out on a 3080, not optimized to be played on ps4 or x1."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i was lucky to not experience that much in the way of bugs. however, the game itself, though a beautiful world has hardly any of the content we have become accustom to in cdpr games. there is virtually no side quest quality stories of the grade of tw3. the side content is more on par with ubisoft's filler than the previous quality. i hope that cdpr realise this a release some of the much wanted content for the amazing empty world they have created. fingers crossed we see it in 202122..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"finaly! a singleplayer game worth spending hundreds of hours. if you are into heavy gunfights and endless battles, don't play this game! it's for those who want to dive deep into a well told story and explore many some things of our future. you need to read letters, talk to many people and feel the story come alive. also don't complain about graphics if you play a state of the art game with software from the last century and want a aaaa game released before it's finished. it's your fault then!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i've had a close friend since highschool  we do business together now. we both do well  so our wives dont complain about us having an isolated game week once every 3 years or so. we go all out  get the merch  setup a schedule which ensures the most productive gameplay hours possible  isolate ourselves. we call it our hunting trip. weve done oblivion, skyrim, gta, fallout new vegas, fallout 4, diablo 3, minecraft, and a few starcraft sessions. we determine the length of the trip by the impact of the game  skyrim previously held the record at 5 days  we dedicated 6 to cyberpunk. we did what we needed to in order to ensure the best experience  remember  once every 3 years. we had bots and watchers  obtained the 3080 for both of us. i built an entire new pc  got a 12 core ryzen beauty. that all being said  we know most couldnt do this. what can we say  we lucked out. at the announcement of the original release date of november 19th or 18th? i had to tell my buddy  sorry wifes got nightshift too much weve both got little ones  the only window i had was december 11th to the 17th. so we agreed and planned for that  and it worked out incredibly well. now  we played 6 days straight  meals and a small workout sesh  from 8 am to 1 am next morning  about 80 to 90 hours total. we both loved it. we got some bugs  most almost all just gave us a good laugh. we both loved the plot  loved the characters, loved the incredible ray traced city, and liked the mechanics. look we played on hardest setting  some things are straight up op  but we get it  theyll be nerfed in the future. the expectations have become unrealistic for a game of this caliber  im an ee and low level coder  so i know a few things about it. the tech will get fixed  the balance issues will get fixed. the game is great  and i can see the maker's passions in every side quest. i cant say enough good about the game  cd project red  why have we not played witcher 3??? this game makes bethesda games look silly  in particular bethesda quests and story lines."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the game has it's problem on launch, yet i believe it's really good game. the story is interesting, gameplay gives multiple options on how to play, graphics are stunning pc, medium settings. what it lacks is polish not exactly their fault, because fans wanted the game out and were quite hysterical, content that was promised overhyped? a bit yes  missing car customization, barber and other body replacement, more options in clothing. the game also runs quite badly on older consoles which is understandable, yet they marketed it as old consoles friendly. i've finished the game in a week, really liked it. i'm looking forward for dlcs and more updates later, which will make the game better and hopefully fix all the bugs and problem."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"this game is glitchy, full of bugs and unless you have an expensive new gaming pc with powerful gpu your frame rates are going to be bad or fuzzy. i toned down the graphics so i could get at least 60fps but the game was fuzzy and lacked detail. it plays like an early access game but with a premium price of 60. the posted recommended pc requirements are false advertising territory and a downright lie, i feel like i got scammed. this is what i get for purchasing this mess at launch, lesson learned."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"cyberpunk 2077 is pretty good. it's not revolutianary, but i enjojed it. 810. but reading 03 rated reviews complaining about console portsthere is separate metacritic page for that, and people that wanted gta6it's not a gta, i decide to compensate the unfair rankings by giving this game 10. this game has an incredibly beatifull cityfirst game that made me enjoy riding in passenger seat, really touching characters, and complex questslike in witcher 3. it has some nonlinear options, but most of them unfortunately just allows to skip content. on my pcrtx 2080 it runs 80 fps qhd with medium rtx, thanks to dlss. it has a lot of bugs, but they are not gamebreaking, and for large openworld games it's pretty standartremember witcher 3 and skyrim on start. i enjoy the combat system, impact is good, just disable the damage numbers. if you loved witcher for nontrivial side quests, this is the game for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"really good game, i'm 75h in and still enjoying the game. the last open world game that had me this invested was breath of the wild. once they iron out the bug this game ia a 1010 so thats what im giving it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,played on xbox one x and the game would lag here and there and sometimes and act funky at times but nothing out of the ordinary for a new game. overall absolutely loved the game have already spent hours playing and still have tons left to do despite what other people say cdpr did a fantastic job on the game and i cant wait to see what they do in the future with it
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"pros  detailed environment immerse  amazing storylines and endings  the music integration  my character doesn't pop out because of the customization  amazing side quests  i cried finishing the game, and saw the credit scene all i don't usually do that, and i've been playing for more than 15 years already  it played very smoothly on gt1030 even... cons  some release bugs like the cars respawning and npc shifting but still it should be fixable still, so doesn't really matter much"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"on the upside, the graphics, the soundtrack, the city itself, the characters, the voice acting, the gameplay and the story telling are out of this world. vehicles, clothing, and music fits so well together and with night city, very immersive. choices matters in this game. i will only say that, sometimes, if you go out of your way to try to make something happen, it might just happen, even if it seemed desperate . on the downside, the ai is lacking and the game is buggy i only experienced minor bugs but i played on an high end pc. the downsides are insignificant compared to the upsides. it has been a long time since i got hooked so much by a video game. this game is great. don't listen to review saying that the world is lifeless or that your actions have no impact, those come from people that did not play the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i didnt write any reviews because i dont know how, so ill be brief. first of all, i would like to express my deep gratitude to the developers for such an amazing experience in a singlecoil game. so the pros great graphics. the rtx picture makes the picture simply incredible and you will never want to turn it off. a huge living city, multilevel. stunning detail of everything and everyone. an excellent storyline, elaborate side quests and tasks. a lot of references  5 points. the shooting did not disappoint, the weapon is felt, the impact is there. those who do not like the way driving on cars is implemented and do not like the impossibility of improving them  go to the forest, the game is not about that. cons the city is well implemented in terms of filling people and cars, but the stupidity of these dummies is discouraging. no interaction with them, why? there are a lot of buildings, but you cannot enter them. the choice in the dialogues does not affect anything. for owners of consoles and calculators, which people for some reason call pc  change your buckets at last and plunge into an amazing game with gorgeous graphics and a bomb plot. i would also like to wish the developers to cope with mass psychosis and hate in relation to you. you are on the right way. everyone  i would like to wish more real aaa blockbusters, necessarily single ones. leave the online shooters for the students."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the best game i have ever played. i played through cyberpunk 2077. although it has a lot of flaws, it is the best game for me. i would like to thank the people who programmed this game for this great experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"let's start by saying that this game isn't perfect. there are bugs and a few glitches for sure but, at least for me, there hasn't been any game breaking bugs or glitches. i'm playing on a midrange pc and the game so far has been an absolute blast! the story and quests are extremely engaging and the characters are well developed and feel real. i'm loving the interactions between v and johnny and i love how your life path gives you different options when dealing with the various npcs around the city. sometimes you get different insight options, other times you get options for how to move a quest forward. i also really like the gun play and mod systems and cyberware systems. this is really where the game shines. you can pick the kind of weapon you want to use, pick your stats to compliment that choice and then enhance your abilities with the various cyberware options available to make yourself into a true force to be reckoned with. the other thing i like is the upgrade system. if you find a gun early on that you really like, you can upgrade it as you level to keep even low level guns and gear relevant to use as you go up in levels. all this being said, like i said at the beginning, there are bugs and glitches. the worst i've seen so far was an npc that got stuck in an elevator and a few npcs that got stuck in some stairs. neither of these were game breaking for me and none of the other bugs i've seen, mostly visual glitches like looking in the mirror and seeing my character as bald instead of having hair, have been game breaking as well. overall, the game is really amazing and looks really good and i do recommend it to anyone playing on pc. if you're on console, i still recommend playing the game, but waiting until the patches in january and february come out that are supposed to fix the console problems."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"like many others i agree that even without the bugs and glitches this game is an nonimaginative mess. a large mix of bland artmusic, poorly designed gamemechanics and headache inducing ui. i am not even gonna go into the scripted corridor style mess either. overhyped garbage."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"it is a completely broken and unplayable game on pc and consoles. i recommend letting a year or two go by and then buying it, it's not even worth pirating."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the game at launch was no different from any other cdpr title, it was riddled with bugs, had texture pop issues, frame rate instability and the dreaded crashes. its been 11 days since the games release and most of this has been patched out with two large hot fixes. the game is in a good place, i dont honestly get what all the hate is about. its almost like most of the reviews comments from people about the game have never played a cdpr title or any game for that matter. i give it another month or two before the games unrecognizeable from launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,played it on pc with 2070s oc haven't seen any major bugs. they didn't give us everything they promised but i still enjoyed the game.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i'll be blunt. story 7.5, 3 points because of keanu gameplay 6, nothing new about it, plus it moves in combat just like a game in 2014. optimization 3. overall, a decent game with an above average story. nothing 'breathtaking though. sadly, if this is the game they worked on for so many years... i am really dissapointed in that regard. my note 5.5, maybe 7 without bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"played 25 hours on 4 days, i can't stop playing this game but have to work huhu. i don't have critical bug yet and only few little bug that's not block my progression. and after all i trust in cdpr to continue improve the game and offer free additionnal content like they did with witcher 3. drm free, no microtransaction the spirit of this studio think that much media don't like cdpr and try to down the game since 6 mounth maintain gamer anger to manage to hurt the studio because they don't like it for some reason. and life choices, critic i've seen a lot can change some conversation  means on the entire game also bug i'ts almost ''roleplay'' feature after prologue. i think many people that give pc version a 0 don't have really play the game on pc or expet play gta 5 in future or maybe a random fps without soul and background."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"quite the masterpiece that got ruined by bugs and unholy hype . i loved this game more than i thought i would after seeing all the bugs and the backlash over it's release state and there is alot wrong with this game fundamentally wrong , from gameplay and rpg elements to how the game as a whole is designed but man it's charming . first that city man it's one of the best i ever had the pleasure of roaming around in , it's quite unbelievable that they managed to create that space 2nd the characters are well made here from the ai del to silverhand all main and side characters are very good, all i wish is that we had the chance to explore them more and see them interact with each other rather that just seeing them in their own little boxed stories . 3rd music, this game has an insane array of music that makes it feel alive, though nothing in the combat music felt special the music you hear in the different parts of the city with the different factions and the ones on the radio are quite amazing and give a real sense of realism to the world at the end play this game later when it's fixed and have more to offer that it's vanilla state cuz that is a masterpiece but this on the other hand is just a good buggy game"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i think people are overreacting on this game. i honestly really enjoyed the story, which was well put together. i found the bugs to be minor ones that didn't really matter that much. just wish the choices you make would mean more but instead almost the same thing happens throughout the story, no matter which choice you pick. also the poor performance people are talking about is flat out a lie at least on pc. the game runs very well and looks beautiful. in the 50 hours i played the game crashed a total of 0 times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,not just a game but a whole  experience. i personally haven't encountered any major technical bugs and absolutely loved every part of the game. only thing i don't like is the fact that it had to end.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"just beat the main story and i really enjoyed it. having played it on pcobviously..., i did encounter a few bugs and a few crashes on my outdated machine6 year old build, updated with a 1070 a few years later, but the game looked and played greatusually at about 40fps..., but still. i'm really hoping cdpr takes the time to give this game the polish it deservessee what i did there?, since it is a little rough around the edges. the story overall is pretty great, especially for an open world game. almost every little quest on the map has johnny silverhand popping in to give his take on the situation, and it's fun to watch his dynamic with the playable character and how their dynamic changes as you pass certain milestones. i'm hoping cdpr reworks act 1 at some point though there are some moments at the end of act 1 that are supposed to be impactful but really you haven't spent enough time in this world at that point to be invested. hopefully, dlc down the line will expand on the main story as well, don't want to spoil too much there though. i also hope they take the time to really rework the battle progression system. it has solid core, but the perks and leveling mostly result in  or numerical bonuses instead of anything that shakes up your build. definitely falls a little flat, especially with the poor difficulty scaling. early game you're best served picking off opponents onebyone using stealth, and when you get caught it will usually result in death. by the end of the game you get powerful enough that you can blow through more difficult encounters without being nearly as careful. allinall, what i've said so far can be said for the other aspects of the game. battle is fun but it needs a little more work. improving ai for both regular npcs and enemies would really help with overall immersion. economy progresses well but near midgame you can afford the best implantsgear but the optional cars remain prohibitively expensive even past the endgame. crafting is a little oversimplistic but is worth the investmentreally need the ability to multicraft items. you have to single craft components which is ridiculous. the one thing this game doesn't need any work on is the world building. night city is huge and sprawls out both horizontally and vertically. it feels appropriately sized, with the heart of the city sprawling several miles that would take you a few hours to cross on foot. there is on area at the end of the story for one of the companion characters that was truly amazing, and it blew my mind that the developers created this whole breathtaking area for an optional quest thataccording to achievements maybe only 20 of players will ever see. so going forward, i really hope cdpr delivers on their promises to fix the game. my plan is to revisit the game eventually, probably after some dlc comes out. i want to replay the game as a female v, and to try it on the highest difficulty. i'd also like to try my hand at the secret ending, which apparently you can permanently miss if you don't choose the correct dialog options during a specific side questyou've now been officially warned. so hopefully by the time i decide to replay the game, many of the issues i discussed will have been fixed, and i'll be able to enjoy the game even more the second time around."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"let's just dive straight into it. the world of cyberpunk is perhaps one of the best looking one's i've ever seen. although it is not as open as i would like it to be it is still one hell of a masterpiece. the story itself also is a good point about this game, however i do wish that the missions would be more indepth. and thats when we come to the critism already actually. this game was supposed to be an open world rpg, to me it feels less then an rpg then outer worlds, and way less open world then gta. which  because the world it self is beautifull and i wish there was a reason to stay longer. most of the characters in the game are very intresting, yet though the amount of interaction with all the other side characters feels barely enough. there is no real rpg in between the characters besides some text messages. choices you make are of little influence beside some choices which is a shame. the ai is perhaps one of the most  things i've ever seen and needs a complete overhaul. this counts for police and citizens in night city. also it lacks alot of depth in just to many aspects to all write down here. however i'm hopefull for this game therefore the high rating i believe that if this game will get some good major patches, lots of love and attention from cd projekt red, and more time... alot of more time. this game can be one good single player game, and for the multiplayer... man oh man am i curious. tl dr good looking game, but it isnt what it was promoted to be nor really great. good story however."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the best game i have ever played in my entire life. yes, there are bugs but it's only first week after premiere. the gameplay, story and graphics are so stunning. i could play this game forever. the characters feel so real, i think i have a crush on one of them. really worth buying, even with bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"hard to express just how big of a disappointment this game is. it gets a 3 for being basically functional on pc and technically having things to do. aside from the performance issues, the game is empty, lifeless, and nothing like what they described. it's like a storebrand gta clone that's not anywhere near as good as gta, missing key features that come standard in literally every other openworld game in 2020. the one saving grace could be the main story, and story oriented side missions, which can be quite fun and engaging at times but they are mostly sad, boring conversations with depressing people about how things never work out the way you'd like. no kidding, cdpr, no kidding."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"at least for pc, the epicness of gameplay, graphics and story are far far more important the the flaws. cd projekt deserves a 10 for this masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"literally, no ai in the game. no combat ai, no driving ai, no npc ai. full of bugs. unjoyful game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"while it run smoothly on my pc with very little performance drops and no crashes i have a strongly mixed feelings about it. the map is large, graphics is good, soundtrack is nice, there's a lot of writing and voice overs. it's clear that an army of decent artists worked on that. on the actual game side it's completely different story combat is very basic, there are basically four enemies and one bullet sponge variant. enemies give up fighting you after you crouch behind cover few times. whole aming, dodgning and melee reminds me of bad maken x clone. that game was released in 1999. there is no ai in this game. opponents just shoot, move a bit, and get confused as  when you crouch behind a crate. sneaking is bad. enemies freeze in place and repeat constantly two sentences when alerted. at one time they will see you while you're behind them, at other they won't notice you in front of them. robots cannot be taken down so you're left with loud option. just like deus ex, some bosses just must be fought so full stealth build is not an option. driving has an input delay and feels unresponsive. dialog system promises you freedom of choice but all you can choose are mostly some minor things that play out almost immediately. some choices do not affect the course of play at all. main story is super boring and badly written. 90 of the time you listen to poor dialogs and very weak exposition. pretty much nothing is shown and everything is told. even keanu sounds bored and ashamed to be in it. it's a spit in the face of original pondsmith material. side quests are a bit better because there's some gameplay in them even though every side piece of content is basically fetch an item or slap a baddie. there are like three braindances which are basically short point and click minigames and only in main story. even if they fix technical issues it's still objectively one of the worst games. game's high budget and good graphics are like a jedi mind trick, work only on the weak minded. everything is bugged, everything is glitching. if it's in the game there's something wrong with it. and if someone's giving it more than 510 there's something wrong with himherthem. another pretty but shallow game courtesy of people who give high scores. that's why we can't have nice things. thanks  s."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"first of all i was very hyped with this game, because i love penpaper rpgs. and i loved the idea of having a pp rpg game on pc. and i knew that my old hardware can't handle the game so updated before the game came out. now that i have played the game a while, i want to review it. it's have some bugs. some minor and some bigger. but there not affecting the fun that i have playing it. the graphics look really great and there are plenty of details. even without raytracing. and yes, i know that on low and medium settings the world looks not beautiful. this can be frustrating. but what does people expect when they play the game on hardware that is 7 years old. and yes i directly address the console gamers. yeah it's not optimised. and this is one thing that you can accuse cd projekt red. but what game nowadays is optimised. all triple a titles are badly coded cause to the time and budged. the sound is good. you can choose between many genres, on the radio. the speech sound is average, not ground braking. the sounds from weapons, cars, doors, and so on is also pretty normal. not much to complain. now the most important part, at least on my perspective. the story. first of all. yes the story is great and well written. but it's more like an movie then an rpg game. you have sometimes multiple options but the outcome is the same. the world over all feels alive but empty. you can barely have a conversation with npcs. they only say one sentence. the controls are good, except the close combat and there specifically the fist fight. it feels clumsy. the rest is fine and intuitive. but does all this infect the fun that i have playing the cyberpunk. no. sometimes i want to change details in the story or the interaction. but maybe this will be possible with mods. the bugs aren't disturbing, ok the large part of the bugs. some are even funny to watch or had helped me. i don't understand the console community. what did they expect. but cd projekt had made a mistake. they shouldn't had released the game for the old consoles. but i think this was an management decision and not from the programmers. i hope cd pr will recover from this and will release other very good games in the future. sorry for my bad english. my setup amd ryzen 3700x, 16gb ram, nvidia rtx 1070 and game is on an m2 ssd, so it loads really quick."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i'm puzzled by all the bad reviews cyberpunk has gotten. i'm totally confused. i plopped down 1300 for a pc that can run this game almost specifically for this game. and i'm completely satisfied with my purchase. more than satisfied. when i was a kid in the 80's and 90's, this game was a far distant dream that could never be. and now here it is. the graphics are mind mending. there is a giant, gorgeous world to explore, people to meet, things to do. i can't think of a single game that comes close to this in scope and execution. this game is the reason to buybuild a gaming pc. i don't know what it's like on console, maybe it really does . but if you have a pc that can run this game with even close to full graphics, oh wow. you don't even need to play it to appreciate what cdprojekt red has accomplished. just walk down the street in night city and prepare to be blown away. i'd spend 1000 just to be able to play this for 10 hours. and it would be money well spent. beautiful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the best game ever. masterpiece. it's a deep, philosophical, honest game with incredible detail. there's nothing like it today."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"releasing this version was a mistake, but delaying couldnt be better. stupid ai and glitches are impossible not to mark, but this will be fixed. i bet, that cdpr compensate everything  storyline, characters, graphics, soundtrack are amazing. game still should be 810 since they dont fix it. and please, stop crying... did u really thought, that such a big game will run smoothly on 7 years old hardware? xd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"my experience with this game wasn't as bad as others since i bought it on pc, i thoroughly enjoyed it and would play it again, it is a little buggy not gonna lie and i know people are not exaggerating with the gameplay since alot of people have evidence that prove how buggy this game is, the gameplay needs to be fixed but the story was great, its a fresh story and i loved it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"volevo vivere un avventura cyberpunk come quella che ho vissuto nel gioco cartaceo , speravo che ci fosse veramente la possibilit di essere liberi di sperimentare e provare un esperienza nuova . no . questo non  assolutamente quello che mi aspettavo e che mi era stato promesso. tralasciamo i bug , glich e via discorrendo . ma davvero sono gli stessi che hanno fatto the witcher 1 , 2 , 3 ? questo gioco  amputato sotto molti aspetti . la progressione del pg  inutile se con un set corpo a corpo a mani nude rompi il gioco in pochi lv . ia inesistente !! ho aspettato tanto per questo . . non dovevo fidarmi ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"besides being a fun game with a good story, awesome characters, a lot of content and a great open world, it still falls short on it's own ambition. the game is a buggy mess, even on the pc, and that's not the end of the problems, the game has terrible a.i for the npcs, unpolished animations, tposes, etc. resuming, it's not worth it in this condition, maybe in the future they will get this game fixed and i hope so."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the game is not finished, i might review it again in february 2021. at the state it is right now it is almost unplayable unless you have a very powerful pc which is something cd pr never clarified"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"great rpg where you can feel the character. people say that there are no meaningful choices but perhaps they don't see that even our gameplay style changes the world. you do some simple quest with killing few bandits? next day there is a marketplace open in that spot. you go on rampage during one mission and then try to cooperate with some fraction? they will remember that and even attack you. it's worth playing but i will wait with my second playthrough for some more fixes. sure there is still some work to be done but i had a great time playing this game. i'm looking forward to see some fixes, multiplayer and dlcs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"great game.. the story, characters and side quests are lovely and on par with the witcher series. one point off due to the terrible a.i"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"what can i say about cyberpunk 2077 ? guys, game is unfinished  yes has bugs, glichtes, pedestrians with stupid ai, not optimized, but to be honest, i can't stop playing this title. the world of cyberpunk has  me in and i love it. the graphics, huge implementation of raytracing, character style, outfits, weapons, mods, cars looks awesome, you name it, it all makes me really enjoy this trip. has it been released too soon?  yes, but you cannot blame cdpr only. there is more than that. and i belive in cdpr, they will finish the game and make it shine as they intend to. peace out people, and i see you in the streets of night city."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"cp 2077 is an open world action fps, well written, with some beautiful characters and the best choreography of all time nc is simply amazing which sadly is really mediocre in all other departments the worst ai in recent video game history , poor interaction between environmental, physical, rpg and sthealth mechanics. overall optimization far below the standard of a triple a game ... and yes, it's partially broken even after patch 1.05. i hope they will fix some of the worst bugs, but how can you rewrite the game's ai without destroying the game itself? it's a mess."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i'm annoyed that the reviews here are either 1010 or 010 so lemme keep this honest and succinct. i'm reviewing the game how it launched as that's what the cdpr considered the complete and finished version of the game, but i will note that post patch 1.05, performance and bugs have improved i waited 8 years for cyberpunk and whilst clearly the game did not live up to the hype, it's still an incredibly enjoyable experience. it's just so unfortunate that the launch overall was unacceptable. graphics the game even on medium settings is quite pretty. my hardware defaults to high preset for some reason but even from that and seeing the rtx stuff, the game looks phenomenal on those settings. night city is such an exciting environment to explore and one of my favourite aspects of the game is just driving around and taking in the atmosphere. just be warned on low the game looks quite flat and given the launch performance, that's how most people who don't have the latest high end hardware will have to experience the game. plus it can take a while for the engine to load in textures on occasion leading to that heavily memed ps1 aesthetic though i have to admit i find it oddly charming. some people have also complained about substandard effects like bullet decals on water but that's relatively minor for me personally. sound the soundtrack has a nice mix of genre's especially the radio's with a mix of ambient electronic, metalpunk, rap and more aggressive techno. go listen to the pacific dreams station, it's fantastic. weapon and vehicle sounds are pretty okay, nothing ground breaking. i have noticed however that audio can occasionally disappear from guns due to bugs. story i won't go into any spoilers and i haven't completed the final mission but from what i've played so far i've enjoyed the story quite a lot. apart from the irony of corporate exploitation being the central point and cdpr forcing staff to do 6 months straight of over time, the game handles mature topics extremely well and hit me in the feels. as someone who has dealt with depression and anxiety, i felt that particular topic was well handled. however, i've noticed some dialogue that just doesn't work when asking every single question in the dialogue tree and even though keanu reeves is godtier, i find some of johnny's writing in particular, lacklustre. in addition, a lot of side quests have perceived choice where in reality, their is only one actual outcome. gameplay. shooting stuff is fun, driving is fun, melee combat is clumsy, augmenting yourself is neat since especially the powered jump. basically think open world sandbox deus ex human revolution. unfortunately i feel the game misses the bar in terms of being an immersive sim but i'm not 100 that's what the devs were going for. i've had friends also complain that other than quests the world is quite barren. performance  bugs pre 1.05 the game was awful. i've had people say the game runs fine for them but completely discredit those who've had a less than stellar experience. it's not that it's unplayable for me, but it was for some pals and i feel that the overall experience was diminished from having to lower graphics, deal with inconsistent fps, crashes and a plethora of bugs such as broken ui elements, getting locked into place needing a reset, broken physics, gun models disappearing, enemies floating and tposing away during cutscenes, i could go on. it's also important to mention that i had specs above the recommended for high with no raytracing. at launch i had to keep the game to midlow with still some frame drops due to poor optimisation, especially in some areas like outside the apartment, chinatown and japantown. sometimes frames would just die for no reason and stay that way until i reset the entire system. other times i had to hard reset my pc because the game just randomly locked up everything. ethics this game was built on false advertising, abuse of the development team and severe mismanagement. i find that poignant to mention for some folk. tldr a fun game that doesn't live up to the hype. it looks pretty if you can run it but it launched buggy as hell and the devs were hella shady. i would have rated it an 8 if i hadn't of noticed most of the things are done better in other games and it didn't launch so naff."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"night city is an astounding masterpiece offering a specific kind of immersive experience i have rarely encountered before. a beautifully detailed world design, well developed and emotionally engaging characters and a fabulous storyline intertwined with various side quests are the most impressive ingredients of this openworld rpg. physics and ai need further development for the game to realize its full potential. still 910."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"great game, played for 50 hours, game design and storyline just top. but bugs and poor optimization destroyed all ratings for the game. i give an estimate for the year ahead, when all the major patches are released."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the sheer amount of bugs is ridiculous. unacceptable in a full priced aaa game. the game play is generic the role playing is next to nonexistant, the open world feels lifeless and constantly takes you out of the game with completely odd ai behavior. it's bad. and even if the bugs are all patched out the game itself is so poorly  open worlds events are all crush gangs for cops most of your bounties are from cops, cops themselves are nearly invincible and immune to your  of the main characters loaths sex workers. this is a conservatives idea of cyberpunk where the cops and corporations are the heroes. fitting then that conservative gamers have made this part of their culture war...they're welcome to the game frankly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"the bugs in cyberpunk 2077 are not the main issue, the main issue is that at least 50 of the game's features that were in night city wire and trailers were cut out. it has the worst ai i've ever seen in an open world game, boring repetetive side missions, awful lootershooter system, awful progression system, the story is only good thanks to keanu reeves, etc. overall... awful but playable. 510 from me"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"amazing game, i enjoy 'd it immensely and looking forwards to more content to come. is this a perfect game? no sadly it is not, i am not blind to the negative reviews for the unplayable state on other platforms. which is the main reason i don't give it a higher score. is the game perfect? no game is perfect, but a 910 when the bugs are ironed out, the updates made it playable for everyone. i hope everyone can enjoy the game as i did. my platform was pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"for me this game fails the basic of world building. it fails to make me feels part of this world. they are 2 aspects that would solve this issue. the first one is the bug and performance. the second is the reality mechanic of any open world game. everything that is supposed to be alive is either not implemented or dysfunctional. i'm talking about npc driving and on the street, the police officer that cannot drive a car. somethings could be fix in a couple of months but other things need to be done from scratch since a lot of things is simply not there. in my mind, if the studio can get through this, we will have a great game in a couple of years."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i completed cyberpunk 2077 on 100 with every campaign so i will tell shortly about it. game is actually great, the story is catching and interesting. i got some bug in a game, but i completed it without a problem, just some funny bugs, i also was waiting for the game for about 7 years. i dont have good pc to play on ultras so i played on 768p 30 fps on very low so i didnt care about graphics on on slow hard drive and i enjoyed the game, really. the choices and amount of ending and side quest make game feel very good. its got bad optimisation and bug. but do you remember witcher 3 on launch? people tried to make a great game and that people are  on it makes me sad. turn the graphics down and enjoy."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"after i have been  w the ps4 copy of the game, i hope i will get the refund, i bought a pc one and...... the save file corruption glitch make me stop to continuing to play the game and i am very disappointed.... and the response from cpr is just a might fix the problem.... i was hoping to play this game during the holidays and now i just need to wait for the patch.... unbelievable .. my patience is over.....i don't understand all those 10 the people keeping rating.... wtf"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"probably one of the best rpg shooters, if you're a mature gamer and appreciate story and dialogue then this game is for you. if you're a streamer, kid, gta v fan who doesn't care to keep track of names, stories or other things, then this game isn't for you. you don't play a game that was in development for 8 years because the gta type of gameplay isn't what you expect, you play a game 8 years in development because of the story. phenomenal. when one of your characters is going through an emotional breakdown, you really feel it. bugs? yes, plenty, but again the storyline and missions completely overshadow it. i did not set any expectations for this game and i'm happy with my purchase."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i've found two serios problems 1 .as in the witcher 3, there is bad connection between the plot chapters. so it's hard to start another storyline. 2. the world is plastic. in addition to graphics, there is no sense of the future. for example why can't cars reach the parking lot by themselves? they can do it now. why can't i set the autopilot while i'm driving? at this time, i could shoot back. some technical parts are also plastic. especially the management of machines but you don't notice it because everything else is wonderful. i've played 40hourse and hadn't go far from prologue."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"te lo venden como si fuese un mundo libre, pero es un mundo libre lleno de bugs , una de las peores fsicas que he visto en un videojuego, la historia no es mala pero a diferencia de otros mundos libres este no da para nada, una decepcin total."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"this is not a role playing game. choices with no consequences. lifepaths are meaningless. no faction system like new vegas. there's the illusion of choices, but it crumbles on a second playthrought, and it's not what was advertized."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,this game is really good but bugs break it a bit but i still had fun with it. but wtf i don't understand you guys cd projekt red was delaying it because it wasn't finished! you wanted it to be released even if it wasn't finished! now they released it because you wanted and what do you expected from an unfinished game. next time be more patient and wait for the game to be finished than scream for it to be released. you did it to yourself.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i game it this score as there is no way to give it 8.5 yes there are some bugs but the amount are far far less than most ea, ubisoft, bethesda and a few others.. hell ea and bethesda release games that arn't even finished and they crash and burn. this game is fully complete but i feel they were pushed to release it by the hype and corpo greed.. i think they needed a couple more months to get it near perfect.. it was a given that the older consoles would suffer the most and sony and it's greed are now running away.. that pile of  tlou 2 is a joke and so below this game. when the patches are done this will be even better than it is now.. now it is breath taking and so deep and fun.. you really do get immersed in it. of the game itself i do have a couple of issues.. what does break immersion is 1 the romances are excellent, the characters are so deep, that is true of all the main characters. but the love interests very much. but once the romance story is complete they become like normal npc's.. they really need to fix this and soon.. 2 you get a place at the nomads camp.. i have not found a way in yet. judy gives you her keys but you cant use the place like your own even though she says you can. this needs fixing,, i would move in with her or panam judy is lesbian and panam is hetro but so far you can only use your own place. 3 cars.. i know some can do 1st person driving fine,, the rest 3rd person i am 3rd person but still they blow up to easy. even with all this,, if you play games by those mentioned, you would say that this game was complete and working fine. those who rate this low are just stupid and probably haters.. there is no way on gods green earth that this is below a 7 on anything other than a low level xbox 1 and ps 4. so many have completed the game,, and i mean sooo many and sooo many love it.. all the 0 and 1's are bots and haters and should be cleared as it clearly is not a game to be rated so low.. so,, back into night city chooms pc just above the mid range stated in the requirements."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"a good game, which could have been perfect. the immersion is incredible, the romances superb, the storytelling is very pleasant. do not take it for a gta like but as an rpg with a very immersive frame. lots of bugs fixed, don't listen to haters, test it and make up your own mind!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"even discounting the biblical level of bugs on display here, the game seems more like a tech demo than anything else. it's obvious that the team struggled to find the fun here. boring gameplay, boring characters, boring story. give it a miss."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"a good game, an openworld adventure shooter with soft rpg qualities. not as imersive and refined as it was promised. i think after several patches and dlcs should achieve what is promised. this is what happens when money is more important than the product."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i have a high end pc so the game runs fine with all the settings cranked up. and, i waited for a patch so i did not see any gamebreaking bugs. are there bugs? sure. crashes? one hard one so far. but, nothing i can't live with. but, even with everything working as intended, it's just not a great game. the story is meh the main character has a definite personality and i do not like it really does not feel like an rpg in that regard. lookswise, sure, there are lots of reflections, neon lights, and what not, but it does not look amazing even with all settings turned up to eleven. there is still occasional texture popin on stuff i'm looking straight at and it takes seconds to happen. honestly, gta5 on the ps3 looked better than this in most openworld scenes. there are a ton of side activities that are not all that interesting and they really make me want to go in guns blazing because, though i prefer the stealthhack game play, there are too many of these minilevels and they're not clearly marked as in, i'll wonder into a gun fight by accident and have to just kill everyone with a shotgun. that, combined with the gunplay being just ok does not make me want to participate. another point about combat. its too easy on normal and everyones a bullet sponge on hard. definitely, the cheap mmorpg approach in that the ai is garbage and difficulty is set with health bars. ideally, the behaviors would change based on difficulty. im sorry, a headshot is a headshot, having to upgrade a gun to make it a kill is immersion breaking. the brain dances are a neat idea but they're, so far, the buggiest part of the experience points of interest not being cleared, for instance can't say more without spoilers. add to that npcs walking through doors, duplicate civilians spawning, car ai and driving, honestly being terrible, and its not a good or memorable experience. should have focused more on the core game rather than filling it with throwaway side experience and eye candy. there is so much wrong besides the bugs that i would not recommend anyone buy this game unless it is on deep deep sale and there is absolutely nothing else to play."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"this game is meaningless,first of all, this game was just taken and moved without reason, seriously, just sawed the budget and just said that they were moving the game. second,did you see the woman in the trailer? do you know why it's not there? yes, because this is a real model and of course, it is better to pay the model and throw out at least a small part of the budget instead of making a new location for this money. third, again, everyone is licking everyone's ass, especially the participants of the third wave of feminism and transvestites. and because of this production in the game, we have a bunch of bugs, glitches, badly drawn characters that were not disclosed, stealth type and  do what you want, these dolls are deaf and blind."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"for me the game is rly good. not perfect but good enough. you know  there are no games without bugs nowadays. especially short after release. i wonder why everyone comparing i.e. rdr2 to cyberpunk where ppl says that rdr has better graphics, less bugs, better optimization but skips the fact that the game gets updates for a 1 year now, for first week game was unplayable because of crashing on start screen, lots of bugs where you couldnt progress in story because of constant crashes or stupid npcs behavior... why nobody remember that? the witcher 3 also got a lot of updates in first six months because game was hardly playable... now its one of the best games. why nobody remembers that? and comparing gta v which is actionsandbox game where mechanic plays much more role than story to cyberpunk which is rpg game where storymechanics is kinda fun for me. especially where everyone compare that games like every mechanic of gta is better than cp. why nobody made 11 comparision showing pros and cons of both games, especially when some mechanics are much better made in cp than in gta like blood spread, npc reaction when you take out a gun, more advanced destruction of the indoor environment and a lot of more. i'm not defending cdpr. i'm aware that they fd up a lot of things like releasing the game on old generation consoles without testing but let me say it again  there are no games without bugs nowadays shortly after release ."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"cyberpunk 2077  indubbiamente un gioco che supera quelli che erano gli standard del videogame toccando su next gen una vetta davvero irraggiungibile per molti altri titoli vagamente simili , se pur con qualche errore sopra tutto su old gen , ma basandoci su quello che  il gioco e non su quello che dovrebbe essere non si puo dire che non sia un gioco stupendo , scritto molto bene e con una quantit di dettagli enorme , anche se mi aspettavo un gioco massivo come the witcher 3 che ci ho messo un mese abbondante per finire la storia principale e alcune sotto trame , ma quando in 6 giorni sono riuscito a finire cyberpunk devo ammettere che un p mi e dispiaciuto, per quanto la trama e davvero bella avrei apprezzato piu diversita tra le varie scelte iniziali, effettivamente street kids, corporate o nomad hanno di differente solo alcune possibilit di dialogo , mentre io mi aspettavo che a seconda della scelta fatta il finale sarebbe stato diverso poich il modo in cui lo si raggiunge era diverso , come corporate mi immaginavo incarichi un po piu governativi , volevo scalare la piramide sociale dall interno , come nomad sarebbe stato bello passare del tempo nelle badlands magari col proprio clan e successivamente ad un attacco ci spostavamo all interno di night city , invece no il gioco e uno , le missioni sono quelle e a prescindere da corpo , nomad o street kid le missioni sono le stesse cambia il modo in cui le si affronta ma non perch vengono influenzate dalla scelta della fazione ma solo dalla scelta dei dialoghi , inoltre il gioco e possibile finirlo in modalit difficile solo mettendo al posto giusto qualche punto , io ad esempio ho sciolto il boss finale che non spoilero anche se e abbastanza palese solo bustando danni critici probabilita di critico e danni pistole, inoltre le varie modalit di difficolt modificano unicamente i danni che si arrecano e che si ricevono , havrei preferito qualcosa tipo aumento della qualit del loot o una maggiore diversit tra i nemici che tutto sommato sono sempre quelli , i tiger claws i maelstrom oltre a piccoli dettagli estetici come tatuaggi o giacche avrei preferito piu diversit tra i nemici e sopratutto pi boss fight , comunque devo basarmi su quello che e e non su quello che sarebbe stato meglio fosse , in sintesi bel gioco scritto molto bene con meno contenuti di quelli che mi aspettavo ok ma quelli che ci sono ci stanno , modificherei il combact sistem corpo a corpo e aggiungerei dei contenuti che spingano alla rigiocabilit ho finito il gioco e non ho stimoli per rinizaiarlo da capo solo per vedere dei differenti finali anche perch il gioco quasi a fine game te lo dice che e un punto di non ritorno quindii si finisce con usare solo un  sopratutto se come me si a passato ore a terminare sottotrame e a esplorare , piccolo punto , night city e indubbiamente bellissima ma purtroppo la natura gdr del gioco porta a fregarsene di molti negozi tipo bar o ristoranti rendendoli inutili per colpa del loot e in generale non ce questab grande diversita tra gli effetti del cibo , inoltre gli alcolici danno solo malus non come su follout che oltre a un malus dava un bonus alla forza"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"amazing game, amazing experience thank you cd projekt red for this amazing game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"cyberpunk 2077 could have been not only goty but also game of the decade. i can see so much potential in it, so many fresh ideas and best of all  plentiful of opportunities. however, there must have been enormous turbulance behind the curtains of cdpr that are yet to be uncovered in the years to come. and that's why it is what it is today. back to the point. overall, i liked the game and i played it on pc. i wasn't bothered that much by the bugs, flawed textures and overly simplified ai. these are fixable and had cdpr taken their time with that instead of releasing the game in this state, the game would have been received better. i wouldn't have minded to wait as much as needed. anyway, here is what i didn't appreciate about the game 1. cutdown content and features, some of which promised in the first place. 2. little variety when it comes to clothes, weapons and cars. 3. very little weapon and clothing customization. 4. extremely poor crafting system, minimal reward when upgrading and visual improvement when you up your equipment. this is a big one for me. it costs a lot to improve yet it's completely unnecessary. i managed to beat the game with subpar items. the game gives no incentive to go for crafting and that's critical! 5. cyberwear is another huge disappointment. costs  yet the impact on the gameplay is soso. 6. skills and attributes mechanic has an interesting foundation but poorly executed from a game design standpoint. most of the options are redundant and have minor reflection on the gameplay. this is another critical error because the player doesn't have to be considered when building up their character. i beat the game at level 30 with over 15 skill and 8 attribute points left hanging because i was paving my way through enemies effortlessly. 7. main storyline is cool but the fact that it so incredibly easy to trick and beat such an advanced corporation is offputting. arasaka stands for the prime hightech corpo, which is supposed to have military equipment and defenses that are supposed to require the player to invest all of his points, skills and resources in order to manage to keep it through until the end. well, that's not the case. again, i was having a subpar equipment, messy skillattribute build and i'm no hardcore fps gamer yet this felt very unchallenging. 7.1 adam smasher, the final boss of the game was just as easy as an ordinary cyberphycho just with more defense and health. big letdown on this one. 8. side quests were engaging but they were not even remotely close to the charm of what the witcher 3 had to offer in terms of storywriting and game design. they feel like just another job to do for the eddies. 9. undeveloped fx andor nonexistent outcomes when you damage vehicles. for example, you can't break enemies's tires. the vehicles get damaged in a random and nonlogical fashion, which makes the player pay less attention to his driving or care about his carbike. moreover, the damage gets repaired for free and again randomly, which makes no sense. i didn't plan to write this long but i do care about cyberpunk 2077 and i have nothing more but willigness to encourage and support cdpr to work and expand on this universe. however, with such big ambitions come big responsibilities, therefore very high expectations. in that regard, take your time, learn from your own experience, player suggestions and mistakes. i hope if there will be a new cyberpunk, it will really be a gamechanging next generation game. it's got the foundation, now it's just time to build upon it and refine what's already been made. real score 6.5 game played on normal hardness"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"cool game, just played 14 hours, story is not bad, also good, massive content avaliable, gameplay on level, perfect realization of city, awesome soundtracks, cool charactersnot all, but so on. about negative side of the game a bit terrible optimization, some buggs and so funny situations with npc's."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,don't get me wrong my pc is strong enough to handle this game but this game just . there's no meaning in the answers you give to the npc's. you can't do anything in night city except just some lame side missions. the lag is so annoying that i thought it was a joke

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"good game, fun to play. did not live up to the hype of its marketing campaign, has some major flaws that need to be ironed out. the main story was interesting, good characters and side quests, gameplay decent except for the driving which is horrible. nothing that sticks out or unique though. the world was immersive on a surface level, but when you stop and watch characters walk through solid surfaces and levitating it doesn't help create an immersive environment. best radio stations in a game since san andreas. always good to have a radio station playing hard techno while trying to turn a corner without fishtailing. i had a few issues, i restarted the game 45 times to get rid of bugs, though i was running on lowest graphics settings because my graphics card is outdated. lots of glitches though. a decent game to spend 4050 hours to complete the story, side quests fun but mostly generic rpg quests. hoping there will be some major updates becuase they are needed for a full experience driving is terrible. if considering buying this game, wait until it goes on sale or players comment on changes made when updates and patches are released, there is little value for paying full price in the state it is in currently."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"this game is getting so much  its crazy. when i showed it to a couple of friends from playing it on stadia they were pretty impressed by it. they were surprised this was the same game they were hearing all this youtubers complain about. this game is good, easy 8.5 to 9 for me. 70 hours in, only two crashes via stadia. voice acting is good, the artwork is gorgeous. the ai needs to improve. that is the biggest problem for me. clothing is cool, i look forward to a patch to change my hair style and look, but changing my cyber gear allowed for different experiences. high jump changed my play style. playing as a female v was a ton of fun, the voice actress was pretty awesome. the story was good, not a save the world but save yourself story. i felt like a part of the city. i am impressed with all the hard work developers put into this. they definitely messed up with releasing an unfinished ps4 and xbox one edition and deserve the criticism they are getting for releasing those versions in a poor state, but on stadia this game is a charm. i love night city, got most of the cars, done a lot of side missions and the relations you can build with characters like panam or lucy are great. i should give it a 10 because of so many people giving it a zero without even playing it, but wont give it a fake score. it has some problems but nothing major on stadia, and should be fixed by dlc and patches in the future. it has been a fun 70 hours and counting. would live in night city over gta online and red dead online if it adds a multiplayer online world in the future. it would be nice to get a new apartment. great work on this game, but you should have waited to patch the problems or release it with people knowing is on early access to avoid this pr mess. reminds me of no man sky. i love that game too, and how hello games has added more and more amazing features since release. two very ambitious projects that simply needed more time and released a bit too early. can easily see this becoming the next most improved game. i feel a lot of the criticism comes from people that don't appreciate how hard it is to build something this extensive. keep up the good work with , the witcher, and cyberpunk!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"cyberpunk 2077 is an overhype game that flops so hard dues to it's own marketing bs. as an open world game, the game doesn't have any fundamental of being open world game due to it's lack of focus on the npc ai behavior, interaction and the world environment. as an rpg game, the game lacks of rpg element. the perk system and attribute doesn't influence heavily on how player play the game. it's either reveal background story, access a door, hack an access point or give a passive buff for you in combat. neither of it change the outcomes of the story and behavior of the player. all you need is gun and bullet because they are everywhere and free. to be fair, cyberpunk 2077 has a decent world, graphic, lightning that creates a unique life and atmosphere for night city. the story and characters are actually decent and good. unfortunately, that's it. as an open world game, ai and world interaction are very crucial. however, the game doesn't even has a proper ai behavior, as they promoted ''1000 of ai daily routines''. they can't even proper react to player action. let's not talk about there is no subway system and flying transportation in this game. you can't interact with the world itself is a shame as the dev labelled it as open world game. to summarize this, all the thing in the world is just a decoration for the world. next, poor graphic on the minor detail. end of 2020 and the dev decide to deliver us a low poly steak and paper french fries. looks at those burger. how can a player unseen it when some missions require you to meet at a restaurant. those pop in 2d vehicle always despawn on near and spawn at distant is ridiculous. to summarize it, to promote rtx on major detail and totally ignore the minor detail. conclusion, the game is a rushed and unfinished game that just want to use keanu reeves as a bait to hook players to buy it. if you really like it, is good for you. but bear in mind, you are the reason why dev doesn't care about the game quality but profit. i honestly wish that cdpr promote it as a linear storytelling action game instead of open world rpg game, because it failed as it is... even worse than watch dogs as they are too similar if you comparing them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"story telling is amazing, shooting mechanics and character development is well executed. the game runs smoothly on xbox one. a couple of visual bugs encountered during gameplay, however its nothing that would ruin immersion or won't let you complete a quest. the city design is amazing, characters are interesting, the universe is well executed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"i'm tired of this companies selling unfinished products. bugs, glitches, lack of core elements to any rpg, openworld game, misleading and over hyped advertising. i'm not saying you can't enjoy the game at its current state but, imagine ordering a burger and getting only the buns and a slice o tomato, they may be one of the best you've ever tasted story, artwork but where's the patty, the lettuce, the ! pickle? i paid for this so i expect nothing less than the full experience and all i got was wasted potential, i have no doubt they want to make a franchise out of this so they will eventually fix it but it's just frustrating seeing how this behavior is becoming the norm, specially from a company that states to leave greed to others. if i preorder a game ever again, which i highly doubt after this fiasco, cd projekt red will permanently remain in my list of developers not to do so. sorry for bad english"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"so, i had one crash, and two minor side jobs i couldn't finish. the rest of the time i was driving around night city kicking ass and upgrading v's abilities finishing the main quest. i could stealthy quickhack kill the nastiest enemies or wipe them with my looted and upgraded assault rifle, fking awesome smart smg rocket launcher, and kick ass rapid fire shotty. also if you wanted an rpg, by design, you don't want an action video game. this game is not a strict rpg, but it's deep enough for a video game and there are enough customizations that make a difference in the game for it not to be totally pointless. it could be a bit deeper, but then again i wasted 10 lifetimes crafting, looting and stash management in the division 1 and 2, and found in the end it was more like another day job than a fun game so i was releived i could customize v enough to make it suit my play style, without actually investing in a side jobs worth of effort. i completed act 2 in three ways i wanted to end the game and was totally satified. i played it on hard to make it a challenge and although the ai could be a bit smarter, it was hard enough to be fun. the only con is that the popup over powered police are stupid  at at least should engage with the baddies if they are shooting up the street too. this should be fixed in a future patch i'm sure. anyways, all you low scorers either bought the wrong game, don't like cyberpunk, or just part of the whiny meme driven herd stupidity that currently infects humanity. this game is not only great, it's the start of an awesome franchise  most of you are comparing with existing and mature franchises  so if you like those play those  but this is just the beginning of cp2077. oh and the soundtrack rocks especially the rtjs tune."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-21,"simply amazing. actual and great rpg mechanics, awesome graphics, well developed and seamless combat mechanics... everything is in here. the game specification book is one of the fullest ever seen, but even knowing this, the game is really smooth and cleverly mixes genres to deliver a well rounded cultural product, because yes, the core of the game is still the story. there is an actual ideological display that stages multiple relevant points of view about cybernetics and many other things. this is some great open world coherence, and every single other thing is at least acceptable in the game, even the remaining glitches that are, and have always been a part of the bitter sweet love that we all have for cdpr. let's not let such a great game be insulted by those who play it on toasters. it's not cdpr's fault if sony and microsoft's recent hardware release that are supposed to be state of the art for the next 7 years, btw are not capable of running the first big game to be released right afterward. shame on them, and glory to cdpr."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i play it on pc but my girlfriend is playing the ps4 version on the ps5... i think there is enough said about the console version  it is garbage. on the pc it is way better, but it also feels not finished. there are weird glitches and bad textures. all in all  the technical side is something you can patch, and they are patching already. but what you cant patch that easy is the trust from a loyal gamerbase. coming from the witcher we all expected much more in terms of quality of the game but also in terms of communication. the player feels betrayed, and this is the worst thing you can do. i will double and tripple check before i buy the next game of cd project red."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"the game is really awesome, even bugs are not so noisy, if you like storyline. 1010 and anyway there will be more more bug fix, so if you want bugfree version wait 12 month."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this game had an amazing potential but you had to ruin it with all the extreme feminism political nonsense. i am all up for rights of our females counterparts but when you make the game a political movement, you miss out on the important things like fixing the insane amount of bugs they are issuing refunds for. its like producers don't care about the game anymore but only about amount of  they can please. i wont be surprised if these  wish to rewrite actual history now and say george washington was a female... why not, we need to fill a quota here!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"if you separate the company and everything we know about it now from the game, this game looks and feels awesome. optimization could be better but this part was expected. i caught some minor bugs but looks like i'm lucky enough to didn't have game braking problems."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i made these acount only, to rate these gameon 10. its briliant game, plot is my favourite from all games i have ever played. i have 40 h in c77 already and i had something like 15 glithes? 2 was something that litle bit ruined my experienc from game but rest was nothing like that. knowing cdp they will fix it in like half a year anyway. music is fantastic. shooting is nice. hacking is awsome. i haven't play lot of racing game's so my opinion about cars isn't very important but i enyoed it as well. the only thing that disapoint me was hero editor. i thought it will be biger. rest of these game is awsome. so if you are player that, like plot and good writed haracters, its game for you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"cyberpunk is basically what i expected. lets start with the good thing. the core of the game the story is well crafted for almost every part of the game even the side quest. every side quest has always some form of story attached and this is whats makes the game interesting. i really like the stealth mechanics and most game mechanics really well. it is clearly a 910 game in general. now to address some of the bad stuff. bugs  there are bugs but nothing more then expected. both my pc and xbox play the game fine. most common issues are more minor visual thinks like thinks can float and a very few times items can detach from an animation  but thats mostly rare all in all on both platforms i had far less issues then what the witcher 3 had on release. i actually think that most people complaining about bugs are totally over reacting and not really equaly fair to the game in anyway when i see what they complain about. everyone i know has basically same minor issues like me and nothing major. other games like horizon zero dawn, death stranding watch dogs legions etc where way more broken in every single way on release then cyberpunk so i dont understand what people even complain so much about. now there are some legit complains though from me . the life path choices at the start give a very short introduction only that will confuse people. there are also allot of systems and menu items  finding stuff and how it works is hard and take a whole playthrough before you even understand how most systems in the game work. this leads you to mess up stuff or miss stuff and not understanding allot of stuff. on top of that starting life path are way to short.. you get kicked right into some action and the are right away almost at the junction point where all life path meet in the start. this is really disapointing for me. same with the endings a bit .. they are really different but the core ending basically feels still the same. the game also is not able because its rushing the story it seems to attach me to the characters as well as witcher 3 did where i still today cry at some points... i never did feel the same attachements to the cyberpunk characters . the story is good and well done but i just cant get that attached because its a bit to much rushed after people complaining that witcher 3 was to long. the game has bigger issues like police reactions are done really bad and need rework but all in all the core game is still a very good game. with all the bugs i would give it a 810 but since they soon for sure get fixed i give the game a 910 because all in all even with its issues and complains it is still a very good game that has big replay value and is clearly worth my time and money"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,it's not perfect but i'm down to spend 100 hours just to play this beautiful game

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"bad worldbuilding, linear quests, and hundreds of similar quests on the map. i expected more, at least a consistent quest line?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"visually stunning with good, not great character building from the start. yes, cyberpunk 2077 is hampered by far too many bugs to be the immersive game it attempts to be at launch. while i'm confident that these bugs will be addressed over time, it's difficult to try to fully dive in or even justify paying the 60 tag it comes along with while waiting for these bugs to be fixed. for those who have yet to buy the game, or have the patience to wait until february when the developer says most next to all bugs will be addressed, i would say wait. cyberpunk 2077 clearly has the makings of a fantastic game. if you, like me, waited 8 years to play then a few more months wont hurt... too badly."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,i enjoy it. i avoided the hype train though. it's a fun and reasonably sound and decent game. much of the criticism i suppose is valid but i think most folks are lashing out out of emotion over considering the quality of the game on this platform. i have encounter very few bugs and those that i have were easy to circumvent. it's not as polished as i might like but it is a beautiful open world. i do wish you could go into more of the buildings. but the game hasn't been a bad experience and i've already enjoyed 71 hours of gameplay quite nicely.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,you guys are so . what do you think
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"all the performance drama aside, after playing 25h, mostly doing side quests i must say that i've never seen such amount of a small details in any other a game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,perfect game with perfect story without bugs. on my pc ryzen 5 26003.4 gtx1650 super ram 16gb3000 average fps 43.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i finished the game. took me around 35 hours with some side quests done but not all. probably could finish all the rest in 20 additional hours or so. i'm going to make it short until the very end, there are no choices that matter. only your decisions in the final mission really make a difference... for nothing, because you can't remain in the world of cyberpunk postending. this lack of continuity, in which you can't remain in this game after all is done and waiting for future content while you do side quests and additional content, is what bothers me most. the game will force you to return to a save state previous to the final mission. you can't see how the world of cyberpunk lives on after your story, or should i say, the story of johnny silverhand? because most of the time it feels like they are forced to give him more protagonism since he is keanu reeves. being firstperson only even strengthens this feeling that you are just there watching how things happen in front of you, without much to do there. there is only 1 light machine gun and 1 heavy machine gun in the game. you can't customize your cybernetic implants and see them, because you never see your character. i think the development of this game started to go downhill the moment they decided to make it an fps. most of the time it does not feel like an actual rpg, and you feel like you're just playing some sort of futuristic firstperson gta. the problem with this game is that many of the things that they kept promising over the years are just not there. and as a consequence, the players feel scammed. you can't upgrade or customize your cars, or your house, most of the nicest vehicles in the game, you can't have them. some of them, you can't even drive them. 90 of the doors are locked and there is no way to unlock them. not even with the tech skill that is supposed to do exactly that. i came to realize that the content is just not there, so the game can't show you what's inside. when you see all those amazing flying vehicles, you start to think that later in the game, you will be flying them in this socalled vertical city. but nope. you never pilot or have anything of the sort in your possession. in the end, you can't promise so much and give so little. and the little you give, so buggy. i am left disappointed because it lacks continuity and that's not what gamers expect today. they created a 2012 game in 2020, so i can't stop thinking maybe cdpr was never the right developer for this game. other studios could probably do better."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"incredible photorealistic graphics, especially with reshade it is above raytracing, along with content behind every corner, convincing story and stunning gameplay. thank you for making this game we can see all the love that went into it, this is a masterpiece for pc! the game never yet stopped me in solving quests my way, i have only yet seen that in original deus ex and exploration gets very interesting as level design is off the charts. there are unique items along with legendary craftable options, and combat feels thrilling along with stealth and hacking. the world is simply put incredible, it varies and you can see so many interesting things, might just walk or drive down the street and have fun without even interacting with the world. so many little things added that spice up the game, and hopefully more will come. thank you cdpr developers. there are tons of reviews here written with unreasonable anger by console users, people who never played the game, and people who can not play it since it requires strongexpensive computers and consoles and maybe people who had imagined the game would have even more features. irony is, i never asked for the game to be rushed, and those same people who were part of the hype are now part of the drama. have fun gaming guys and have a great time durring holidays"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,this is complicated to review. underneath this somewhat disastrous launch is a truly remarkable game. its unfortunate that they completely mislead consumers with last gen performance but im confident cdpr will fix it in due time.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"great game. seriously. even if potentially it can be greater and deeper netrunning mechanics, braindances, more character choise in cp2020 it is still wonderfull rpg."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"cyberpunk is an unremarkable, cynical, poorly written, obnoxious game. even without all the bugs, it fails on all counts. the shooting is not good, the game design is tedious, the world is dirty and ugly, and the body horror is exhausting. the music is truly truly awful. it claims to be an rpg but provides no classes, few customization options, and doesn't even let you pick a name. deus ex is a much better rpg, any of them. the character creator is also gimmicky, and is far worse than many older games even. the world building is idiotic. i find myself rolling my eyes fairly regularly. also, apparently in the future everyone looks like gigantic jackwagon. not a good game. admittedly, i had very little good will going into this given the games edgelord marketing, a context that makes the whole bladerunner edgerunner ripoff even more ridiculous and i have to say it is somewhat vindicating to watch cdpr fail so spectacularly. they named one of the first characters you meet pepe. bite me. i played this on a beefy computer. i am significantly above recommended specs. even with that the game is profoundly broken. it just looks awful. do not spend money on this, do not encourage cdpr. they need to be put in timeout for squirting out this demonseed. it's not the worst game of all time, but taken as a whole, it is awful. play something else. it is repulsive and idiotic. as i write this, jackie's chopstick has just frozen in mid air."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"overhyped, overmarketing, overheated, it is the biggest disappointment of the year, what a shame after perfect witcher3. money is not everything. it's not even about bugs, it's about hostility to players, incomprehensible intentions, tragic character movements and much more ... it's a waste of time. of course there are some great elements like the 3d map but this is a game, it should be fun to play, and it isn't. when i read some 1010 ratings, i wonder if we played the same game ... or someone is buying marketing entries ... it's impossible that opinions diverge so much ... this score is paid score. cdpr stop doing this one time fake score  !..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,it's got bugs but for me the game itself far outweighs the issues. i'm having a blast.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,cyberbug 76 that's all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this game is crap!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i like. nice game and good storyline and quest's. there are bugs, but not very intrusive. the players are too demanding now. 10 because someone puts 0."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,i know people are different and everyone has their own taste. i personally only like good games. so i obviously didn't like cyberpunk 2077.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"the bugs are mostly minor, akin to w3's roach freaking out, but the game itself is great. don't buy into the outrage, don't miss out on it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,i did not like this game. it had gamebreaking bugs and very empty open world. meh.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,".    ,    ,     ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"pros nightcity cannot be underestimated as a living breathing character in the game. graphics are inspiring the character models are the best i've ever seen. characters and dialogue is great gunplay is fantastic. side quests can be amazing. cons npcs are not believable, not even close. story isn't that good. combat ai is not great. rpg elements are not deep or meaningful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"every time you play this game and some extreme bug ruins the gameplay, every time you see npc's vanishing into thin air, every time there's absolutely nothing to do in this empty openworld, just remember, they took 8 years to make this game and promoted it as next generation of open world games. just saying."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"so many bugs, glitches. those bugs will not let you play without stress. but when i saw my own ending, i realized how much i was immersed in my characters and shocked by the fact i am not gonna able to get the same emotions again. the mood, sound and pleasure of shooting something. for me, the best game ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"grand theft auto iv 2008, grand theft auto v 2013 and watchdogs 2014 are better and more complex openworld games than cyberpunk2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"let's be honest, the launch of this game was a disaster. i've had it since day 1 but decided to wait for a few patches. so far i absolutely love it. edit i finished the game so my final rating is... amazing graphics 1010  free epileptic seizures so 1110 the environment  cyberpunk feel 1010 nventory and skills system  1010 story  i don't really like the endings so 610 overall functionality bugs  510"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"no, watchdogs is not fair comparison. watchdogs is way, way better. npc's in watchdogs are lightyears ahead compared to cyberpunk2077. openworld in general is built better in watchdogs. you can actually shoot car tires out in watchdogs, how about that. you can't do that in cyberpunk2077. watchdogs obviously is weaker game than gta v, because gta v is masterfully made video game, but even then watchdogs is still solid hacking themed openworld game. cyberpunk can't get even close to watchdogs level."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i am playing on stadia. i do think how you play makes all the difference as i have only encountered one small bug and the game looks and plays amazingly. this isn't bow or a game that is going to revolutionize the industry, but it is an awesome game with a great story. the amount of time and detail put into the game is phenomenal. if you have reasonable expectations and play on stadia or a highend pc, you will love it!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,lies like this should never be tolerated. i'm hoping for internet historian's honest video about what happened and not some defending video.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this game is alright in a popcorn kind of way. its enticing and tasty in ways but ultimately a hollow experience that leaves you tossing the bag when the movie is over. all the mechanics are shallow and buggy. the best thing the game does is if you unfocus your eyes you can feel immersed in the world. its not an rpg but it can feel like it for a bit. its like an ai, only sophisticated enough to convince you its real for brief periods."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"it claimed to be the next generation of open world games, bigger, more complex and deeply engaging. the truth? a shallow, broken world that even when it works feel's empty. it sure looks good sometimes if you have a 800 video card other than that it is just pure marketing. gta v that came out in 2013 is more elaborated in any aspect you can comparre. in fact watch dogs should be a more fair comparison. even when the game shines following the main narrative it so surrounded with bugs and glitches that will take the immersion away in a blink. stay away and don't listen do cd projekt red, they proved to be the biggests crooks in the industry."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,amazin story and music and great graphics have encountered little bit of bugs till now
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,poorly made amateurish game. only people who would give this 1010 are either politically motivated or haven't played any aaa open world games of past 15 years.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,here's honest question to people who are defending this 60 dollar earlyaccess game with fake 1010's. why are you doing this? would like that other companies copypaste same idea in future? this is something that needs to be called out not defended.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,game plays perfectly on my xbox one base model with the new update only and run smooth on my laptop core i5 gtx 1060
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"it's difficult to say that it's mediocre open world game, because then it should have at least decent npc's. right now it's literally day of the dead. npc's walk into you, they vanish into thin air, etc. awful programming."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"let me introduce you worst aaa video game of 2020, taking into consideration development time, budget, missing content and extreme amount of bugs and performance issues, cyberpunk 2077 is worst aaa video games of 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,goty game on pc love it i'm using a gtx 1080 not ti few bugs but nothing serious id needs some fixes but till now have 63h on it and still love it recommend it on pc 100 not consoles
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"yeah, this game is buggy and didnt launch in a state that many unrealistically expected. however the core gameplay, side quests, main quest line, and overall ambiance of the world is engaging and interesting, encouraging people to explore various points of interest for what they may contain. even on older consoles the game is very much playable and enjoyable although is a better experience on pc or next generation consoles, many people are unfairly reviewing the game based on the game before many of the various patches that have been released. however if sensitive to bugs this game is not currently your cup of tea, however in several months after various patches i believe most would enjoy the game and all its content."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this game has nothing that has not been done before, but it's ultimate downgrade in terms of open world compared to any aaa open world game past 10 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i understand that many players are experiencing issues with this game.. but everyone is to blame for it from devs, to gamers being absolute toddlers about delays and sending threats, management, and marketing. to some it is a buggy mess. in my case, this game is 95 perfectly playable without any crashes. the story is strong and immersive. i have enjoyed and memorized a ton of the side characters and their stories. i love the music, gun play is not the greatest but not exactly meant to be flashy. cdpr is doing their best to fix the game for everyone. patience created this issue. cp2077 could have been delayed 4 more times and would have been worth it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"after the long wait, it's here, not 100 bug free but nothing is. this is a fantastic game just wait"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"so basically only reason why all professional reviews gave it 1010 or 100100 was because it's first game that includes transgender people? ps i have absolutely nothing against transgender people, but giving game 1010 just because it includes them is bs . these reviewers don't care about actual video games, openworld or even story, bugs, bad ai and so on. all they want is politics. last of us part 2 is perfect example of that. professionally made game that had one of the worst stories, but this awful story fitted their narrative so they gave it 1010. they liked the fact that joel died. they liked that you can play as abby. that's all they want. wonder woman movies are only ones that are doing powerful female characters right, maybe tomb raider games and remedy's control 2019 too. that's it. all these reviewers think is that you must kill popular male characters, so female character can shine. this is wrong on so many levels. these people will never understand how stupid they are. thankfully there are also ones who are doing it right, so thank god for that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"firstly it is s beautiful looking game. just for a few reasons it isn't pulling me in like i had hoped all these years for. i do not like the fact there is no 3rd person view while playing unless you are in a car. i thought i could get used to it but i can't. the driving seems off. maybe it's the years of playing gta5, but the driving in my opinion seemed unnatural. the camera for the cars swing around s so fast too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"2021 will be amazing year! thank god this trash cyberpunk 2077 has been finally released, so people don't need to read about it in every video game forum anymore. it will be forgotten in few months and thank god for that. because now people can finally focus on upcoming video games that actually matter like elden ring, hogwarts legacy, far cry 6, elder scrolls vi, resident evil 4 remake, gta 6 and so much more!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i love it, it does have a lot of bugs but it's a pretty awesome game with a good story. i love how much attention they gave to detail, everywhere you see there's something to look at. i played the pc version i have a rtx3080 and a 3900x i am able to play it on ultra rtx on, its pretty good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"apart from the botched base model lastgen console release, it's nowhere near as bad as everyone is making out. all the reduced or cut content? that was mentioned in press releases months before it came out  except for the stuff that was a oneoff mention of that'd be cool, we'll think about it i'd say 99 of the games problems are due to excessive hype from fanbois, expecting systems that where never promised, or assuming systems in game would rediculously indepth. it runs fine at 1440p on my 1080ti, no real crashes or game breaking bugs i've seen. it's been out less than 2 weeks and it just got its 2nd or 3rd patch  which is pretty on the ball for a company that just released a game 2 weeks before christmas."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"o jogo falha em trazer uma inovao com o enredo, mas no peca em trazer uma histria envolvente e cheia de reviravoltas. entretanto, o jogo  marcado por inmeras falhas tcnicas e mesmo depois de vrios adiantamentos ao decorrer do ano de 2020 o jogo veio tecnicamente incompleto."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"gamers in actual year 2077 will laugh their ass off, when they look back at video game history and see this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"excellent game, one of the best i have ever played. if it wasn't for the amount of bugs and glitches it wouldn't have been reviewed so poorly by others."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this game is biggest lie in gaming, ever. nothing works, half the promised things are missing. nudity is censored on every system. this game is a joke and was only made to make money. they managed to get over 8 million preorders. i bet at least 5 million of these were for base ps4. oh god."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"these 1010 best rpg ever bots are crazy. is nobody monitoring this thing? this game is so broken it was removed from playstation store and some people act like it's still best game ever. not true. hell no. these must be bots, because half of them make accounts so quickly they don't even notice they rate this game with 010 and say that it's best game ever. moderatos i'm begging you, do something. these are 100 lies. what, if someone actually believes them and buys the game? game doesn't work, half of the promised features are missing, npc's dont't work, police don't work, traffic don't work. nothing works in this game. stop these lies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"it's like vtmb, in meaning match bugs and glitches, but we love the game for atmosphere and story! yes, if you read and watch many cyberpunk products, then you see many connections with it, but it's what we want!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"mediocre. pretty, but no depth. the openworld is a joke. what is this  game? the npcs are the most basic i've seen since 1999. it's all skindeep with no substance. night city is braindead filled with meaningless activities. how is this the same people who made witcher 3? i'm just getting pissed now. cya."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i hate to bring up other companies, because each company should be looked separately, i get that. but even then i just can't help myself. ubisoft takes usually 3 years to make a game and their games range from average to good. now imagine, if ubisoft had 8 years for 1 game, what they could do. it's crazy. because they clearly have talented people working for them. they could do miracles with 8 years. i can't believe cdprojectred messed up so badly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"you give 0 out of 10 and you say that you like the game? do you even look at what score you give? can you be more obvious bot? by the way no negative reviews are not from people who wanted gta 5, negative reviews are from people who wanted next generation of open worlds as they promised in the trailer. but what we got is most amateur game in last 13 years. game has tons of bugs, but bugs are least of the problems, because these can be fixed. there's tons of stuff that can't be fixed. like boring, scripted npc's, traffic, police system, none of these work. they should remake half the game to make it decent and even then, open world in this game is boring. stop defending these lies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,i have never seen game like this. tragic premiere with tons of technical fails but... this storytelling is legendary. i dont care about these bugs... i just want to finish this game again! have fun guys

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"beautiful, addictive, amazing, vivid, brilliant storyline. masterpiece. yes the bugs are ... but i've seen bigger and more unforgivable in other titles aaa. this game doesn't deserve to be given less."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i spent over 75h with game. while playing, i encountered only 2 big bugs, but a quick reload successfully fixed them. story is the strongest point of cp77. it is addictive and the characters you meet are memorable. you start to care about them. shooting is fun and gives you a sense of satisfaction. the cars were very good to drive, i could feel power and weight. the main disadvantage is the map, which is too small. the choice of life path not only changes the first 1020 minutes of the game, it also adds additional dialogue options throughout the game, which significantly affects the course of tasks."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"just best game i ever played. make metacritic account to say this. play games, don't count the frames. especially on other people's devices"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"best game of the decade. in a time in which other studios produce nothing but ridiculously casual and dumb hamster wheel kingdoms of boredom, cyberpunk does everything right. first game in 35 years i personally gave a 100 of 100. everybody whining about this there's enough other trash out there for you to play. this game doesn't need a single detail to be changed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,the game is hot garbage even after the patch on even the best rigs due to a multitude of bugs that will actually prevent you from progressing. we should expect better from aaa titles.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i play cyberpunk 2077 for 50 hours in my pc, i have a i9 9900k 2080ti, and play rtx on and ultra and dls at performance average 6070 fps in 3440x1440, and of course it as bugs"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"disappointing. it is a game i wanted to like. everything before the release promised exactly what an openworld rpg should be. however, reality cannot be further from the truth. bugs aside, the game is just boring. it has potential, but it is let down by a linear storyline that doesn't play out as an exciting story, but rather as if someone added completely unnecessary steps to extend the gameplay. most main and side quests feel completely pointless  if you fastforward through the whole 2hourlong quest and get a onesentence summary of what happened, you wouldn't miss a thing. quests don't give you choices they don't influence your character you just go through a linear sequence of steps without much engagement or thinking  click here, go here, open this, bring it here. after 30 minutes of playing cyberpunk, i found myself fastforwarding thanks for adding that feature, btw through all dialogues  they are just meaningless, emotionless fluff added to the game to extend playtime. typical rpg stuff, such as crafting, dont add much to the game. instead, the game comes down to pointless wandering in an empty world without any meaning or purpose. it gets very repetitive after a few hours. there are beautiful scenes  i liked the designs of the tarot cards are the work of art  but the came itself doesnt live up to the hype or its potential."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,encountered a few bugs but ive only put in around 5 hours so far. not too bad. bugs are an annoyance though
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"1010 slightly buggy beginning launch aside most of these solveable with a reload, this was truly a memorable storyline, and awe inspiring experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"there's no denying the console release was poorly done, however i can't say the same for pc. i have been playing the game for the last two weeks with only a few bugs impeding my gameplay. the story may very well be one of the best i've experiencing in a video game, with the player options and side quests having a lasting impact on my choices. with that said, this is a true open world game, yes there are linear quests, but the chance to explore and experience the world is there, and what a beautiful world it is. the graphics are very good, at times breathtaking. the world is rendered with a quality very rarely seen in video games and it may be this fact that led to so many problems with the console editions. it's hard for me to believe anything but a midrange to high end pc could actually manage this game. the controls are good, sketchy at times, but no worse than other leaders in this genre, i.e. skyrim, fallout, and witcher, in fact they are better than witcher in almost every regard. the difficulty at normal seems, easy? that would be my only concern. it should have been very easy, easy, normal, and hard as the levels of difficulty. the only missions that stop me on normal difficulty are hard or very hard missions, and even then i've completed hard missions after some reloads. overall i would say this may be regarded as one of the best video games every released. is it a 10 now? no, will it be a ten in a year, i believe it absolutely will be. can you enjoy it on pc now? yes and yes. i recommend this on pc to all my friends. it's an amazing game that will only get better."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"amazing game, i'm really enjoying cyberpunk 2077 from the first mission to the last. masterpiece storyline and i hope so they will continue. i faced a few funny bugs during the game, but nothing serious."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,i haven't feel such emotions that gave this game for very long time. may be never. that's why such score
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this is a giant . the story is second to none, the graphics at times steal you away from your mission just to stop and look at the world, gameplay is fun, and the side quests are filled with so many hidden gems and easter eggs. i am constantly torn from wanting to see how the main story progresses to wanting to do all the side quests. the main quest gives you a fantastic story, but the side quests give you a looking glass into the world. they are just the best, some have you laughing, some that are best descried as fk yeah!, and some are extremely dark and heavy leaving you just mind blown or punched in the gut. the game does not sugar coat some themes, but it gives an immersive view of the fictional world and the people in it which makes you feel something for what is going on in front of you. combat is great giving you a variety of mechanics where you can cyber hack enemies incapacitating them or to distract while sneaking up to or past them, snipe them off one by one even through walls, pop a pin from a grenade and go full body demolition or leap through the air slicing limbs off. driving around feels a lot like gta, i do not care for it too much as first person is not as easy as 3rd person to navigate and 3rd person kind of breaks the immersion. however, it provides a way to get around the large map before you can fast travel. i wish there were an uber option where you can take in the sights of night city as a passenger. skills in this game are a little disappointing. they only make you a little better, stronger, smarter etc but do not really give you anything new to do. i guess some of this comes with implants which you buy. in this game it makes perfect sense to do it that way but it still feels a bit off. as for the bugs, there are quite a few but most of them are either not that big of a deal or are downright amusing. i sometimes enjoy some of the glitches for a laugh, they have not gotten in the way or blocked progressing a quest nor have they ruined the game for me. quite often if something seems to misbehave, i find a quick save and reload seems to fix it. i give this game a 1010 as i am really enjoying it a lot. if you are on an old console or prefer to play a more polished game, it may be best to wait. it would be a shame to miss it however as it is probably one of the best games of 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,game is fantastic on all fronts. the only problem i have with this game is that gpu manufacturers are more focused on doubling the price of their cards for no meaningful fps gain on high resolution monitors than actually pushing cuda cores to run 4k screens at over 50 fps
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i have a 20hour heavy weapons nomad save. shooting is okay. not good, not bad. same with character customization, could be a lot better. and the fact you can't customize your appearance later is extremely disappointing. driving takes a bit to get used to. especially with kbm. also, no vehicle customization? really? i dislike the fact they made this a looter shooter. having to constantly cycle through gear you find and get rid of what you have. this especially bothersome, when you find weapons  clothing you really like. and the fact they don't have transmog, your character looks like a walking style disaster. it doesn't matter if you hardly see your character ingame. i want my character to look the way i want them to look. this can be solved through looting  crafting, allowing you to upgrade your weapons  clothes. but due to how stingy receiving components are along with the high amount needed to actually upgrade items, it's better to just use the new items you pick up. with take away from the fact it's a rpg. to play the way you want to play. now, onto why i am giving this a 110, the 1 and not 0, as the game can be fun, when it originally would've been a 610. there is a bug that corrupts your save file, when it reaches a cap of 8mbs. usually, occurring around the 50hour mark or less if you craft often. easily half what you could do in tw3. what is cdpr's response to? just focus on beating the game, make a new character  repeat. really? that's it? what about all of the sideactivities? no response. will you expand the data cap? we might expand it in a future patch. might? you might expand it? an open world rpg with hundreds of actives with a very small time  data limit in 2020. completely unacceptable. you deserve your fall from grace, cdpr. and judging from everything, it will be a hard one. enjoy the flight."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i think people have their views on this game warped by the years of overhype the gameplay and game design is solid yet flexible, many mechanics are still useful to players who use builds that don't focus on those mechanics ie. hacking can still be useful for melee builds and visa versa the overall feel of the game is good sound is great and shooting feels good, storywise, pretty much every quest can end multiple ways. while the main quests aren't as flexible, the choices in side quests and bstory quests can have massive effects on events and characters and your relationships and rewards as a game, it is good the main problems that i have with the game is the bugs, granted these while there are a lot and varied, they don't actually bother me. i find them to be funny as hell and great meme material years of skyrim have made me numb to poor optimization overall it is a good game that needs some polish. it's not the best thing ever like some people thought it would be and people will always react emotionally when their impossible expectations are meet. final answer if you liked skyrim and the witcher, you will like cyberpunk 2077"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"what shall i say, its just not the game they promised. all the bugs aside its not even an rpg, despite all that talking about your choices and their impact on the story and the characters around you.. after they spend so much time talking about how important your decisions are and all that but in reality your decisions dont mean  . and as a nice bonus the entire world with all its potential feels just lifeless, despite all the useless npcs walking around."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"bugs sure but it's not like it's unplayable, the losers that give this a 0 are crazy. even with all it's bugs and crashes it's still a good game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i completed this game on the hardest difficulty. finished nearly all side quests. so, pros and cons of the game pros  great graphics of course on a good performance pc. and i hope the game will be optimized better in the future, because even with rtx 3080 i had 4550 fps in a city center on a 3440x1440 resolution  cool building system. you have a lot of ways how you can build your character. and you don't need to unlock useless perks to pick useful ones  cool gameplay in some ways. if you go melee it's quite fun to play  interesting story and a lot of side quests. some of them really touched me  nice ending, touched me. cons  bugs. a lot of them. hope it will be fixed soon  driving. couldn't drive anything but motorcycle in first person view  npc are stupid. fights using quickhucking are too simple and become boring. if you want more fun, go into melee  main story is too short. i played 100 hours. and developers made a really good job on side quests. but if i played only the main story, i could complete it in 1520 hours. after all, i can say, that the game could be a masterpiece, but it really feels, that it is unfinished. i expected a really long main story, like in the witcher 3 or rdr 2, but didnt get it. anyway, its worth playing, you can have a lot of fun, but maybe later, when most bugs will be fixed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,great storyline. the main story is captivating and very rewarding. side stories draw us into the world of cyberpunk and are often so well written that i can't tear myself away from my computer. at the beginning i was overwhelmed by the amount of side quest but after a few hours this feeling passed away. driving a car after a few hours is also satisfying for me. of course i had a few bugs but nothing special. i play on pc with medium and high settings.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this was an amazing game and definitely worth the money. i still have endless hours to play and have been enjoying the title. having put more than 50 hours in. this game is worth its full asking price on ps5. i have encounter a few bugs on launch that were quikly patched and cdpr has been working to continue to better this game. if you are an old gen user, specifically original ps4 etc. this may not be the best experience. go in knowing you will not be experienceing the same high quality as late to next gen consoles, which is to be expected. i think people are being too hard on cdpr and expecting too much for the masterpiece they have created. it takes endless hours over years to produce a game of this calibre and there will be bugs but they will also be patched. this has been true with every game in the history of video games. as games get larger and more complex and intricate and offer more, so do you expect the depth of bugs and issues. accept this, have patience. or move on. for 80 dollars canadian. this game has well paid for itself in the fun and enjoyment i have had out of it. i also have no issues supporting a game developer and employees who bust thier ass to create such a wild game. in closing.. is it worth it. yes. is there some bugs. yes. will they be fixed. yes. would i pay full price again for this title. yes. if you are ps4 pro, or ps5 users, pick this up. headlines look for attention and drama. it is an amazing game, and i believe it will only get better in time, just as the witcher 3 did. keep it up cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"preface this is the first time i have felt compelled to leave a review as the backlash from all of these entitled people trying to relive their burn ea to the ground glory days is making my head spin. this game is not terrible like they want you to believe. the majority of these bad reviews are coming from the same source of dissent that complained their way through a series of games all year tlou2, which the main complaint was gender fluidity inclusion. now on to cyberpunk. without a doubt the first week release was a bit spotty which is not surprising. the game truly is massive. i was surprised at how big and truly detailed night city is. nooks and crannies galore throughout and each location tells a story, from abandoned apartments to back alley hangouts to underground dwellings, it is amazing the amount of world story telling going on. the main story quests and side quests are truly very lovingly crafted and if one wants a game that is a wonderful single player experience, then this title is hard to disappoint. the writing is thought provoking and existential without being shallow or hollow in approach. a certain quest comes to mind that involves a man recently attempting to find god with the intent of redemption that i dont want to spoil, but left me reflecting for quite a bit afterwards. this type of writing is highly acclaimed in movies, think stanley kubrick, in how it has made me feel. deus ex attempted to ask the same question but was unable to commit to material this controversial so this is gladly appreciated. truly amazing. gameplay is where the title could cause some conversation and potential turn away for a couple of reasons. the game is similar to approach in titles like gta v but mixed with farcry. being that it is first person for the majority of the experience there are moments where the game seems to struggle with some things such object tracking and collisions. hence some of the bugs and glitches that are prevalent. in all honest it is most of the time more entertaining than game breaking though and has not impeded hardly any of my 40 play through so far i have hardly touched the main quests. since the first week patches though the game has drastically improved in a short time and i expect much more content and feature to be added as the game progresses as well. the soundtrack and radio are awesome as well, crafted from such acts the refused, converge, grimes, and many many others and being an original soundtrack really helps to flesh out the detail of the world. now for immersion sake there is some improvement in this area, more vendors, civilian and police ai repair, and maybe a slightly slower story pacing would be beneficial. all of which can be patched and most likely will. cdpr have been great about making sure their games are brought to their full potential even if it may take some additional time. witcher 3 truly was a masterpiece but had its fair share of problems as well. all in all, cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing homage to its source material and captivates in its writing supremely, from blade runner noir style detective cases, to political illuminati intrigue, and virtual reality sex cults, the game is not afraid to tackle the inevitable questions of what comes next? or how far we as a society could let things go even if it ends up being synonymous with material such as mike judges idiocracy. weighted down by a few entertaining bugs though, i imagine subtle improvements to what i consider an easy 8.5 game will facilitate a steady blossom into what may become a modern masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"after a hundred hours playing the game i can say this is the game ive waiting for since forever and i play games since early 90s. its a shame the failed launch, the problems on the past console generation... but ive never experienced a game of this quality. there are so much love and effort put in every aspect of this game, developers dont deserve this level of hate for bring us the best game of all times. obviously, there are some aspects of the game wich need a fix and some things im sure they will add with updates like hair and makeup cusstomization in game... but this game is breathtaking right now! im ready to spend some more hundreds of hours burning night city. and cant wait to experience the expansions and multi too. thank you cdprojekt. im really enjoying this master piece."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"es un juego al que hay que darle tiempo. no estamos acostumbrados a nada parecido. el juego no va de espectacularidad. ni va de trama argumental apabullante, de hecho hay demasiados elementos que componen la trama, no hay que hacerle mucho caso. el juego va de coleccionismo, de sumergirte en el mundo. me recuerda skyrim. solo que entiendo qu puede echar atrs antes de lo debido por los numerosos bugs que tiene. an as se disfruta igual. no son muy importantes los bugs. es un juego de completar ms y ms misiones y desafos. de hecho tambin me recuerda a grand theft auto san andreas."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"really disappointed. on a highend pc 3080, 5800x i experience constant popin, gamebreaking bugs, storyruining bugs, immersionbreaking bugs. every kind of bug of every kind of severity including tposing npcs, flatlining after climbing something, climbing an object and getting stuck, crosshair disappears, npcs don't show up as expected during missions, summoning your vehicle under other vehicles and causing them to explode, walking by certain npcs just makes them fight you, models clip into each other during common animations, first person animations are janky and jarring, interacting with objects can randomly place you underneath the map, dialogue is uninspired and inconsistent, and essentially everything is thin a veneer that  the moment you try to explore. good job ruining your entire reputation. this game needed another 612 months in development, that is undeniable. i've already restarted my playthrough once because of bugs and now i'm encountering more and am considering doing it again. but the story is already ruined for me, and it wasn't even good to begin with."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i have been waiting on this game for years, but i am very disappointed by cdpr and the development team on this game. the mechanics and skill trees in the game are great, body implants, perk trees, etc., but the biggest issues i have are mostly environmental. climbing can kill you when you are stuck. items that drop from enemies or static items are untargetable for me about 15 of the time. every once in awhile i can save and reload the game and the body will be repositioned and i can then pick up an item, but that is not very often. the game had so much potential, but i feel like i spend most of my time cheating because the enemy ai is so stupid. i'm fighting mobs level 38 in town and i'm only level 8 with a tech sniper rifle shooting them with headshots through walls. the mobs are so dumb they just sit behind a dumpster getting blasted. oh and i'm playing on hard mode also. i do die a lot, but mostly because the mobs just throw a gun over a dumpster or around a corner with 100 accuracy unrealistic. i originally bought the game on ps4, but it was unplayable so i got a refund and purchased it on pc instead. now i see the ps store refunded everyone and took it off the store. if i were cdpr, i would not put out another game...ever. they will have to spend the next few years fixing this game as it is. pretty sad there are already unlimited money things like selling a painting for 4k and repurchasing it back from a vendor for 5 and doing that over and over again. cdpr probably won't get to that patch for months so have a ball! the game also crashes randomly 12 games per session for me running a gtx2060 on my laptop and guns intermittently won't fire. pretty ridiculous for the perfection it was supposed to be! if they had spent more time on environment then placing a don'g every 3 ft inside some buildings, maybe the game wouldn't be so buggy. sheesh."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"j'ai jou plus de 15h au jeu. cp2077 est trs dcevant, mais a des points positif tout de mme. son gros point fort est clairement son univers, le cyberpunk, night city est une ville trs agrable a visit et a des personnages assez russi . pour ce qui est du reste c'est la  froide. il est remplie de bug, ia a la ramasse, crash, gameplay bien sans plus... trop de hype pour pas grand chose."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"played it for 80 hrs on pc 2080 rtx and love that game so much. ever since i played the first deus ex or read do androids dream of electric sheep i wanted to see a game likes this. sure its has bugs and is far from perfect yet. but whoever compares it to gta has never played this game. it got me stuck as fallout 4 and 3, and is the best i played in a while with titles like tlou2 or death stranding."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this negative review has nothing to do with the bugs and poor performance on a good pc. i want to address the many issues the core and mechanics of the game exhibit.. the game is lifeless, forcefully scripted, soulless, frustrating, poorly executed, a narrative mess, poorly paced, badly designed, ugly and bland. this game is a let down in so many ways, its like cdpr took gta 5, deus ex, arkam knight and fallout 4, mixed them together and crapped out a worse version of all the games. story is completely on rails, there are literally no choices. things just seem to happen in front of your character and they call that the story. quests boil down to go travel a long distance to this spot, follow this person and stare at their ass while things happen in front of you, then you get into a car that feels like its a train on rails and you watch other things happen in front of you, then you have to shoot things while on rails. the city is lifeless and empty, nowhere interesting to go and nothing interesting to do, npc's feel like animated plastic dolls with no purpose, walk around aimlessly and do nothing. this game was designed as a first person immersion game but its like they dont want you to be in first person looking at things because it all lacks so much detail and polish that it immediately pulls you out of immersion. example dont dare look out the front of the car while you are being driven around happens a lot it looks like you are on a disney ride and not in a car. the ai is completely broken and some of the dumbest emeries you will encounter in any modern game, complete bullet sponges like 10 point blank shots from a shotgun wont kill. you can stagger enemies and then shoot them several times on the ground point blank while they still get up and shoot you, makes no sense. cops are completely broken will spawn behind you in a matter of seconds if you do anything wrong and then just sort of go away. campaign leaves no choices to be made, the dialog options are non existent. melee combat is a mess, stealth mechanics are a joke, the minigame parts of missions like the braindance or scouting ahead to plan a route are horrible tedious and a waste of time. gunplay is average at the very best, but gets ruined by the braindead bullet sponge enemies you have to fight, basic crafting system that leaves a lot to be desired, also weird how you can craft anywhere like you will need to craft bullets magically in the middle of a fight because of just how much ammo it takes to kill a small number of enemies just more immersion breaking. side quests are a terrible, too many phone calls from npcs that you cant ignore while driving.narratively the games has nothing to say and is just a series of follow, find and fetch quests, that just sort of happen to your character, or things just sort of happen when your character shows up. i wanted to like this game but for the few moments i can seem to get past all the negative stuff im just left either bored or frustrated.. two things you never want from a game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"the game is unplayable. no, like, literally unplayable. at first i couldn't launch it, had to reinstall the whole damn thing. after that it did launch, but it barely ran even in the lowest settings, not to mention the bugs. i wish i could talk about what's actually in the game, but if you can't play it, it's as good as 0."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i am about 35 hours in and am really loving this game. the closest comparison i can think of is the original deus ex, which is one of my favourite games of all times. are there glitches? yes. does this game represent the dawning of a new era of gaming? no. are the world, characters and story immersive and engaging? heck yes. this is the first game in awhile that i've found myself itching to get back to when i'm at work, out running errands, etc. it's a super fun world to be in and i've been loving stumbling upon random side quests in the city. i know a lot of people have been having issues, but i haven't run into any gamebreaking glitches, the environment is super detailed, the shooting mechanics are smooth, and the game, for me, hasn't crashed once. my favourite games are ones that have rich storylines and excellent voiceacting in both the main storyline and side quests, and this game really delivers on that front. while it's not the most epic, revolutionary game ever, it's easily my favourite game of the past 3 years."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"im not going to overreact here and say its the worst game ive ever played, but its pretty disappointing. here are the positive things i have to say about the game 1. the story is pretty interesting. while avoiding spoilers, i will just say that its a 710 story. 2. on the surface, the side quests seem deep but when you realize only two or three of the storylines have any depth, you realize they are actually just main quests in the wrong section of the journal. 3. the colors and sounds of the game are refreshing and unique. 4. the gunplay and melee combat are pretty fun. ready for the negatives? im only going to list the first few that come to mind 1. this game is not open world. its a linear storyline in a big box. there is literally nothing worth doing other than the main storyline if you count the few friend side quests as main story, which in my opinion you should. 2. customization is nonexistent. the character creation at the beginning gives you barely any control other than skin color, hair type which youre stuck with forever, and for some reason genitalbreast size which ends up serving absolutely no purpose other than laughing when you change your characters clothes or when the game glitches out and shows your dongboobies through your outfit. 3. lack of consequences. nothing you do matters...like...literally nothing. kill everyone, or no  one cares more than one line of dialogue worth. murder 200 people in front of the cops, wont matter. want to punch a storyline character in the face? sorry you cant because they didnt have time to program the consequences of doing that. 4. glitches. im not even going to take the time to list any...that would be beating a dead horse at this  trust me, theyre everywhere. i havent completed a single mission without seeing a glitch that makes skyrim look like a clean launch. 5. the ? you get calls and texts constantly from contacts telling you about  heres the problem...theres no freaking reason to get any of them! the driving is horrible and the cars all drive exactly the same and look really stupid. the messages and calls you get about them are the equivalent of a popup ad. 6. the graphics.  graphics...keep in mind that i have an rtx 3080, so ive likely experienced the best this game has to offer. for the first 6090 minutes i thought okay this game looks kinda  skin textures are cool, the hair looks terrible, but okay if this game is enormous this is acceptable.  game isnt enormous and only the main characters look good. literally everyone in the city looks like a grand theft auto character except your storyline contacts and only half of those characters look good. the screenshots you saw of keanu are borderline false advertisement. think back to the days when a ps1 game would only show the cutscenes in the advertisements. metal gear solid vs graphics put this game to shame. who knows? maybe in 7 years this game will look great when rtx 3080s are on sale on craigslist for 40 bucks. 7. tedious. most of the game is honestly tedious. way too many parts that lock you out of certain movements and youre stuck bored listening to the same stupid dialogue after a horribly placed checkpoint because it locks you out of saving for 20 minutes straight. i could go on with my complaints, but im going to wrap this up by saying that this game in no way deserves a 010. 510 is still a failing score, but there was some fun to be had playing this game, but at this point i dont see myself giving the dlc a chance. even if the game worked perfectly its just not a fun game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"really enjoying my time with this game. looking at other reviews, i guess that i should consider myself lucky because i have not experienced the level of glitches and bugs that others have noted. at about 70 hrs in, i have been averaging around 6070 fps on 1440. i did not know too much about the pre launch hype so i i started playing without knowledge of what to expect. i just know that i really enjoy playing this game. it has most of the elements that keep me hooked hours at a time. i like the deux ex style of completing missions totally different ways. i can go in guns blazin, stealth, hacking, or a combo of all. i like that the characters are fleshed out and have stories to tell. i love the rpg depth with character creation that sets you up to really think about how you want to play. i have read the negative reviews, but i was willing to roll the 60 dice, and i am glad that i did. i never stop getting a kick out of people saying that nobody should like a game because they think it is trash. i prefer to come to my own conclusions based on personal experience with games. i will say that i do have a high end rig, which i am sure has an effect on my gameplay experience. just dont skip this game if you think it is up your alley."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i have to literally force myself to finish the main story let alone the side quests. i can only say that the problems of cyberpunk 2077 go way further beyond its bugs and glitches. apart from the visual quality only if you own a highend rig, story, animations, voice acting, and some of the ambient music it's mediocre, shoddy, cheap, empty, and the behavior of the world is stupid and dumb. genuinely, the game's not even worth reviewing. the highly scored critic reviews? i don't really understand what the game got those for. this needs a psychologist but i guess it would be determined as mass posttraumatic stress disorder or something. it's nothing like what was promised a literally nothing like witcher. anyway, it's garbage. waste your time on something else."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"the game that was supposed to combine watch dogs, gta v and watcher 3 into the best game that we have ever seen... obviously it isn't that. its shallow and weak. forget about bugs and such just focus on depth and mechanics. its so sad. truly one of the saddest things to come out of 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"first of all i wanted to say that i normally don't pre order anything, i know aaa games typically look better in trailers and marketing material than they actually are. however i did make an exception for cyberpunk 2077. cdpr had a reputation of being an honest game maker and i'm really a big fan of rpgs and open world games like the witcher 3 and fallout 4. i poured probably about 200 hours total into the witcher 3, playing the whole base game and both dlcs. i figured cyberpunk would be at least decent. so i get cyberpunk on steam for pc, boot it up and start playing. i figured out within about the first hour or so of gameplay that life paths don't really play that big of a part in the game, leading up to launch, cdpr said it would be a part of the game but it wasn't. besides that, the story is decent but i think they made it too short for an rpg game. red dead 2, gta 5 aren't even rpgs and they have a longer storyline, fallout 4 has a ton of side quests and the fact you can choose different factions to have different endings. cyberpunk has no such system. the story feels rushed. now for my problems with the game mechanics, cdpr said they would release cp 2077 when it was ready and the game mechanics don't look like those  that is ready in 2020. besides all of the bugs, which i am willing to forgive since all games have bugs and they can get patched, the game mechanics are a major letdown. gta 5, a game released 7 years ago has better game mechanics. the driving system is clunky and unrealistic, npcs look like zombies that barely even react to you, in gta 5 a npc can either fight you or run away but npcs in cyberpunk just run away. in gta 5, if you shoot water, you see a splash but in cyberpunk there is no splash. in gta 5 if you throw a grenade in the water, it makes a boom sound and you see water ripples but not in cyberpunk. the wanted system is a disaster, the cops just spawn on foot and don't chase you in cars. this was not the game that was promised to us, and i have the pc version. console players have it much much worse."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"honestly... i wanted this to be really good. i was looking forward to this for years. well it didn't quite live up to what was promised but all in all it's a pretty solid but way to short stoy game. graphics are really good. and the voice acting is absolutely amazing. better even than many movies i have seen. performance is bretty bad tho... even on a decent pc  i7 and rtx 2080 and then there is the bugs... uncountable ammount of bugs... invisible weapons, cars stuck in the ground or randomly exploding for no reason. npcs are tposing every couple 100m and the list, enemys are stuck in walls, so you can't finish mission and the list goes on and on. barely playable a lot of times. when it is playable tho it is a really fun game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this game is not ideal , there are some bugs and technical problems. maybe gameplay is not so innovative . but i got lost in this beautifull city , characters and dialogues are perfect , and i didnt notice spending all the weekend in the game , 50 hous as 1 breath . so for me the game is perfect ,words wont tell emotions it gave to me ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"game isn't flawless as it was marketed. but on pc game looks amazing, true next gen title. plot is also absolutely fantastic. first game since gta5 and witcher3 that can hold my attention. amazing city with a lot of detail. but weak ai. the game does not deserve 10 points, but everything is learned in comparison, modern aaa tiles are significantly inferior to cyberpunk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"great world, atmosphere, and story. the game can be a bit buggy in annoying and sometimes hilarious ways but fortunately saving and reloading will fix anything i came across that was game breaking except my character going bald whenever i looked into a mirror. choices matter some and there is tons of side content to keep you busy where the story itself gives you about five total endings. it is hard for the game to live up to the hype but i was very much entertained and recommend it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"after 33.5 hours of gameplay, i have finished the game, including all major side quests. the game has many showstopper bugs. overall, the game is good, but it is short, not immersive, and does not provide a real openworld experience. i did not connect to the empty.. night city and driving is a mess. probably 10 years ago this game would have been considered a good game, unfortunately, today, this game failed to deliver."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"lo peor de este juego ha sido lo que ms me ha gustado, gracias a la innumerable cantidad de bugs que tiene siempre he tenido algo divertido que ver en youtube. por otro lado, el juego no es ms que bueno, no es destacable, no es ni de cerca lo que prometieron, le faltan muchas cosas, la historia es muy corta, las misiones secundarias son mejores que las principales, el mundo est vaco, te aburres despus de las primeras 25 horas. una lstima, todos confibamos en la gente de cd projekt."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"right up front, i want to say that my heart goes out to those playing this game on lastgen consoles. the bugs and performance issues are inexcusable, and cdpr will need to work hard to get those games to an acceptable state and to recoup some of the goodwill they've burned through during this release process. that being said, i've played about 45 hours on a gaming laptop pc with an i79750h and the mobile version of the rtx 2070, and the game runs well. my graphical settings are more or less set at medium across the board, and i've managed to achieve a consistent 60 fps, with minor drops in heavilypopulated or particularly detailed areas. i've experienced occasional graphical glitches, but nothing beyond what i've come to expect in openworld games of a similar size  scope. and most importantly, i've not yet encountered any crashes or gamebreaking bugs. performance issues aside, i've really enjoyed my time playing cyberpunk 2077. the world design is visually stunning, and night city is probably the coolest and most interesting looking open world i've ever experienced. the storyline is engaging, particularly some of the deeper side quests, and the game is chockfull of memorable and interesting characters. the gameplay loop is satisfying and allows for a decent variety of approaches, from stealth to melee to gunsblazing. while the leveling  perks system doesn't break any new grounds, it's fairly deep and allows you to craft your character to your preferred play style. unfortunately, i think it's this distinct lack of breaking new grounds that has directly fueled a lot of the backlash against the game. cdpr has had the marketing dial turned up to 11 for the past few years and has consistently promised players that the game would be the next step in the evolution of open world games. while the visual design of the world is unparalleled, the gameplay cribs from a lot of established conventions and doesn't really offer any significant innovations. the level of interactivity touted by the game's marketing is sorely lacking. while traversing night city and taking in its sights is a blast, you won't find as many of the random, unexpected moments like you would in an rdr2 or gta5 that truly make an open world feel like a real place. npcs are largely set dressing, and the criticisms about npc ai are completely valid. while they all look and sound unique, the game does nothing to make them feel distinct from one another in terms of how they react and engage with you. and on the road, npc drivers feel particularly brainless, seemingly incapable of driving around your parked vehicle. the police system is also totally borked, with police appearing behind you as soon as you do something illegal regardless of whether you're downtown or in the middle of the desert. i typically don't play open world games for the sake of causing pandemonium, so this has been less of a disappointment for me. but, different people engage with open worlds in different ways, so it's something to be aware of. i very much hope that cdpr fixes  improves some of these systems in future patches  improved and variable npc ai both onfoot and invehicle, believable police, and emergent npc interactions would go a long way in helping night city feel like a real place. however, it'll be more difficult to fix or improve many of the absent roleplaying elements. as much as marketing hyped the choice and consequence aspects of the game, very few of my choices thus far have felt like they've had a real impact on the story either in specific quest lines or on the overarching narrative as a whole. for example, the maelstrom questline at the beginning of the game that was shown off in so many preview features feels like a vertical slice from a previous, more ambitious iteration of the game, as it offers multiple critical paths to reach its end. but i've been disappointed to find that subsequent quests over my 45 hours of play haven't really offered a comparable level of choicedependent branching. it just smacks of a development team paring down the scope and complexity of its game in order to contend with unrealistic time constraints. i do very much hope that we get some solid investigative reporting into the story behind cyberpunk 2077 and why cdpr were unable to deliver on some of the game's mostanticipated gameplay elements. while i've spent quite a bit of time discussing some of the most significant negatives of the game, i do absolutely recommend it, and i've very much enjoyed my time in night city. as a beautiful game that works within the standard conventions of an openworld action game with an rpg characterbuilding system, the game is fantastic. but as a revolutionary roleplaying experience with a realisticallycomplex and unparalleled open world, the game fails to deliver on many of the promises made by cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"played on pc an amazing game which evolves the way story and progression is told during gameplay. immersive and fun, a pity the amount of bugs present at launch, which i'm sure will be addressed later on. still, a gem."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,fantastic game set in a beautiful world . it gives me flash backs to my first witcher 3 preview . if you have a decent gaming pc the graphics are awesome . i'm 40 hours into my first playthrough as nomad and there is that much to do i don't even really think to move the main quest on . the side quests are that well thought out and substantial its fun just doing that . then there's the cop shoot outs and random activities and hidden gems to find. well worth the money . don't be fooled by the hate bandwagon surrounding this game some of it is justified especially on old consoles due to bugs but a lot of it is people trying to make this another andromeda or fallout 76. cdpr have historically fixed bugs in there games and should be given the chance to do the same here . delivered everything they promised for me and once the bugs are fixed its goy.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"if not the most then it surely is one of the most hyped games to release to this day, the game being announced in 2012 does not entail that it has been in development since that given year. at the time they also had to work on witcher. cyberpunk 2077, a game with a rich storyline and in a world where you are able to explore and do a lot is truly phenomenal, despite the game being buggy at launch it is still a masterpiece, these bugs will be squashed, cd projekt red have a good track record for this. the immersion of this game, the quality, the gameplay is truly one to make you play the game for hours and hours. the way you complete missions are entirely up to you, go all out or do it in a stealthy way. as known, the game does have multiple endings although, these endings all depend on the stories you complete before proceeding with the final main mission. the rpg element of this game is not present most of the time, there are some key decisions to be made upon completion of the game, it is more of an action adventure type of game rather than an actual rpg even though there is a hint of rpg in the game. by next year hopefully this game is more stable which will allow more people to enjoy this game and hopefully we see more features introduced into this game since the potential is there."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i have no problem with game itself, atmosphere of this city is good, story is engaging so far. but my problem is how buggy and bad performing it is. there is ugly blury aa which can't be turned off, can barely see eyes and mouth on my face when in 3rd person on motorbike how terrible it is. would not be such issue if game was running at least at 2k, but on my gtx 1080ti it just can't on solid fps. there is no other game i could not run on high at 1440p and have 6080 fps  here i have to play on mediumhigh and fhd to have 60 fps and it still drops to 4550 in some situations. also mouse movement is not very smooth. i've never seen worse optimized aaa title except gta 4 release which was the worst... edit so after 60 hours of playtime it's like this for me atmosphere of the city and this whole cyberpunk world strong 1010 story 910 or 8.510, hard to decide for me, disliked few things here, but still liked it very much technical state on my pc 510 tons of minor bugs, glitches, stupid ai and bad performance even on still quite solid gtx 1080ti, but i had no crashes at all and was bugged only twice in those 60 hours to such a degree i had to load last checkpoint because of it recustomisation options 010  this is absolutely the weakest part of this game for me, it's basicly non existent  you can't change look of your character, not even hairstyle, hair color or tattooswtf, wtf and again wtf we are in cyberpunk man, you can replace your organs and whole eyes and you can't change color?!?!?. you also can't hide helmet or transmog one armor skin into another but i could accept this decision of devs even if i don't agree with it. another problem is recustomisation of playstyle. you can reset perks, but it's mostly for fixing few missplaced talents. the most important thing defining your whole playstyle can't be changed at all, there is no way to redistribute attributes like intelligence, reflexes etc. so you are telling me that when i am tired of deadly samurai with katana and want to try hacker path, i have to play whole game again? are you seriously serious? if i want to try 3 different builds i have to play on 3 different saves?!? new game is the only option here, because you can't fully reset and you can't have everything on max lvl... ...and that's why i can't go for high rating. there is potential for 1010 in this game, but it needs some serious tuning. to me it feels like early acces in many ways. i would like to go for at least 8.510, because this game really deserves more than 6 or 7, but not right now, not in this state and with so many good features missing."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"omg!!!! this game is the worst game i've ever played. 1. the performance is really bad even if i have all the recommended hardware. fps is fluctuating all the time some part of the city gives 60 fps and some part of the city give 20 fps even i lower my resolution to 1600900. 2. the cdpr lied to us about the features of the game. it does not have any revolutionary feature in gameplay or the story. 3. the gunplay is the most clunkiest ever in any game i've ever experienced only johnny silverhand gunplay feels good . 4. the emotional connection to the story is zero . i literally never cared once about my character for any upgrades or skills . 5. omfg!!! the a.i. of this game...... omfg!!!!! its worse then the pubg mobile bots.........police was spawning in the walls. 6. after making this game for about 8 yrs...... they even did not given any drm security.......i am literally feeling myself scammed that i've wasted so much money which i can use to play any other game. and i prepurchased it btw . 7. the car driving ......it's the worst in any game i've ever played. 8. the stealth mode in this games is just straight up broken. 9. the characters of this feels so lifeless and boring af..........only johnny silverhand is awesome. 10. the biggest bad point of this game is that it is not  nothing as compared to any other game in the market right now. i will give  15 .....one mark only bocz of johnny  don't waste your time and money on this bad , overhyped , unfinished and boring ass game. first prepurchased game of my  middle finger to cdpr. best lesson from this game is  never ever get on the hype train ."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"ive put almost 100 hours into this game now and now i can tell you what  and whats good. the only thin im going to say about the bugs is that im stunned that cd project shipped the game in this poor state. whatever happened to coming when its ready??? i've lost all trust in that aspect to them. i begin whith the first thing you experience graphics. is it any good? well, yes and no. very uneven. some parts of the game look amazing and the citys architecture is fenominal, but everything that isnt tied to the main story or the side missions have a noticable lower graphical standard and the difference is too big its distracting. sound design is the same way. the sounds that are there are phenomenal and the music is captivating but then there are actions that completely lack sound like breaking certain windows and crafting makes no sound at all. the stories told in this game are slightly above avarage but nothing a will reflect upon. there is no satisfaction after completing a questline like when youve done something in the witcher 3 for example. the biggest problem this game has though is the main character v and hishers trusty sidekick keanu. v is the most generic character ive seen in a videogame since cole from the first two infamous games. grizzly voiced tough guy with a heart of gold paired with an overrated actor that has only put out mindless action movies the past decade that pops in out of nowhere to say something snarky. either you have a silent protaganist like in skyrim, or you give us a character that already has a story and a real personality. gun play is suprisingly good, i thought that aspect of the game would be bad and the role playing would be good but its completely reversed. guns have a real kick to them and shooting holes and limb off of people have never been this much fun. the cyberware is a good way to customize your character to how you want to play. wanna be a sneaky netrunner who hacks into people and things or do you want to be a superfast ninja that cuts people up without anyone has the time to react? the choice is yours. so if youre looking for an futuristic action game with a decent story then i would highly recoment this, just dont expect to be  into an amazing story of how cyberenhancments is changing us as people, its not there."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"god 6amn, this game is awesome! don't listen to haters, cyberpunk will be the game of the year as witcher 3!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"there is no doubt in my mind the people voting negative haven't even played the game, or at best tried to run it with their 1050 ti and refunded it. this game has technical issues, yes, there are features that evidently got cutrushed due to all the  whining that the same  who didn't play the game brought upon cdpr to ignite their greed into an early release. but the base game is so incredible that even with those issues you easily round it out to a 10. play the game instead of whining about everything you spineless little hateful"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"the game is brilliant, love the look, love the story, i know there are some bugs here and there, but it's brand new and it's massive, updates will come and fix it, once more a diamond from cd projekt red, thank you guys for the awesome game!!!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"bad game, i dont like buged games, they spend a lot of  on fakes reviews"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"great graphics, but a bit buggy. optimisation is not perfect, but the atmosphere is extremely good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this review is based on my experience with the game, i know the base playstation and xbox is an absolute shambles. however i played this on an rtx 2070, with rt turned off and it ran very well, the only exception was if i alt tabbed. the game did have some buggy moments but nothing that stopped me progressing. noting how tw3 was released, i kind of expected a buggy release too but that shouldnt take away how bad the last gen console releases are. moving on to the game, night city is a master piece, a truly stunning experience that i dont think is matched in an open world. the story writing is incredible and the voice acting from the whole cast is top tier. side missions are fantastic and have better plots than some main games, this has always been cdpr forte and they deliver here again. why only an 8 then? i was hoping this would be a true rpg and on this it doesnt truly deliver. maybe this is due to how hyped this game was, but i dont think they helped themselves with the marketing on this either. comparing to rdr2 the npcs feel so much more alive and realistic, its a really lived in world, you can take time to immerse yourself in the community where this never feels possible in cyberpunk. all the npcs feel so plastic and pointless, the police ai is non existent and the need to go down a certain build such as a tech engineer or a gun slinger isnt really necessary at all. this is a fantastic story driven game, that i had a lot of fun with but as an rpg it falls short."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"it's a shame. if i could, i would rate the story, but due to massive performance issues on my pc, i was not able to play the game a lot. in fact, i was only able to really play the game about an hour or less. i had like max 15 fps on foot and up to 10 fps when driving. then i drove to my quest, parked the car and... the npc just walks into my car, drops dead onto the pavement and the cops are called. all in all, the npcs in the game just act and seem like robots, with no cause other than run up and down the streets of night city. i was not able to talk to merchants or, in fact, anybody. i don't expect a full dialogue for everybody, but at least some generic comment like for example in fallout. apart from the lifeless appearance of night city the rest of the game decided to show me in many details that i am in a game. people and corpses bugging into walls and the floor, the wonderful behavior of the drivers rearending, stopping on a green light, road raging for no apparent reason and the loud, annoying noises the game decided to randomly create loud cracking and such i think that's because of performance issues. the game was overall painful to play. i am going as far as to say that even fallout 76 was running smoother and was more pleasant to play at release. it is not worth anything near 20, not to mention the 60 i had to pay to play this horrible game. i am never going to buy a single game from cd project red again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"you are great guys, thank you for everything. the game is incredible, 40hrs playing and didnt finish the second chapter yet. im with you and i fully trust in you! love u all and happy holidays"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"the open world is dead. you actually cant do anything besides the quests. where is braindance? you get the item for using it and you can buy bds, but you cant play them. your actions doesn't have an impact to the world police won't chase you, you can't do anything in your appartement, can't mod cars, no minigames. cdpr promised an openworld rpg. but it's not that. it's a dead, empty world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,so far so good! welcome in night city. after the patch 1.05  works better on my pc! ty!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"how to get from cyberpunk fan to cyberpunk hater... just buy that game. graphics great but nothing so extra special gameplay jeaa a little bit boring. played for a week, later no will"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"great game. have played about 50 hours and am loving it. bugs are few and only one impacted gameplay, im sure those will get fixed. great story and gameplay so far."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"well... i wrote this review to give a fair warning before buying this game. there has been a lot of marketing and hype around this game. this raised the bar on expectations about this game. is it a bad game? no. does it deliver what has been promised? big no. is the game finished? no. far from it. it is glitchy and the open world feels empty.  great setting  good graphics  storytelling is great main storyline  jesus walks on water in night city! npc  cars are very glitchy.  side jobs are a few variants of fetch andor kill. gets boring really fast  combat ai is nonexistent.  combat is glitchy thrown knifes dissapear, enemies get stuck easy kills  city feels empty. very little interaction with npc's, most buildings are inaccessible.  cops ai is nonexistent. materialise right behind you, won't chase you also see remark about combat ai  call your car to your location mr. scott beams your car down right next to you.  driving is like first drinking a full bottle of whisky, then get behind the steering wheel. not good. in my opinion cdpr should have focused on the main storyline and build  expand on the open world for future games in this setting. this would have given them the possibilities to prioritise on fixing the engine, ai, basic systems. now we got a mixed bag of everything."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"it starts out so good. i loved jackie and v's bromance, and the mission in arasaka tower. as the story progresses though, there is a clear drop in quality control. some side mission quest lines are playable without problems, while others aren't. there is also a massive problem with how your character picks things up, does stealth kills, or uses a computer. the game has trouble knowing what you're aiming at when you are up close to multiple options. if there is a piece of garbage beside a valuable weapon, sometimes looking at the weapon from any angle will leave you with no other option than to pick up the garbage first. this is problematic in stealth, as picking up garbage instead of initiating a stealth takedown on your target is frequently interrupted by your character picking up a bottle of fizzy water, or logging into a terminal. this is especially problematic since this game has bad auto saves. this problem is not tied to key binding, and there is no way in the game to cycle between options in these cases. there are many problems with this game that entirely stem from their release of a halfbaked product. it would take months of work for cdpr to fix everything. underneath all of the  though, there is a very good game, as is evident in the polished beginning missions."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,besides the bugs which can easily be fixed over time this game is fantastic. the story and characters are good and interesting. the world is great too. night city is beautiful and one of the best cities ive seen in a video game. theres always things that could be better in any game. but i am throughly enjoying it. 50 hours in and not even close to done
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"i don't like to rate games as soon as they are released, so i played this game for 60 hours! and here's what i can say 1. rpg. this is not, this is a linear action shooter. i had a moment when i had to complete the mission to get into the elevator to get to the building to steal the chip. i said to myself  this is an rpg game, there should be options, the witcher 3 was the standard of options and i decided to close the task and do it the way i want it! i walked away from the elevator and started looking for other options, and i found. the staircase, only it was blocked in two places, it was already a call to the fact that the developer did not want to give options. but i am a singleminded person, and i had a reinforced jumping implant available. and i got where my mission was leading! and then i thought i would get what i always got in the witcher 3, but ... rpg asked me to enter the elevator. in witcher 3, any of my actions were rewarded, with new lines or something else. as for example with a goat, when geralt said it's good that i was here before and killed a bear cyberpunk is not an rpg game! cyberpunk will say wait for the bear to respawn and kill again 2. cars and motorcycles. 1person view when i saw i was glad! but! having traveled for a couple of hours, i realized what's what! the first is there is no way to look back, funny right? imagine you are driving a car but you cannot see what is behind it. and all why because there are no camera mirrors, i do not see what is behind me there. why pretend 1 person if you dont pretend? but this is only the first, the second there is a car such that from the first person you cannot see the road at all, that is, not only can you not see what is behind, but also the roads are ahead. thank goodness i found some of the vehicles that can be driven from one person. motorcycles ... they are, and it would be better if they were not! i think the car is bad, but the motorcycle is even worse! having traveled on them, you want to get behind a car. 3. bugs! here i can even say personally to cdpr, you have a mistake in the name of the game. not cyberpunk, but cyberbug! there are so many errors that sometimes i do not know who i am, a beta tester who should give information what new bugs have i found or i am a player who should enjoy playing the game. and there are a lot of bugs, you don't even need to look for them. enough to walk on the rails of the game and they will be found, which is only the jackie when we meet him and he eats and the sticks are not only behind his back, but also what he holds gives out a duplicate overlapping each other. and it will be all the time, objects fly all the time! bugs are a separate topic because they are big. items are not picked up, i even caught a bug that deleted my saves, thank god i had auto saves, otherwise i would be angry. even sometimes the chests did not open, i even caught in the mission that my doors did not even open. and this is only a part of the bugs, it seems when the developer took 8 months he said we want to make this game better than anything, there will be no bugs i want to ask them personally, what take 8 months? bugs are everywhere, you don't need to look for them, they will find you themselves and they are critical! 4. languages. i will take my language  russian as an example. the voice acting has claims to it, and these are claims that in some places it is not voiced. but here there are already few moments, even very few. and now i will start talking about subtitles as well as the text that has been translated! to say that everything is bad is to say nothing at all! in some places it is not translated, in some places there are spelling errors, and i still dont take punctuation. do you understand what i mean? ok, i'll write a text that everyone knows but will intentionally make mistakes so that you understand how it hurts the eye, there will be the word warcraft wcaarft. but no, there are also such errors warcccraft. i don't, where is the quality translation? i just want to ask what did you take 8 months for ?! because you can see not about any little things even out of the question. all the problems are very very very big, the game is not ready even now! 5. optimization. the graphics are beautiful but not optimized. i'm walking in a crowd, or let's say a shootout with explosions  4k 4060 fps, i look at a 4k corpse 12 fps. i just want to ask, what should load more? what kind of small texture or action shootout? i have better shots for a shootout than i will look at a separate part of it. 6. the plot. jackie and v friendship was shown just by flashbacks, only for these flashbacks i throw off a lot of this game! spoilers that showed cdpr, jackie's death ... i'm disappointed with cdpr. i will not preorder more than one game from this developer. so many lies, so much deception... deceive me once, sin is you, deceive me twice  sin is for me"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"this game is so amazing, story is great and gameplay too. yes there are some bugs, but in my playthrough i didnt really noticed them. comepared to somthing like ac valhalla, this is far more finished. no one mentions that ac valhalla is unplayable, it crashs at least once an hour. but in cyberpunk there are a few little glitches an everyone goes insane. i cant really understand this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,i like the game the story nice. but the bugs destroy the game feel a
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,"not gonna lie, the game would have greatly benefit from another 12 years of finalizing und optimizing especially for console, but if you can look over the bugs, glitches an really simplistic ai , the game blowed my mind as far as design, beautiful emotional story writing, world design  yeah its not alive as in red dead 2, but all of the massive the side quests are unique and fun! , next lvl graphics i played on a 3080 maxed out goes. give it a try and maybe you will love it like myself or maybe not... dont judge to early !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,ubisoft games have a similar amount of bugs but no one gets the pain of their ass
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-20,so i played the game on a fairly budget pc ryzen 5 1600 rx 580 8gb with optimised 60fps settings high textures and everything else on medium low with cas res scale to 80 and a fps lock and i didn't experience so many immersion breaking bugs or performance hiccups it really felt like the farcry experience and that's not so much a compliment knowing how buggy and fun inthe same time ubisoft games are. the only really annoying bug was the lod low polygon charachters some times after loading the game because i've installed it on a hddd like the consoles so even with the really slow iw hdd setting.. it still has issues with mechanical drives even if mine is faster than a console . still i had and i'm still having plentiful of fun. i actually thought i woukd hate the combat but i feels fun. driving might be needing some improvement. the story is suoerb too but it felt kinda really short. even with side quest many times. anyhow it's a great game and i'm sure the cdpr will patch the life out of it near christmas and be the product we all expected to love.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"this game has an unprecedented level of detail and love. a truly great developer respects your time and intelligence, and ultimately gives you more of the writing and stories that compel you to continue and invest your time in the game. that's the biggest thing this game brings to the table. simple side quest in cyberpunk could be the story arc for a lesser game. but it's not just the writing... the areas of the world you'd never have a reason to visit have obviously had care and love put into them. that said, the game is structured very similarly to witcher 3 in the future. the side quest, and random encounters are all there, with the quality turned up a notch or two. regarding bugs there are plenty, you'll see one every two missions. most of them are harmless items you can't pick up, a partial reflection in a window some are worse... i had to play through a quest 5 times to get the enemies to spawn correctly. i still love the game, it's like dating beyonc but she wants you to be vegan, you'll work around it, it's not a deal breaker. perhaps worse than the bugs is the performance, i would not play this game without a rtx 3080 or better... cd projekt absolutely pushed the graphical envelope, but it doesn't come cheap. to make matters worse the cards are only available at a mark up. this is extremely frustrating but not the developer's fault."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"bugs, bugs and bugs and glitches. besides the bugs and glitches, a lot of things they promised they would add are missing. this is no mans sky all over again. story is mediocre. this is not the game they promised."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"even with bugs, stupid ai and hundreds of shortcomings it's worth playing. great quests, great storyline. it's a shame game wasn't postponed again till next year. i still trust it was possible to polish it accordingly."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"well, this was disappointing. not glitches or crashes for me, crashes were very rare, only crashed once. some funny bethesda ragdoll glitches, but never anything gamebreaking. performance was actually very solid considering i'm running it on a gtx 1060 3gb that ran red dead ii so poorly i quit until i got a better card. actually, major props for that, especially considering how visually atmospheric the world is. but that's about all i can say about the world. there's no charm to leaving no stone unturned, there's really nothing here but bandit camps and a main story that feels over just as it's begun, with characters that are practically strangers, even silverhand. this is hardly an rpg at all, in the storytelling sense it's an action romp with a retrofuture scifi setting. and that's extremely disappointing after witcher 3."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,falta que hagan 1000 parches ms pero es una experiencia visual muy hermosa.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,very different from promises cd project. and a lot of bugs in existing version.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the game pretend to be good linearstory lootershooter. it's not rpg game at all... we have open world city, but it is only mockup. it even doesn't react to player actions... we can exterminate all leaders of gangs, headquarter... but only what we change is enemy's presets on streets... side characters have good missions, but when we end hisher chain quest... than have max two line dialogue with occasionally sms. dialogue choice is grabbed from fallout 4 memes... with technically aspect vertical city looks good, but we can't go in building except story  mmolike  dungeon. we can forget about nonstory  nonbattle activities... it's only mockup. forget about your own v... forget about hard chioce like witcher 3... forget about life city like gta... forget about papergame cyberpunk creed... it's one shoot game with good story behind bugged, static city in lootershooter gameplay. it look's like, this game is caricature marriage worst dream about bethesda, bioware and blizzard with only one good writer in one game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i played the game on my computer, and i see that the story is great, beautiful story, strong characters, the graphics was epic , nice technical direction, great technical performance on the computer, at times, frames drop to happen, , some simple glitches , but in general, the performance was good for the pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i'm not sure i understand the many negative reviews users on pc have given this game. it is buggy, and imperfect. it's not quite what cdpr promised in some respects. but it is a fun and intriguing open world rpg. presumably the bugs will be fixed and the game will improve. i almost have to assume that many of the negative reviews from pc players are players running the game on a machine that barely makes the specs for the gameif your processor isn't up to the task, that can make npcs behave strangely as the cpu struggles to handle all the calculations necessary for the npc ai alongside all the other calculations going on in this game. and so for many of the other reported bugs or errors. whether the code can be optimized in such a way that lowerend processors can deal...well, we'll have to wait and see. now, none of this is to say that cdpr doesn't deserve some  for releasing a buggy mess. they shouldn't have done so. still, what they have released is a ridiculously welldetailed open world with thousands of little intriguing stories to be discovered, some great though notquiteawesome combat, cool though similarly notquiteawesome character development mechanics, and most importantly, an absolutely chilling vision of the future toward which we are all barrelling. reviews that have called the game world shallow, insipid, or intrusive have missed the entire point of the cyberpunk genre, and should go read some spider robinson, william gibson, and pat cadigan. in short is the game perfect? hell, no. is it worth the time and money? on pc, hell yes."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,just love it. it's one of the best idea for game ever! hopefully cdpr fix all bugs soon and all of that negative feedback will gone. it's masterpiece!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"not perfect but not nearly as bad as many are claiming. game runs smooth and looks great. combat system is solid, the driving system does  on muse and keyboard. might not quite live up to the hype but then again most games don't. a worth game if you enjoy open world and the cyberpunk genre."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i have had a blast playing this game. the story is super engaging and i hope they can iron out the bugs i know they will but people who want a perfect experience should wait 2 months before buying but i personally, i am loving it a lot."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"trash melee combat poor and boring gunplay the worse looting system i ever saw terrible inventory management terrible physics and movement  ai lazy cute design beautiful city and assets! at this point, the only thing that keeps me playing is laughing at the immense amount of funny bugs. please, don't fix the bugs, they're funnier than the actual game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the rpg mechanics continue on those of the witcher and expand on them. the random encounters, the complex lore and the intuitive storytelling all complement the players immersion into the world of cyberpunk 2077. some issues are present apart from the many bugs and performance issues that exist even on pc. levelling up doesnt feel that satisfying  instead of giving higher level ennemies some new mechanics"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"not very well made game, if you don't believe me, there's already 100's of videos on youtube about all of it's problems, bugs and missing features."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"don't waste your money on this broken game, it's worse than 2005 open world's, it's not a joke, i'm serious, this game is that bad."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"great rpg 810 with solid story and amazing characters, not 10 because story is really short. really crappy openworld and gameplay 210, buggy and repetitive. graphics and engine 510 sooooo blurry even with ultra settings and filmgrain off and textures are like from 2010. really sorry cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i played the game on for about 4 hrs or so. so, full disclosure i didn't play the entire game. but i didn't have to to ask for a refund. i felt i purchased an early access game without the label. i saw jarring glitches within the short period of time that i did play. i've actually played more polished early access games than what i played with cyperpunk. i cant recommend this game in its current state."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,great game. there will always be those who whine just about anything though .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i'm 50 hours in, i have not finished the game. positive looks gorgeous. good story. pretty good framerates at a decent performance setting on an older 1080 card. i have had plenty of fun playing. i do like sneaking! and you can almost always avoid killing people if you want so that's a fair plus. the world is deeply and immersively realised. it feels livedin and real. negative buggy mess. mostly little bugs. major bug, one weapon glitch preventing you using weapons that was showstopping until i read up how to get out of it on the internet. medium bug, quest door that would not open if approached from the back entrance to a building, only if you go through the front, lots of minor glitching. has not crashed on me though. i said a good story, but it isn't 'epic' like the witcher series games. too much like a lesser grand theft auto. combat doesn't feel that inspired to me, maybe i am doing it wrong. too many generic side quests. this brings the score down a lot for me. in witcher 3 i did the sidequests because i wanted to find out what happened. even if they'd gone grey and were worth no xp. these side quests are terribly generic 'go here kill this cyberpsycho', 'go there steal that car'. generic, boring. makes it feel grindy. the story mission is pretty great though and 'some' sidequests also have that cdpr flair to them. 6 for being buggy, 8 if it was polished. buggy is never acceptable. its a good game, but i recommend waiting until they polish it up and the price drops a bracket or two."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"gtx1060 6gb, i78750h, 16 gb ram. totally unplayable. disgusting optimization. average fps below 30 with a lot of drops and game crashes. and that's on low settings, definitely not worth to buy at the moment"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i think it really depends on what machine you're playing this game on. i 100 agree that the game is undercooked even on pc but it does not deserve a score below 7. story and characters are great, environment is very immersive, music is awesome. you can see the amount of hard work that went into this game. however, a tons of bugs b npcs are just so dumb that it breaks immersion sometimes. cdpr please please please don't release a half cooked product ever again and i'm hoping you'll patch things up soon!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"game is actually pretty damn good, yet it is short and it is about 35 hours story mode, with side story it could go to 50 hours and if you really squeeze the game it can go to 70 hours, this 70 hours is full of action, story, and quality. if you don't have a monster pc i don't recommend to play it right now because it really is buggy yet there are a lot of updates coming for it, best game of 2020 easily btw"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"o jogo em si  bom, porm,  apenas mais um jogo bom. no  aquele jogo que faz diferena na minha galeria de jogos,  apenas mais um que eu gostei de jogar. no h nada de realmente inovador ou que faa ser uma experincia revolucionria, alm de no ter diversas funes prometidas durante o desenvolvimento do game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i get that it's a horrible game on last gen consoles but on pc, it's fine if you have a current graphics card. the world is vibrant and full of hidden secrets. can it be improved? yes...i play on a ultrawide and the menus don't support it but everything else is fine...minor annoyance...there is the usual graphical  i still find myself wanting more and more...i understand we love to complain as humans but please, understand the depth of this game and what the devs were trying to  we cancel cdprojectred then what's left? i'm still torn at how the community destroyed mass efffect andromeda and cancelled them...facial animations be damned it was a fine game...alas, i get this game is buggy and it was prematurely released but we gotta give the devs a  money hungry higher ups rushed the devs and forced the game out but let's consider the devs who actually created this game for us...they mean well..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"a hollow, broken experience. i had really high hopes for this game, but it's just plagued by issues. first issues with fps, i find this is an issue with all amd processors. this should not have shipped in that state. 2nd numerous visual bugs. put on hat, look in mirror in the first 20 minutes or so of the game now i have no hair at all. wth? not to mention a weird naked man that would appear on the back of my bike randomly 3rd poor ai, literally have seen enemies phase in and out of existence, and the ai is awful. i had to turn the difficulty in the game to near max for a semienjoyable experience. other issues abound, lifeless feeling npcs, very poor romance options, and for a game that was hyped as wearing it's sexuality on it's face, it does a very poor job of the racy content. oh a flash of breast, how risque. the witcher felt more adult than this game does. romance options for characters are also really lacking. if they were going to go this poor on the development i'd prefer they went the outer worlds route and left them out entirely. this is no man's sky all over again, and i can only hope they do the same thing they did with that game, and work their ass off to redeem themselves and come up with an actual finished product. they currently do not have one. i ignored most of these issues, and i was still having an okay time, despite speccing accidentally into a build that was absolutely broken who thought it was a good idea to have a sniper rifle that shoots and sees through walls? the balancing in this game is very poor. then i find out there is literally a game breaking time bomb bug just waiting to destroy your savegames on pc. your save gets over 8mb? congratulations your save file is corrupted. no fixing it, you should just restart at this point. i can overlook a lot, but as my savegame playing through normal means using the crafting system is rapidly approaching 7mb, and their response so far has been they are looking at it, and might fix it, that was too far. when buying a game that costs 60 i expect a polished, relatively bug free, experience. one or two, no big deal, as long as the company is going to fix them. this kind of bug is absolutely unacceptable in a aaa release. to contrast another game i have hundreds of hours on acodyssey, i encountered maybe 2 bugs in my entire playthrough, and certainly my game was never in danger of just breaking. this was a known issue in the witcher 3 as well, so it's not like they had no idea this was going to happen. they chose to release the game in this state. should they fix that, i'd say the game is probably worth around 35 tops. this is not a 60 quality release. i'd save my money for a sale if i were you. with the savegame bug still a problem, i wouldn't buy it at any price. this is the first time i've ever requested a refund for a game, but it simply isn't in a state where it should have been released."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"this is a pc review and like most i have come across bugs with my play thru. the most annoying was the ingame mission bugs where to progress you need to scan items but for whatever reason they don't scan properly, just make sure to save and reload often. also, during some of the braindance missions press x to process to the next scene. these were the most annoying bugs that hampered my game play. now, besides the bugs, the game is completely unbalanced, example i was able to get my handgun to hit for 50k however it is fun to experience. if your looking for a shooter, while not really interested in crafting or storyline then do not buy this game, it is not boarderlands in any shape or form. if your interested in all the elements  this is an amazing experience. very few games capture and maintain my interest fully, even less games have i found myself attached to the characters. to me the acting, music, sound are top notch. missions seemed to be done well and felt slightly different then most boring quests, i appreciate the team for that and can tell it took time. to be honest i found myself trying to find unique gear, scattered throughout the game and then blowing heads off. if your into mass effect, fallout, the witcher, i'm sure you'll get a kick out of this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"it's just bad open world game compared to any aaa modern open world from past 15 years. watch dogs games, gta games, sleeping dogs games, all of these are better than cyberpunk 2077."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the best game i have ever played from the perspective of the main campaign and the side quest and gigs. with 40 hours of gameplay, this game has taken a cyberpunk backdrop and crafted truly engaging human stories in slums and the boonies. when thought of as an onrails rpg, you understand what the game is trying to be a vector for telling personal stories that are genuinely entertaining. the most cinematic game i have played that largely stays in the 1st person perspective. it also doesn't hurt that the game is actually fun to play. in our cyberpunk dystopian world, it is refreshing that this game doesn't try to milk you for all you got."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"very unimpressed overall, and i love anything cyberpunk usually. the story is actually pretty cool and interesting, i also like the soundtrack a fair bit. graphics are good, but nothing that really blew me away, especially characters. my biggest issue is the fact that night city looks great but feels empty. npcs are incredibly dumb and their reaction just not acceptable in 2020. the ai for the police is not much better, and let's not get started on physics. combat is clunky but passable, but enemies are just bullet sponges, i just feel there's not much to that game really., and nothing nextgen. disappointment is an understatement."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"cyberpunk 2077, for me, bugs reduce comfort and immersion enough to affect the evaluation of the game, but not enough to completely negate what cp does well. at least on pc, the game is strong 7.5  10, but i think that if not for bugs that spoil the immersion the more serious ones, for example, the wanted system, whole ncpd and ones that forces you to reload game. i would give 8, maybe 910, but i would not give 10  10 no matter what they do, openworld games, whatever it is, always suffer from the same ailment, a huge map that is hard to fill with enough interesting activities to do, so it is patched with  gtastyle clogs, monotonous and repetitive. cdp at least tried to add a story to each of the many extra activities but they are still rather weak and boring, i did them all and somewhere in the middle i stopped paying attention to the circumstances of these events, just go and kill everything that shoots at you. at the moment i have over 95 hours in the game and i'm at the end of main story quests."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i have been playing both watchdogs 2014 and cyberpunk 2077 2020 whole week just to compare these two. i think everyone can agree unless you hate hacking, that overall watchdogs 2014 is better openworld game than cyberpunk 2077 2020. keep in mind that watchdogs came out 6 years ago. it has better police system. npc's on streets feel alive, they actually react to you, they don't just disappear. city in watchdogs 2014 feels alive. i know that up to taste, but to me watchdogs has fun missions, specially in dlc. while cyberpunk has endless amounts of text and only half of it is maybe interesting. by the way i'm talking about watchdogs pc version obviously where you can activate all the effects, etc. it doesn't look as good as e3 trailer, but for a 2014 game, it actually still looks very good. and this comments is not to promote watchdogs, i'm just doing simple comparison between two games and taking into consideration that watchdogs came out 6 years ago. so in reality cyberpunk 2077 should be miles ahead of watchdogs, but it's not. not even close. so yeah, i think it's very clear that in terms of openworld modern city, watchdogs is better openworld game than cyberpunk 2077 and i think that just shows how bad state cyberpunk 2077 is in."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"cyberpunk 2077 story is amazing, the story is what kept me playing it the hole time. video games, movies, comic books etc. are about the story and how good is it to keep the audience engaged, to want to come back to it, to want more, to be curious what is going to happen next. and cyberpunk 2077 did that for me with flying colors. the game is not perfect, bad decisions where made and the pressure from the community didn't help. overall the experience was ok to put it bluntly, bugs where present like all the games that launch till now from big companies. if you want to play i recommend to wait 2 more months for the big updates. now only time can tell if this will be the next model for next gen games or the model for how not to. i hope for the better!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"would love to love it, but seeing as the game crashes before even launching, leaving me with a60 .exe file to generate crash reports for cdpr, i really can't."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i played this game on an original ps4 and had a good experience. i beat the main story in 20 hours and did a few side quests as well. the reported bugs were present but they did not come close to ruining the game for me. it crashed a couple of time, frames would drop during auto saves, textures would pop in  generally only when i exited a vehicle after driving 130 mph. it would forget all of the custom settings i created every time i closed the game. ultimately, i just played on easy to make up for that but the gameplay really wasn't the driving factor of my enjoyment, anyway. all in all, none of the glitches seemed any worse than any other open world game that wasn't made by rockstar. this game executed dialogue options better than any other rpg. your choices affect character interactions, side quest availability, and endings. the dialogue choices, also, carry continuity. you aren't an ahole to a character just to turn around and be able to romance them. even with all of this variability the voice acting is still mostly well performed in all situations. the cinematic sequences are well executed, especially for a fps. they feel a lot like half life cut scenes but the acting was a little worse than horizon zero dawn. however, the developers had to record many, many different iterations for every interaction because of how important your choices are. therefore, i lowered my normal expectations for acting. overall, this is probably the most ambitious game of all time. it didn't quite live up to hype that cdpr created for it but it definitely exceeds the quality of other entries in this genre."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"when in a game full of neons and beautiful lighting actions you get the feeling you did a good thing to build your own desktop for the future is a feeling that you never forget friend. cyberpunk is an astonishing rpg that should be more likely to seem as a witcher of the forcible anotherdimension. game has something from fallout too but it's nothing we have all seen in till yet. 80h game you need to give the sidequests a chance they are extremely well written of gun blazing, shooting or either stabbing, hacking, becoming an antihero thing. btw the photo mode is briliant!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the game delivers an incredible atmosphere, i don't think anyone can disagree on that. the characters you're following, the city in which everything takes place is by design a masterpiece. however the beauty of the city is just a facade. hidden behind that is a lifeless feeling that you wouldn't have expected from a studio like cdpr. sure some scripted districts feel alive, but the general open world experience does not. you can increase the population density as much as you like, but your game will never reach the desired alive feeling that a game like rdr2 has. the soundtrack is really impressive. it sets up the tone perfectly. the characters and their writing and voice acting is superb. easily my favorite part of the game. this game lacks serious core gameplay mechanics. everything from the gear system, customization, the quickhacking, the character progress through skill trees etc. everything is so incredibly lackluster. it feels as if they only put the bare minimum of work into these major factors. i finished the game at around level 27. i did the major side quests and a few things here and there. 70, if not more of the skill tree is left unexplored for me because of how hard it is to level. you really have to grind side activities to get that skill tree going. a lot of the skill tree is uninteresting though. same goes with the weapons. i mostly stuck to playing revolver with a silencer and a sniper or something as a main weapon. i wasn't a fan of the tech or smart technology. quickhacks felt meaningless. didn't see a point in them when i could just take out dozens of enemies in stealth with my revolver alone. even watch dogs did this better and if ubisoft did something better than you.. well sorry to say but you messed up. i could go on and talk about the atrocious ai and the non existent trafficpolice system. but enough people have already done that. i don't know what went wrong with this game. it really shouldn't have been released for another year at least. sorting out all the bugs and fleshing out the system more would have made this game so so much better. i'm sure i will revisit the game in the future. i hope that they fixed some of the issues by then. probably not though"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"this is basically a nvidia tech demo with a very very linear open world game dropped onto it. that's the tl dr this game is not the next gen deus ex we wanted. i've played 52 hours and completed the main story and all side missions. i have not bothered to replay on different life paths because being a corpo on my main playthrough had negligible impact to the game. you can drive.. you can do missions, you can do side missions, and that's it. those are the three main things you do in cyberpunk. there are no extra activities, mini games, or anything resembling a nonlinear experience. the mission system allows a choice of stealth or all out guns blazing.. there are very few dynamic mission choices that allow you to solve problems in your own way. i can't blackmail an npc into giving me the objective because in a previous mission i found evidence of them doing something nasty. that kind of continuity does not exist in cyberpunk's world. the most i can do is make decisions which lead down linear paths. often the same path with an inconsequential alteration frankly. unlike deus ex or similar games, i can't talk my way past a guard or npc, i can't disguise myself and blag my way into a lounge to steal the objective. i can't choose to steal the objective from the transport it's in or something like that. i can't open a sewer grate and sneak under the building to come up inside the place etc. there are almost never alternative approaches to a mission. it's just a straight linear experience. it's always blast your way in or sneak in, and fetch something. on the subject of npcs, you can go and talk to an npc but they just spout a canned one line response. why can't i have a conversation with them? that has been done in so many rpgs even dating back to games in the 80s. you should be able to talk to npcs and have a basic branching dialogue. it really should not have been difficult to do this. there is no player customization, the items you pick up in game are very lack luster for the most part. there is one badass gun that johnny has and when you finally get it they  nerf it on you. what a  killjoy. it's not a living, breathing world where an npc will remember your face and throw you out of a club. there are many interesting locations in the world and you visit them once for a single generic mission. inside those places there is typically nothing. no interesting items or things to interact with, just nice decorum if you're lucky. often the design of bars or places is very confusing and poorly signed so you'll end up racing from room to room trying to find this chip. picking up items is a nightmare they will probably never patch because i'd say it has to be fixed per item which would be a monumental task. the game was clearly far too ambitious and they were forced to release it once they had the graphics and story done because people wanted roi. well.. jokes on those people a good portion of sales are getting refunded now and i certainly will not be rushing to buy the next game. i'll wait for reviews and reactions next time. i can only pray they have content lined up for this game because it genuinely is a massive let down if the only thing it has is this johnny story. i love keanu reeves too but i did not expect the entire game to revolve around his story in the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"final edit at the end! made this account just for the review of this due to the sheer amount of hate this game is getting. i cannot understand why and how people set the expectations for a game so high that it is even more hyped up than the fking second cuming of jesus. it is not the most groundbreaking game ever, it has bugs definitely but we also have to keep in mind where this game is coming from. tw3 was the first big game for cdpr, they have done nothing like it before just look at the first two witcher games and then imagine to completely change your style from medieval fantasy to retrofuturistic. i bet it wasn't the easiest project in their life and imho the game could have been longer in development, at least 12 years but also imagine the outrage mob going after the devs with death threats and the usual i am consumer i want now  the game is good everything that says anything different plays on console or has either a  pc or unreal expectations and should evaluate his priorities anew, which i think is the problem here. i say 810 i love this game so far starting with the driving and ending on just farming stupid gang mobs around the city. the story is good and engaging so far and i bet it keeps on coming. with future patches and updates this game will be a gem and i personally trust in cdpr even though they are corpo and did with their game what everyone does in the game. sell it.. on that note c ya in night city and don't try to get your brains fried  edit finished the game now and i am slightly more disappointed than before. 20h in before now 60 and yeah.... what to say? the ending is rather underwhelming... wherein 2 of them are basically the same endings with slight differences on the way to it... also as some others probably realized while playing they completely forgot that there is basically 0 level of customization outside of clothing, which imho isn't that bad as some people say.. if a combo looks  then don't wear it. i didn't cause nobody forced me to and 2 points of armor more? please got other problems.. dunno what to say... just came out of all the endings and i feel weird... it is at it's current state a 610 max..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"this is the most disappointing release i can think of in the last 5 years. so much promised content is missing, and while on pc i did not get any of the game breaking bugs console users are getting, i still got a lot of minor bugs which ruin any rpg element there is in the game. and that's the primary reason for my low score, the game looks beautiful, the city is amazing and in terms of art design is the most detailed i've seen. but that's where the sense of awe ends, because when you actually go out to explore the city, you find there is pretty much nothing to do. you can't even sit on a bench in a park. the quests that are finished are good, but there are many which are clearly after thoughts added in to rush the game out. even questlines that appear finished are missing content. i romanced panam and as soon as the climax of the romance happened its like her character turned off. going to see her in the aldecados camp offers only 3 conversation options. there's no further interaction with her until if you chose to ask her for help at the end of the game. its such a shame, there's a great game hiding in there somewhere, but all the cut or simply unfinished content and minor bugs completely ruin it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"2 or 3 years now, to wait for a game with a great potency... now its ready to play.. but.. first of all the graphic is amazing... but this is all this game can do... i read something like a masterpiece and other  please tell me what in this game is a masterpiece? the story is ..ehm... what story ? just following quests like gta san andreas but without a main character story... driving a car is completely whack.. gameplay is just a 90s doom 2... its more like a movie.. but a movie with no story and bad actors and a bs synchronisation... completely fail this game... and than this hype... looool waste of time and waste of money... i played the pc version!!!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"in cyberpunk 2077 you experience a very well written story in a pretty setting, which unfortunately remains absolutely inaccessible and boring. several examples people who are rescued just stop. the dont even thank the player. if you commit a crime the police simply spawn around you. the night city residents just tell the player all the time that they don't feel like talking. they don't have a daily routine, some just walk around, others stand in their shops forever. slot machines, etc. are not interactive. the cars drive on set routes. if something is in the way, they just stay behind it. nobody even tries to avoid the obstacle. that is not an immersive city. that is a very boring surrounding. i am very disappointed."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"so the main marketing pitch for this game that i have seen on multiple sites is explore night city, where the choices you make shape the story and the world around you the world does not shape at all. completely misleading. whether you are at 1 main story and side jobs completed or 99 main story and side jobs completed, the world is the exact same. plus boring. if you're not doing a mission, you're not doing anything. the story shapes a tiny bit, but not more so than many other games. doesn't justify it being the main pitch of the game. the story is also really short. all this put together, boring open world, short main story, actually very little player impact, and you end up with a mediocre game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"what an utter peice of garbage this game is. i got to act 3 and just couldn't take the crap gameplay anymore. gunplay is seriously garbage, you can shoot people in the face repeatedly and their health bar barely moves. so gunfights end up with some enemies just being bullet sponges for you to be 2 hit killed. driving is a chore with the poor physics and poor ai drivers. it's so bad you end up just running or walking everywhere. key binds that cannt be edited leaving left handers scrambling to press f to interact etc or unable to rebind to the enter key on the keypad. a storyline that has you being a  why do all these games like gta, rdr2 etc think everyone wants to be a ? a largle lifeless city with crap ai and poor quests. i mean you get random quests that put you into positions where you end up rage quitting at the poor gunplay balance. or you play the main questline where practically every decision you make ends up on rails. for example know you are walking into an ambush, but you have to do it or the quest will not progress. trigger cut scene where suddenly one shot kills everyone, yet the same gun barely caused a paper cut in the recent gunfight you just had to run away from. the inventory is unintuitive and just a chore to work through and it's the same for the buggy journalquest system where you track all over the city to reahc your destination to find there was a preqrequsite they didn't tell you about in the quest description. then there are the random bugs that should not be making it inot final release. like cars and other items that just float. very overhyped peice of  grahpically decent but certainly not close to next gen in any way. gameplay is poor queststoryline is poor subjective controls and keybinding setup is poor i simply couldn'ta take any more after maybe 7 hours of playing. i can't give this a zero but any more than 2 or 3 is generous."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the game came out with a lot of technical problems, bugs, friezes, poor optimization, but from the plot side, the game was able to lure me for many tens of hours, thanks for that. if at least some of the technical errors are corrected, i will put the score higher."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i did all the endings, most of side missions and i can finally give a review. in my case game had a few bugs here and there but not game breaking. the story kept me excited, the characters are very colorful and interesting. the climat of the game is very nice and rinding of vehicles kept me in the game just to ride through the night city without a purpose. but the thing that is the worst i ever witnessed was ai. police spawning at your back, npc only being able to do 1 line after you talk to them and the only thing they do is either run or crouch when you shoot at something. also when you scare them look away from them they just dissapear. i understand the community is angry because of missleading but i made my review based on the game not the launch of it. the game isnt that bad. im being serious. the only thing i never used was crafting because its basicly useless. i hope my review is helpfull."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"awful. nevermind bugs and technical issues, it's just a bad game. it's almost all dialogues and cutscenes, and when you actually get to do something, it's terrible. gunplay and driving is awful, rpg elements and character development are lackluster. it's a bad game, no amount of bugfixing and optimization will make it any more fun to play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"phenomenal game, well worth stomaching a few bugs! big props to cdprojekt for delivering such a masterpiece. realistically, more like a 910, but rating it a 10 to offset the console peasant hate."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"yes, the game still has a few bugs and is missing a few convenience features. but these are all things that can and will be patched. it is a diamond in the rough. behind it is a masterpiece that is second to none. night city alone is a work of art like no other in the gaming landscape. every corner is unique, oraganic and creatively designed. sure, things could have been done better, more interactivity, etc., but it's not a gta, it's a roleplaying game. and what is important there, the quests, they do everything right. there are no better ones on the market. anyone who can wait, should wait for a few patches, but i regret so far not a minute of over 60 hours."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,this is one of the most innovative games i've played in quite some time. i play on stadia and it has been an amazing experience that dovetails nicely with the overall theme of the game. thanks for an excellent adventure.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"no spoilers. i like the game, it's got lots to do but you have to play a bit. in the beggining i felt weak but slowly got stronger. always have a melye weapon. forget the hype or the negativity, on pc its a top tier game. p. s. a zero review score makes you look irrelevant. so here's a 10 to counter a bit. game is abt a 8.5 to 9 on pc for me so far."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i am truly disappointed to see the unrealistic feedback and ideas that cp2077 is being measured against. it is not being measured against what exists in terms of gaming worlds or openworld rpgs. in short, if you want a true openworld immersive game that exceeds any other option out there, this is that game. night city, the acting, the graphics, and the rpg system are done very well second to none. cp2077 is this generation's deus ex. period. note i am playing on an i9 10900k and rtx 3090. i have seen a few bugs in 25 hours of playthrough. nothing gamebreaking and mostly not worth the mention it is getting. i have also played it on stadia, which also worked very well. if you are looking for a mature the game is 18 for a reason, immersive openworld rpg that is true to the source material. this is the best game of the decade. it exceeds witcher 3 also great and rdr2 if the source material appeals to you. i can only assume that people do not understand what it takes to make a game of this caliber or are trying to generate clicks through sensationalism. cdprojekt red's team has done a great job and deserves their bonuses and none of the reviewsadolescent feedback hitting youtube and the press."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,beautiful game but feels unfinished and somewhat unpolished. lots of glitches. nothing i would say game breaking but just a lot of clipping and just random crap. also it is very hard on the gpu. running it on a rtx 2080 super manually overclocked i can manage maybe an average of 40 fps on high settings and 1440p. if cdpr can fix the bugs and optimize the game i think is still has the potential to be one of the best games ever. story is great and game play is fun. i do wish the city itself was a little more alive. lots of npcs but very little interactions outside of the scripted events. i think the game was rushed out unfinished. they should have learned from bethesda and fallout 76 and known how bad an idea that is.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"upfront i am playing on stadia, so i am getting bugfree 4k60hz even on my chromebook. the game is fantastic  the environment is huge, immersive, fluid and persistent. i've not seen a city scape of this magnitude come to life in a video game ever. the ai characters in the city are modeled just right, imho  they couldn't care less about you and will brush you off if you try to talk, which is very much like real world city experiences are  the graphics are absolutely phenomenal. character rendering like we used to only see in dead or alive, detailled and lifelike. the city scape matches this in quality, with different districts having their own character and no copypaste look. i keep just staring at things. the story is really rich and fascinating. i won't go into spoilery details, but arguably this is the most interesting aspect of the game  i could see writing large scale dlcs for the engine being a great way to continue the franchise. there are some bugs i've encountered, but all of them had easy fixes. nowhere near what the level of complaints from older consoles seems to indicate. i am not the greatest fan of the soundtrack, but arguably that's the least important aspect of the game. overall, i am having fun and am playing more compulsively than i probably should. just know that the platform you're playing on might negatively impact your experience. personally, this is the first time i've found the stadia experience to be a major upside. the critical reception imho is flawed  i've played every large single player rpg on xbox, pc and playstation for the last decade, and this one is breaking new ground and compares favorably to all of them."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the game is phenomenal. the sheer amount of negative reviews stem from mostly people who can't play the game due to lastgen considerations. here's what people don't understand, ps4 and xbox one x players had the chance to upgrade, for free, to the nextgen copy of the game once they upgraded. i firmly believe that cdpr was delaying as long as possible because they were hoping that the nextgen console push would carry most of the attention away from lastgen issues however, covid19, and production delays, impacted in ways we would not have foreseen. as such, it's almost impossible to get a ps5xbox series x for the holiday season. therefore, more people ended up going with lastgen copies of the game than i think they anticipated. had the roll out of the nextgen consoles gone smoother, i think there would be less negative press around this game. regardless, as a pc player, there comes a time and point where you play a game that makes you realize it's time to upgrade. console users have never had to deal with this issue  until now. should they not have developed crossgen platforms? probably. still, don't let these launch issues take away from the fact the game is a combination of some of the greatest concepts out there. far too many comparisons to grand theft auto have left people feeling underwhelmed. for me, i see this as the division meets tarkov with elements of an open world sandbox game. would people's expectations be different had grand theft auto never released? sure! however, to compare a aaa studio with an indie studio  it's impressive to see a team like cdpr swing so high above their weightclass. lets give them the respect they deserve and acknowledge that launch issue bugs will be patched the game can only get better from here."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the game is bugged  it is not up for discussion. however, if someone judges a single player game by its technical issues, cyberpunk is not for him, at least not today. the game has a very interesting story, many interesting mechanics that make the game not boring, lots of side activities, wellwritten characters, an amazing city where you can lose yourself while traveling around its nooks and crannies. most importantly, however, cd projekt red will eventually fix this game, optimize it, and it will be a real masterpiece. let's be honest, almost every highend game is released in a bad condition and then repaired over the years or not at all, and they often don't have the positive things that cd projekt red can boast of. i think it's a very good game with too early release issues. people's problem is that expectations like to grow for years and are never satisfied in the end."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i wish i could give this game a 9 or a 10, but i cant honestly do that. i am playing this game on one of the most powerful gaming computers available yet the game still constantly bugs out. the graphics are breathtaking and the story is equally so, but the bugs and glitches are so constant and so miserable that it completely breaks the immersion. one glitch causes the game to stutter so violently that i invariably have to shut the game down and restart it every 15 minutes. another glitch displays my character asserting the infamous dominant tpose, also every 15 minutes. yet another glitch causes bags of trash around me to spontaneously explode, hilarious at first, but miserable the 50th time. the glitches listed above are just a small sampling of the shockingly awful situation on full display in this game. mind you, this is on a 3,000 custom built gaming rig. it gets even worse if you are playing ps4 or xbox. dont expect a aaa experience from this supposedly aaa game, because you wont get one for this and other reasons. as far as gameplay, the story is fun and so are the characters. or at least it would be, if the developers didnt deliberately pack as much smut into it as they possibly could so they can jam it right down your throat at every possible moment. for example, there are salacious billboard adds that automatically play pretty much everywhere you go in the game. one has a woman moaning so loudly and so obnoxiously that i cant take shooting bad guys even the least bit seriously. on a more ugly note, an entire mission is devoted to literally nailing a guy to a cross to crucify him as a public spectacle. there are more wtf inducing moments in this game, but that should give you some idea of what to expect. after an initial 510 hours of excellent storyline, everything begins to feel hollow and pointless, struggling to even care. cd project red, what in the hell were you thinking? you had almost 10 whole years of development and a golden opportunity here, and you blew it. nobody wants to be bombarded with smut for a whole 40 hours of storydriven narrative and nobody wants to be your personal betatesting guinea pigs so that you can lazily iron out all the bugs after you release the whole game to the public. i give this game a miserable and sadly well deserved 610. it could have been so much more. buy this game only when it goes on a major discount or raise your pirate flag on this one."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"preordered the game in aug 2019. been a follower and fan way before then. i completed and loved both witcher 1 and 2 games. when i finished witcher 3  it was so good that i felt like i've lost a really close friend after the last quest was completed... what a masterpiece that is. it's on top of the best games i've ever played, so obviously, i was looking forward to cyberpunk 2077 and was ready to wait for as long as it was going to take. i am now 50 hours in and probably halfway through the main story, been doing loads of side quests and exploring, looking for the game that we were all promised. heartbroken, i just couldn't find it, cyberpunk 2077 is not what it could have  should have been. it's not about if you likeenjoy the game. it's about cdpr promising one game, taking preorders and delivering a completely different game. this game is missing so many promised features it's unrecognisable. almost no one cares about the bugs either, but we really should! are your standards really that low? wouldn't you be more happy if the developer would actually test and release the game when it's ready and not just because it's golden hour of the year to get most money? then scramble to fix it later? they lied to sony and microsoft about the state of the game on the current gen consoles. it's simply fraud. if you like the game as it is,  great! but please, just take a step back and understand that this game you love is only 510 of what it was meant to be, you're basically denying yourself an even better game by kissing cdprs buttocks and saying that they did a good job. they didn't. due to a galore of bugs that break the immersion every 5 minutes  i have decided to stop playing it for now and would not recommend you to spend money on it... at least not yet... now, wait! if you trust that cdpr will promptly fix it  remember that you have already trusted them to release the game that was going to be amazing in april 2020!!! i can't even begin to imagine how broken the game was a year ago. it seems that what initially maybe started as a true passiondriven project with the intent to make one of the bests open world rpg games ever  soon became a cash grabber for the marketing team. hype dispenser was on full blast and we sure did fell for it... v is on tight rails. i started as a nomad. the first bug  i'm looking at the mirror and i'm clearly not wearing a west. the game gives me one option 1!!!  remove the bakkers clan badge from the west i'm not wearing. one button press later  suddenly i'm wearing a west, and i have no choice but to remove the badge. later i wonder if things could have gone differently in the game if i was given an option to keep it?. the mechanic then tells me that i need to spend more money than expected to fix the car which i'm about to use for a smuggling operation. v, being the aggressive choomba that he is  takes matters into his own hands and fixes the car himself. the car fails to start straight away but conveniently works just fine two more tries later and performs just as new for the rest of the mission. makes me wonder  what if i was given a choice? what if v fixing the car would have meant that midmission, at a critical point, it would have not started? made my gameplay completely different from what could have happened if i was given an option to pay extra money to this mechanic? this is not next gen game they advertised. after the first mission is over you get about a minutelong montage of how you became friends with jackie  6 months later... really? you are telling me that there was no way i could have actually done all of those missionsactivities together with jackie and felt like i became friends with him? just saying... witcher 3 was all about hard choices that had real consequences where cyberscam 2020 is all about fake bling. the traffic, police, and npcs are all just a mirage. none of them are really there. the truman show. the world can be beautiful if you have good hardware to back it up, i'll give them that, but at the same time, it's also dead. when i talked to npcs on the street they never mentioned anything about what happened during my quests. none of the characters commented on my choice to spare lives or just murder 50 guards with a machine gun. fixers force missions on to you, and you don't even meet most of them in person before they do. invisible walls for vehicles  everywhere!! i could go on, but it's just another mediocre openworld game in the early beta stage. this multibillion company lied to you and you should not take it lightly. spend few minutes on the internet and research how they have mistreated their developers. watch some youtube videos of cyberpunk 2077 bug compilations. cdpr had a good thing going for them, but they've decided to cash out. vote with your wallet, ask for a refund if you can. please, do it for better games. do it for your future self."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the bugs and performance can be fixed, not a problem, the rest is not. the game is not even cyberpunk, the buildings, weapons, clothes, and music are pretty common in 2020, except for the cars, the vehicles are from 1970. ia i haven't seen such an stupid ia since borderlands 1, but it fits the style, here it looks pitty.  in skyrim if i punch a guard, everyone wants me dead, here i throw a grenade in the middle of a crowd and everyone scares for a minute and then they walks like nothing happened, the police never arrives. fighting style 20 headshots with a shotgun or 1 slash with a katana, you choose.  the same movement style in halo 1 from 20 years ago. story like any cheap hollywood movie.  the first 6 hours are entertaining at least, after that is just garbage.  not spoiling, but the bugs ruined most of the sad scenes, very funny btw. the lifepaths nothing to do with the trailers, not spoiling. customization very, very, very limited options, like a joke compared to other games. the loot like borderlands but without the style, a lot of crap, you can have like 100 pistols in your bag, whats the difference? the stats, numbers, meaningless. the body modifications again, just numbers, they didn't learned a thing from crysis or deus ex.  oh, you want that hyper mega expensive skin mod? bang! 0.2 of armour, that's all. welp, i hope they hurry up with the refund."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"an absolutely mediocre product that has nothing new to offer in the cyberpunk setting. the plot is medium with uninteresting endings, the gameplay is like in far cry boring and a lot of marks on the map with boring miniquests. shooting is average. the melee combat system is poor with poor and meager animations. there is no rpg system, almost all your skills for pumping are passive skills. nonlinearity is absent in 99 of cases. oh yes a huge number of bugs, lags, and all this is covered by poor optimization. ps players  don't get discouraged by losing the game, because the game is crap for the general public."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,this game is one big lie. they delivered a steaming pile of cooked bugs. the world is lifeless plastic mold filled with bugs and glitches. even on midhigh end pcs. everything is boring. npcs are glued to the floor or moving around like bugs on cocaine. you cant really interact with anything or anyone. the only thing you can do to an npc is to kill them and than tons of cops will magically teleport on your exact location on blast you off in a second. tons of filler repetitive tasks and quests. nothing is exciting or interesting. not even the main quest. customization is useless. crafting is useless. cars are useless. perks and skills? you guessed it  useless. you can just shoot you way trough every quest with gazillions of guns you constantly pick up from the floor and it wont make a difference. no reason to be a hacker or stealth ninja  its not even satisfying  you do the same 2 animations quickhacks over and over again... next thing  key bindings  they are hard locked and you cant change them. the only way to change some of them is to mess with the game and save files. yeah this game is so advanced you cant even change your controls. i stopped playing 6 hours in. there are 2d platformers more full of life than this rpg. just let it die. like mass effect andromeda.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"imagine expecting a game of this magnitude with breathtaking visuals ultra graphics with ray tracing on, jesus christ it looks good. best looking gam,e ever made and a huge open world with so much detail would run well on a 7 year old console that wasn't even cutting edge back when it was released. i'm glad they didn't compromise their vision so those old pieces of  could run it, if they did us who aren't poor and have good gaming pc's would have received a lesser product. 1010 best game ever made"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"great story, music and visuals. midicore ai, fighting and driving. a lot of bugs and failing the expectation of goty. overhyped game with ton of bugs and great plot that i still really enjoy. with all this problems it has i can't give it more than 8."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"as usual, don't listen to the haters. does this game has problems? yes, as any game this big did and will have at release. but if you actually play this game yourself you probably will find it much better as many of this reviews make it to be."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"cyberpunk 2077 could have been a so great game but it stopped in its meh state. its definitely not one of the best in its genre, also due to expectations raised by its developers the feel was quite underwelming. 90 of the choices taken by the player are irrelevant to the story itself and there are so few ending paths that just feel sad. the only good architectured quest are just the first the one that got spammed everywhere to promote the game and the last due to narration climax, in between there's an empty shell that is really disappointing. also there are serious incoherency issues from start the player cannot in any way modify v'body appeal not even the hairstyle."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"i have just believed in that world and story. can drive hours and hours in my car and admire the beauty of that big, living city. as a pc player i havent encountered any major bugs so i cant complain on that issue. i have been waiting for a long time to play so polished rpg game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the game is not worth the wait at all. clearly go through the storyline and end there, there is nothing unusual in the plot, the characters do not cause compassion because you simply do not have time to become attached to them. the world around is dead from the word at all. you are given the opportunity to create a character, but then, during the game, they are not given the slightest opportunity to change at least a hairstyle. the form in which it came out suggests only the idea that it was whipped up for money and nothing more. as a result, you can go through the plot, and then delete the game and not have the slightest desire to return there"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"how do i even start to write this... i feel sad and sorry for all the people that have worked very hard on this game. they do not deserve this. they've been pressured, exploited, manipulated and many of them being paid far below what they should have been paid. whoever iswas in charge at cd project sad should be ashamed of themselves. a prosperous game company. winning many awards. gaining a lot of fame and money in the last decade. and this is how you treat the people that work for you? this is how you treat your customers? this is how you lie to and deceit sony and microsoft? greed does weird and ugly things to people, to cooperations... i could go on a lot longer, but they're not worth any more of my energy and time to be frank."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"very bad amateurish video game, extremely buggy and lots of promised features are missing. this game had one of the worst false marketing ever. promoted as next generation of open world games and released only when it's ready in a trailer that tried to copy gta 5 trailer. this game is worse than anything ubisoft has ever done. in fact, ubisoft is really good game developer compared to cdprojectred."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"this is a very immersive open world game that really sets the mood of being in a dystopian cyberpunk world. despite the bugs and some cut contents, i really feel that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. the game has a lot of potential and would expect to even get better in due time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"what an absolute shame. there is a lot of potential here but it's going to need a lot of patches and fixes to get it to the standard this game was hyped up to be. the story, voice acting, music and world building are really superb but all the bugs and performance issues are breaking the immersion and overall experience on a almost constant basis, and this is just concerning the main quest story line. as far as the open world goes, visually it looks amazing with ray tracing features enabled but gameplay wise its just another checklist of a map to clear. how you came across side quests almost felt natural in the witcher 3 but in cyberpunk 2077 its all there laid out on the map to clear to just rinse and repeat these combat encounters. which are enjoyable at first but soon start to feel kind of the same. its clear a lot of content for the open world was cut in order to push this game out of the door. my advise wait a couple of months and give the devs a change to finish the game. because i honestly believe this awful launch is attributed to incomprehensible missmanagement. played on i7 8700k rtx 3080 32gb ram  2400mhz"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"game has bugs, but the story and gameplay is so engangeing that it is easy to look past it's flaws. the gameplay is reminiscent of fallout new vegas and elders rolls oblivion, except that for those games i never really cared about the characters and story. all the characters are unique in cyberpunk 2077 and they are super consistent with their behaviour which really makes the game come alive. my only gripe is that since the story branches so much i felt that my particular ending was a little short and could have been more fleshed out and satisfying. i bought this game on google stadia and tried it with both controller and mouse and keyboard. i have to say that mouse and keyboard is definitely the best way to experience this game as you need the precision of a mouse."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"now that the hype is over and reality settled in, what remains is a game that is very mediocre in pretty much all aspects. not entirely bad, but certainly underwhelming and sometimes even boring. cyberpunk 2077 is one of those games that tries to do everything, but gets nothing right. by far it's biggest issue is the discrepancy of features promised by cdpr and features actually implemented in the game. the ubiquitously hyped life path system practically doesn't exist and the often teased aspect of player choice is mostly limited to the last mission. another serious shortcoming is the game's open world design. despite being large and always having something going on, the player can interact with hardly anything present. there is next to no object continuity and believability suffers greatly from a lack of depth. so, somewhat ironically, this vast, busy open world ends up feeling lifeless, artificial and empty. i could go on and on talking about the games shortcomings, because they are plenty. the lackluster combat, rng elements, uninspired story and abysmal technical state are just a few of them. honestly the only commendation would go to keanu reeves, who manages to pull off one of the most nuanced and straight up badass sidekick characters of video game history. anyways, cyberpunk 2077 is definitley not a worthy successor to the monument of good game design that was the witcher 3 and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to triplea titles released in the recent past, such as rdr2. it's fair to say that cdpr likely lost most of it's credibility within its fanbase with this this release, which manages to underdeliver in every regard. in the end the only remaining question is, how the supposed poster child of the video games industry could justify spending nearly 8 years on creating such a mediocre experience."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"please note  the 910 rating is a reflection of my own experience and isn't representative of the game necessarily . . where to begin ? i still didn't finish the game . however i've spent near 40 hours so far and i think it's a decent amount of time to form my opinion on the game . 1game looks gorgeous 2side quests are fun and are my favorite part 3though you may not have total control over every path you take , you do feel immersed with the the dialog options . 4 driving may feel weird at first but it's a lot fun once you get used to it 5 main story and side stories are both engaging and at first you naturally feel confused giving you are new to cyberpunk world but as you move on you start to care about some characters and hate some others . 6 there was this side quest where i had a debate about god with one character , i thought that was interesting . .. few comments i would like to make . i think the buggy lunch have made people rightfully angry , specially on console however i believe some of the criticism of the story and game play isn't accurate . cyberpunk isn't like gta . or red dead . it's meant to be a massive web net of sub stories that are connected to the main story . the marketing may have exaggerated how alive night city is . and they should answer for that . but nevertheless i'v enjoyed walking the city to find couple of cops in need of a helping hand , or meeting few gang members who need to be taught a lesson . or running into a monk who lecture me about how evil this new world is . the world of cyberpunk is beautiful and full of side quests and points of interests . and i believe if you have realistic exceptions you will love the game . this is coming from someone who usually hates first person experience and dislikes high tech stories . i'm more a fun of medieval times kinda games like for honor , man i love that game . but at any case , cyberpunk was an exception and i love it and wish not to finish it anytime soon. . i'm playing on pc and though there were few bugs here and there , it wasn't anything out of the ordinary . about the same amount of bugs you find in any typical open world game . nothing major or game breaking. . and i will end with this  imagine far cry and deus ex got married . cyberpunk would be the child that got the best of both worlds . . have fun playing the game . peace ."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"cyberpunk 2077 does have some bugs, but nothing that would destroy your experience. the campaign is awesome and your choices influence your story in amazing ways! the game is everything they promised and way more ! the characters are so well written and there is also the other prospects, for exemple, the weapons or the driving. i recommend it and if you dont want to experience the bugs i think you should just wait a little."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"game works fine on my, now old, pc. could be better, but it's still nice. i personally didn't encountered major bugs, some glitches here and there, but, again, nothing worth remembering. probably i should consider myself lucky, with this small amount of problems. my subjective experience is rather good, city though simple because of ai is overwhelmingly beautiful and complex in it's structure. level of details is truly great. story so far is very nice, something not about saving the world, which is nice change from other games. but immersive feeling during main quests dialogues and action is really something else. overall it's a great game, fantastic story in beutiful city. if only bugs were less, and ai of citizens smarter it would be a pinnacle game experience."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"come on guys, this is one awesome game. yes there are a few bugs like hanging cigarettes in air, but i personally see at max 12 bugs a day and had only very few crashes in the last week. remember what you get here for 60 compared to 30 spent in a cinema with some coke and unhealthy tacos. 1. you get one of the best cyberpunk genre stories ever. i say that and only played 20 main story after 60 hours gameplay, i really fear to consume the story too fast and instead do a lot of the addictive side quests, each of them is a cool story, not grinding. even if you just help someone who gets beat up by a street gang in the side street. 2. you get a shooter kind of like borderlands mixed with gta. 3. but most of all you get art and atmosphere! you get an awesome soundtrack including a real life band skinned for an ingame band samurai. you get stunning visuals in an extremely large futuristic city, free to explore. and yes you cannot explore every single apartment that has nothing to do with the story or anything... but why would you and what would it add to the game? this is not a life simulation it's a game. 4. again this game is pure art in story, visuals, state of the art effects, paired with awesome localization. hell they even have keanu reeves as ingame character as cool companion. 5. a very deep dystopia, showing the few pros and many cons of unregulated tech advancements and capitalism  just like near future scifi should be. it has some downsides though, like the inventory needs an overhaul for sure. also low level clothingarmor combinations can look trashy sometimes. also there are no item sets, this would add to the game a lot. very bad indeed is the crowd ai, this really needs some variation. when i shoot in a shooting contest, i do not want to have all crowd models duck and scream 100 meters away, this is just plain stupid if hear any shoot fired by player in range, go to duckandcry state for 2 minutes  this is ai nowadays? in my opinion i would not have the game released for ps4 and xbox one at all. why support such old consoles at all? looks like there were some greedy investors yes, but which company does not suffer from them? it's more like if you want any company start such an ambitious project in the future, then support these guys and give them a chance to fix some bugs. most studios are not even alive or independent for 8 years. if we want such huge and artful games like cyberpunk 2077, we must live with studios making financial driven decisions sometimes. otherwise we end up with only the same games over and over like cod 20. i give it 1010 as thank you for the great effort and in trust there will be updates."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-19,"the best rpg for last 34 years. sorry for my english. short summary immediately i was played 100 hrs, completed 5 endings, finished 90 side quest, and still what complete all of them  under side quest i not consider a fixers contracts . yes it's not a revolution in gameplay ,but this game has steps there. and it's still much better than copypaste aaa products of other giants! i should mention , that i was playing on pc, on 19201200 resolution, with gtx 1060. but not on max setting, some shadows settings was levered. my recommendation for pc gamers, set all settings related to cascade shadows on low, this gives you around 2030 of fps . cons  a bunch of non critical bugs, at least in my gameplay. for all my of 100 hrs of my gameplay , i have to load just 45 times because of some bugs. for example my car just killed me when i called it. few times i was killed when i was jumped from small height.  game has bunch of graphics bugs and optimization issues, at least on pc it's non critical.  some rares animation bugs, at leest for me, don't agro on this   car driving isn't the best side of the game. but cars itself is just amazing.  unbalanced craft , but this is a singeplayer , so it's non critical, if you what easy game you always could use cheatengine of artmoney. pros  it has just amazing main story ,which intersect with some of the side character quest lines. i have pass 5 of different endings, all of them are quite impressive and some of them just knock out a tear from me. main story, with related side characters quests lines , is comparable with witcher 3 story by size and favour  game has a bunch of side quest lines that doesn't affects main story, by they are no less interesting. check the peralez family , kerry eurodyne sides and brendan story.  quite interesting gameplay for mele or netranner builds. gun builds doesn't impress me. my recommendation  play on highest difficulty , it's totally changes the impression from battles.  just amazing attention to detail. for example , the news and ads on the television changes sometimes from your actions. when i knock down to death some one on the car in the fist time, there was news about that. some other actions also changes news and ads . when you complete some of the contracts targeted for some gangs , they also changes relation to you on streets, and there is some phrase changes during the battle. and some more similar small changes in the world, related with your actions.  some side dialogs of random peoples on the streets, just fun!  one of the best music sets. yes , there is not to much to do on the car in town. but sometimes i'm just travel on the car , just to listen some of the tracks.  town, i'm just love the cyberpunk town architecture  a lot of easter eggs, and some of them with really nice stories that you could find on the chips in same locations.  localization, at least for russian language, just amazing  10  10.  lip sync is related with selected language  the best animation technical feature in this game!  character animation technique. yes it's buggy, but from tech side it's just better than any other games. yep, i'm just a fan of the cyberpunk genre. if you want full impression , just read this one  william ford gibson  sprawl trilogy neuromancer 1984 count zero 1986 mona lisa overdrive 1988 after this books, you definitely will have the totally different vision on main story."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"don't listen to the overhyped disappointed kids. cyberpunk seems to be a decent game, which suffers from a rushed bad launch. possibly a data crunch coders revenge on the company management. putting it simply i'll never again preorder any game, as it encourages developers to deliver an unfinished, unpolished, untested product too early. i did that with warhammer age of reckoning online and i did that with bf4, just as i did that with sponge bob square pants and cyberpunk. you know what... the only one that wasn't a disappointment was the sponge bob. i play on an older powerhorse i7965x pc so there is a multitude of errors in cyberpunk 2077. which weighs on the overall experience, but most of these said errors and glitches don't seem to be gamebreaking more like immersionbreaking hiccups that could and probably will be resolved by cdproject in the foreseeable future. thou i must admit the the avx compatibility is a big oversight on their part, as there seem to be still a lot of people with older powerhorse cpus who didn't upgrade to new machines simply because their good old powerhorses are still running 99 of games flawlessly. this is the 2nd time i encountered the avx issue with a game and the other game was children of orc on steam. i . so the first one i encountered was the avx crash after tutorial in a bar, as soon as i left the pub game would crash on me in exactly the same spot. so far to my understanding, this hasn't been resolved by cpr and i managed to bypass it by running the game with a user modified exe file available on modnexus it bypasses the avx error. it does so i assume by disabling its calling functions completely in the game file. to my understanding, the avx functions are responsible for things like where the objects and npc are, and when in the game. ii. disabling avx could explain later behaviourglitching that constantly repeats ingame afterwards. lots of objects seem misplaced, three or more npcs spawning at the same time in the same place and making a t pose, cups, burgers, cigarettes hanging in space at the same time another cigarette is being smoked by an npc they are assigned to who is nearby, or at that spot. iii. objects that seem to be collectablepickup enabled, yet i am unable to pick them up, often ones that are laying on or near other objects, like some drugs on a bin, or a card by the doors in your apartment. seems like the larger object would be covering them somehow wits it mesh or something so that they can't be interacted with. but this could have to do with avx as well. iv. some objects seem to have their textures missing or there is something wrong with their geometry, but more like missing or incorrect textures. one way or another they are displayed as something completely out of place. v. ragdolls and bodies behave strangely after they die, some you can mutilate further some you don't. some are rock solid some flop about, most of the posses are a bit off and hanging over the ground. vi. all character facial on body animations for random people conversations seem to be missing. vii. you can't just mug people, how do you want me to be a cyberpunk if i can't mug people right in the middle of the street for fun. viii. random npcs hit absolute panic mode not just after you shoot or blow up a grenade nearby but as well as soon as you bump into them with your character especially while running. they hit survival mode, scream a lot, make the rest people around them panic and don't seem to leave that mode until you leave the area, and come back later. overall it feels immersion breaking, would be much better if they would return to normal activities after a while if the danger is over. viii. didn't notice any changes in weather effects so far so that's meh. ix. smoke has no physics. x. mirrors do not reflect the character and the world reflected is very blurry. beside the shabby apparent window. xi. you can't play in the third person camera, besides while driving the car. xii. difficulty and enemy npc behaviour after being attackedhacked is rather limited, their spotting range is quite short as well. this makes the whole experience rather easy. xiii. some items and objects have their description messed up and it's showing the literal text path from the file and then the text of the description, or some similar blunder. xiv. geometry elements like wires etc. sometimes are incorrectly sized or attached to building so it looks like they're socketed into a thin air etc. mostly encountered on rooftops. xv. there is no wall running and the parkour elements are a bit stiff. as well rooftop areas are rather empty. xvi. most cars drives ok but the collisions are a joke, in both terms, the damagedestruction and the heavinessweight feeling, cars feel like they're made of cardboard because of this. they lack velocity if i'm correct. xv. environmental destruction is not what they promised. 610 for now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game is a very demanding game with its large map and intricate lighting. the story is absolutely crazy and is so inticing and something that will probably never see in a very long time, now the story is amazing but however, i believe they spent too much time on the story rather than the actual gameplay. the gunplay is awkward, the reload animations seem clumsy and the recoil is questionable, glitches are of course expected as the game just released but they did spend 7 years making this game and they could've fixed the bugs that absolutely ruin the intensive cutscenes."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"having lived the hype for this game for several months and recently sunk my teeth into it for 40 hours i can say i enjoyed playing this game. however, i am left with little of the satisfaction i had compared to similarly hyped singleplayer aaa games. whilst much news has been made of the bugs experienced on consoles, playing on a midrange pc i experienced few major ones and nothing i'm not prepared to forgive if i could love the elder scrolls despite it's bugs this is nothing. the real issue is the lack of meaningful choices many missions offer you choices in how to complete them but very few actually result in meaningfully different outcomes. their are no factions you can join, so no gangs or corps that you can choose to work with treat you differently after their missions are complete. there are several interesting side quests but these again don't impact much of the wider world once completed. in comparison to say fallout new vegas, your skills and attributes rarely offer consequential dialogue options only yellow dialogue options progress the story. as for romance there are several short lived romance cutscenes, but as a straight man which i'll wager is the majority of players i was given only one choice for an actual romance and i would argue one option is not a choice. lastly, without spoilers, none of the main mission endings allows you to continue playing in the open world, which really disappointed me. as an open world this game pales in comparison to the likes of bethesda's elder scrolls or fallout. as a linear story this game doesn't carry the weight of say bioware's mass effect or dragon age or even kotor before them. simply put, older games have achieved more with older technology and for such a grand game 8 years in the making cyberpunk 2077 will fall well short of most gamers' expectations in the long run! the only thing that can save this game are many patches and many expansive story dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"just finished the game for the first time and i fell... not sure how to put that in words. hope there is some major post story dlc like the blood and wine expansion for witcher 3, the game has some nice looking endings but hopefully, they flesh it out with a bunch of stability updates and a big dlc or 2."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"best game of the past 10 years, forsure. the story is immersive, impressive and outright genius. the graphics are amazing to those of you running it on 7 year old hardwarewhat did you expect? and im not even running it on pc, i'm running cyberpunk 2077 on stadia. i've encountered minor bugs which will get patched eventually so it's not a big deal and most definitely not a dealbreaker. the gameplay is intuitive and the freedom this game gives you to choose your own personality and storyline is something i havent experienced in a long time. fantastic game, and rpgs are not my cup of tea at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. an unfinished masterpiece, but one none the less. overview cyberpunk is the bestlooking and most emotionally impactful game in history at time of release. unfortunately, a myriad of bugs, missing features, and clearly rushed mechanics prevent it from being what it could have been a top five game ever. gameplay cyberpunk plays like the standard open world shooter rpg in the vein of borderlands. its smooth, chaotic, and fun, offering interesting gunplay and hacking option. while the combat is solid and fun it offers nothing new and exciting, simply feeling like a better borderlands. melee combat in particular feels like it could have been greatly improved. driving is very enjoyable, but suffers from glitches and spotty handling. a little tightening up here would have done wonders. the driving ai is nonexistent and it really shows in things like racing. but, open world traversal on a motorcycle is undeniably way more fun than it should be. gamplay outside of combat will feel very familiar as it plays much like the witcher. you talk to people, go place, kill people, and do some light investigating. the real beauty of the game is the sheer wealth of dialogue options that completely shape the course of outcome. cyberpunk takes this further than any other open world game has. story and missions cyberpunk's story is the place it really shines. the main questline is exhilarating, wellpaced, and seamlessly intertwined with engaging side missions. it tugs on emotions, and the voice acting is superb mostly. cyberpunk easily stands up next to the better storydriven games in history such as the last of us, bioshock infinite, heavy rain, and mass effect. this is where the game excels. the main quest and a solid nucleus of about half a dozen critical side missions provide the core to the game, each with engaging characters and branching paths that affect not only the quest itself but the end game. the only negative here is that while there are a huge amount of gig style quests think fetch quests and other generic things and a decent number of core side quests with considerable impact to the story, there isn't much in between. you can tell just by looking at a quest if its important or not, and it doesn't feel organic. most quests are initiated by phone calls, rather than discovering them naturally. there was barely a handful of quests that began and played out naturally while exploring, and almost all of these occurred in the first act of the game. graphics obviously, this depends on your hardware. i'm running two generation old specs 1080ti and it runs flawlessly. on medium settings at 1440p the world looks amazing, making it easily on the most beautiful games. charecter models look natural, especially in key scenes. and this is without high end graphic features like ray tracing. glitches and bugs on pc these are greatly exaggerated. i have experienced a myriad of minor bugs items clipping, weird physics, voice overs not playing but the quest progressing, etc, but only two bugs caused me to reload a save or restart the game, and both of those occurred day or release. cd projectred's history suggests that these glitches will be addressed completely within weeks at most. other notes much of the reasons for disappointment is what cyberpunk didn't do. it didn't push the envelope on a vibrant world that felt alive. it didn't blow my mind with custom features. it didn't redefine open world games. what it did, it did well, but it left opportunities. for example, simple things like the ability to change your hair or tattoos don't exist. rating and rationale despite the myriad of letdowns in this game, when you look past the hype, it is a genredefining though not revolutionary openworld game. with a topnotch story, beautiful world, and vibrant character that form emotional connections, this game pulls all the right levers. my gut rating would be an 8.510. but when comparing this to other openworld games such as the borderlands series, red dead redemption, gta, and fallout, cyberpunk has a slight edge over all of them even in its unfinished state. it has more heart, more replayability, and a much better story. for this reason, i give cyberpunk 2077 a 910 at launch with the opportunity to improve if issues like poor driving ai and lack of appearance editing options are added in future patches and dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"there are issues with this game far past the wealth of bugs you encounter. some of my biggest gripes stem from the npc ai and the lack of content in night city. driving feels lifeless, there are zero car customization options, and npcs drive scripted, unimpacted by things like assault with a deadly weapon or your vehicle blocking their path. i was somebody who was extremely excited to play this game. i could not have been more let down by the rpg and combat elements. barebones gear and weapons, an extremely average perk system are culminate in an extremely disappointing role playing experience. i could completely look past the bugs but the fact is this game is extremely low quality in this current state. points for graphics and an above average main story line."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"twice i turned on the pc to refund the game. ended up playing for hours instead. yes it is buggy af. yes it have way too many missing features from what they promise. yes the ai is just  and lifeless, almost nonexistent. but good lord is it a fun ass game. the story is just top notch. the characters are designed with so much care. even all the side missions that are fun as hell. once the game is polished out, and maybe is they fix the police ai, i highly recommend that you try this game. with a huge discounted price."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,im playing on rtx 2070 super rayzen 3900x .. time flys so fast when i play cyberpunk. the fun im having with this game allowed me to forgive the occasional frame drops here and there i believe that will be fixed. what cant be fixed is how shallow the story is! maybe some dlcs can give the story some depth.. will update my review as soon as i finish the full game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i don't usually rate games a 10 and it really doesn't deserve it because of the bugs and all, buttttt i have been really enjoying it on stadia and i think they are overencumbered with hate so i wanted to boost the team at cdpr for their fantastic work. if you need a scape goat blame the investors for rushing th release. the game is smooth and solid on stadia, the story is captivating, the world is lush and full of life and the bugs are aplenty but overall its a fun and exhilarating experience and cdpr has done an outstanding job story telling. the people crying over the bugs are the same people that were crying and shaming them for not releasing creating the additional pressure. games of today are not supermario, there is much more complexity involved. real score is an 8.5. i can't give them a 10 but here is the breakdown story  10 immersion  9.5 plentifulness of world  10 gear and customization  10 rpg elements  10 driving and cars  7.5 a little disappointed there technology  6.5 lots of little immersion breaking bugs, some interrupting bugs even requiring forcing restarts. responsiveness of cdpr  10, they have already released a couple of updates soo i am sure it will eventually get the love it deserves. audio  10 its amazing and fitting for the environment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"surey the game has technical flaws, and its not as massive and groundbreaking as we all expected it to be. still, i found it very addictive, the main story is great and sidequests, while kinda repetitive, are fun to play given the amout of ways you can play. it is a great immersive sim, deserving to stand alongside deus ex, systemshock and vampires the masquared  bloodlines. and the setting is great, especially if you are a fan of cyberpunk books like neuromancer."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,great game  great story immersive world ok graphics  some very minor bugs and i am playing on a 5 year old computer. i understand some people playing on below average computers are upset but my landline telephone is also not that useful these days
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"well, what can i said, one of the best games i played. even bugs cant ruing my experience. spend about 120 hours for the first run with 100 completion. ready to dive back in again. if a cyberpunk setting is not your thing, i wouldn't recommend even try it since all storylines based on questions related to it. this game is not gta in a cyberpunk setting, so don't expect an open world and sandboxlike gta. all in all, if you a fan of the cyberpunk setting, good story, interesting character, and wellmade side quests, welcome aboard. have a pleasant ride along with jhony silverhand."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i really don't see what everyone is complaining about with bugs being unbearable. i've had a few people get stuck in cars and walls, that's about it. the game itself is immersive and brilliant, absolutely stunning. this is a revolutionary and defining moment in video games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"in short it runs decent on my pc but the open world is lifeless and unappealing. run from side mission to side mission, kill a bunch of brainless goons and loot some unremarkable loot that all looks the same. sooo much content is missing it will take years to bring up to pace with current open world games kind of a shame steam isn't offering refunds. i really feel bad for anyone who worked on this game and gave it their all it will always be a black stain on their resume."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"sound 110, if you don't have certain hardware the game sounds actually don't show up. gameplay 410, its basically shoot and slash, bad version of border lands. story 110 linear, choices don't matter. characters 110 all forgettable since the game is like 10 hours long. side quests 110 all have the exact same solution. storm in and shoot even at the max difficulty. other issues depending of hardware the game basically is trash. unless you have a 3,000 pc don't even bother. it really seems that the community is trying to bump up this game,since the positive is like...1010 crashed a few times, had to save scrub a few times due to bugs, but really enjoyed beta testing this grabage dump. ps decided to play witcher 3 since i had never played it. the starting area seems to have more development than all of cyber punk 2077."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"so... wanted to write some special review for this game as i've been waiting for this game longest i've ever been waiting for a game. decided not too because i'm lazy. in huge shortcut game met my sky high expectations, at least when it comes to story telling and quality of quests, exploration, immersion. graphics are stunning and i don't understand people saying gta v looked better i'm playing on medium so idk, maybe ultra looks worse that this p game would be 1010 if not crashes everytime i'm in more densly crowded area, especially in jigjig street and japan town."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,cyberpunk 2077 is at most a great linear story game. the lack of actual rpg elements in a game advertised as an rpg until 2019 after most preorders were put in place is utterly astounding. the openworld is devoid of life and many storyline characters are thrown away after one or two uses. not only that but to release that game in this state is a brave move in itself. there is not 10 minutes i didn't run into some immersionbreaking bug. it is obvious that most of their budget went into marketing rather than playtesting. i suppose that is the era we live in today? releasing broken games and promising to fix them afterward. save yourself the money and buy an actual rpg from a decent developer.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,just terrible and bugridden. cdpr reveals itself to be just another aaa game publisher that abuses its employees and wants nothing more than to drain the wallets of consumers while delivering boring and broken games.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"an amazing game, an amazing atmosphere, but of course there are technical problems, i think in the future they will fix everything. thanks cdpr!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game is enjoyable, good looking, well written. the side quests are pretty nice too and feel good to complete. there are quite a few bugs but the gamebreaking ones are very rare. bugs are the only reason i give it a 9 overall. everything else is worth a 10. would replay. on a side note, i understand playstation 4 players are angry but the ones who wrote the reviews mentioning delays that should be enough are the same who wrote angry tweets complaining about those same delays. this is the reason why they couldn't delay it more. i also saw a review mentioning life choices and saying it didn't affect your game. i'm going to correct it it does affect your game. during the whole game, you are often presented with dialogue options that can only be done depending on your path. seeing how that user also mentioned several other matters that do not match the game even right on the day 0 patch, i wouldn't trust that review."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i played this game on a not very strong pc. i3 101001650s but even on medium settings, i experienced a great gaming experience. i'm not a fan of super graphics at all. my favorite games so far are nwn, arcanum, tyrrany, etc. cyberpunk is among them. after 40 hours of playing, i'm fascinated by the narrative, story, and content of the game. yes, sometimes there are some bugs, but i believe cdpr, i believe that they will bring the game to shine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"at this moment, no matter that this is pc or lastnext gen consoles, game is really bad. there is nothing from briliance of witcher 3. game looks like halfbaked and fixes will change nothing. and yeah, i mean also those rpg called elements. this is also dramatical. story like from weak book  shallow and simple. decisions make no difference at all  another  from cdpr about that. characters are so simple and unimportant that i don't know why u even bother to make notes about them in the diary. this is just very bad game. and yeah, i played on very nice pc. and yeah, i was fan of witcher 3. but this, few steps backwards in game dev. technicaly is even worse. complete disaster. one bar for music. and that is max what game deserves."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i enjoyed the game, but it shouldn't have been released like that. i understand that some people wanted to play it fast, but it wasn't worth it. now that i see the negativity from sony and their fans, i realize that we live in a world of big corporations. that's what this game is about. it opened our eyes to reality. it's tried to be crushed because it contains the truth about what's going on in the world. it's a deep, philosophical, honest game with incredible detail. there's nothing like it today. to me, it's the benchmark game. bugs are everywhere, and here they're even fun."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game is incredible and the level of immersion in night city is somewhat surreal, the characters are extremely captivating and the story manages to trap and surprise you on a great level. the beginning, middle and end of the main story is very good, the side quests are as good as some other games on the market, the outcome of each character is very well constructed and the way that these characters affect at the end of the story is wonderful. i cannot ignore the problems, because there were many and they also affected me, but i decided to just ignore and follow the story, for me and only me, i think it was worth every minute played. ps with absolute certainty this game needed another 6 months to be released."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the best game i've ever played. although ai is not great and there are some bugs not as many as people say, the rest is executed perfectly. a masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i'm going to ignore bugs for this review, because while i had some i didn't have anything game breaking. this game could run absolutely perfect and would still be a disappointing experience. this does not feel like a aaa game, it looks like one, but does not behave like one. i am not exaggerating when i say gta 3 on the ps2 has better systems and design than this game. let's start with vehicles. handling is generally bad for the player. vehicles either have extremely stiff steering to the point you will leave skid marks trying to make a turn going 20 mphand still not be able to make the turn, or they are so floaty that barely turning the wheel will turn you completely sideways. any ai controlled vehicle that is scripted to go somewhere is a complete tank. it will continue to it's path ignoring traffic and signals. any vehicle in this scripted vehicle's way will literally just be thrown in the air out of the way. normal ai will also run you over with no issue and keep driving. but on the flip side there is almost no place to park in this game. so, you park on the sidewalk but often if even a small part of your vehicle is on the road it will cause a huge traffic jam. there are also many areas the game just won't let you drive. so, if you thought you could ride your motorcycle through a short cut you will find yourself just being stuck. it will often just force you to get off your bike or car. ai in general is awful. normal civilians cower in fear at everything. they don't even try to run usually. you can come out from doing a mission in a building to see tons of npc civilians all over the place just hunkered down in fear. in combat enemies often do nothing. if you play a run and gun style it is stupid easy. you can literally run up to npcs that are in cover and stand right next to them and they will just stare at the wall. if you commit a crime police just constantly spawn right next to you regardless of were you are. it's surprising there is any crime in night city at all. the main story is very short and most of it is padded with dialog. when it comes to actually playing the game you won't do much of that here. there aren't a ton a side quests and many of them don't involve anything but dialog. most of actual gameplay comes from doing gigs and going to active crime scenes. active crime scenes are boring often just 3 to 5 enemies out in the open to kill. some gigs are interesting some not. all of them are very short. and once you complete these things there is nothing to do in this game at all. they could have at least made radiant gigs with scaling enemies in the many buildings in the game to provide something to do but they didn't. once you finish this stuff, this game is over. you could start a new character and try a different play style, but you will have to suffer through a lot of unskippable boring parts of the story. who your character is means little in this world. advertised as the way you look will make an impact but it doesn't. there are many times the game stripped me naked and i forgot to put clothes back on. nobody said a word about this, it didn't matter what i looked like or dressed like. and customization is lacking. if you thought you could get cool robotic visual parts like the npcs have you'll be disappointed. your lifestyle choice is also a joke. all this does is change the first 10 minutes of the game. you get a couple different dialog choices here and there that don't impact anything. you also get a small side quest but that's it. no matter your background you will end up living at the same place, driving the same car, knowing the same people, and advancing through the plot down the same path. the few decisions you make through out you may not even realize have effects on things. this is actually interesting world building. the problem is they are far and few. and the differences are so small that it's not worth playing through again to see what something else would have done. and many choices lead no where. overall this game is a wreck. that being said i was still able to enjoy it. it has a ton a potential but many parts of the game at this point seem like a concept build. if they can fix ai, fix scripting, add more things to do, add some radiant gigs, a lot more quests, add better and more customization it would be so much more acceptable. some things are too late to change like more weight to decisions, and having your life path choice be more interesting. so, even with the fixes and sorting out bugs this game will never be great it can still be good though. i pray for an overhaul and dlc that will make it worth starting a new game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"love the gameplay, especially how levelling up works. the story is good. optimization kinda , yet the game doesn't have as much bugs as people cry. world works like look don't touch but it won't be an issue if you have some imagination. imo most of the people on pc just hate the game without any thinking, hate hype train works."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the negatives the game is full of bugs ranging from minor visual issues to occasional game breaking bugs requiring restarts, the ai is pretty poor with traffic feeling straight out of a ps2 open world game, npcs randomly ducking for cover  not particularly reacting to your actions. the police system is a straight up joke with them spawning in from dead ends  solid walls, at one point in the main building they came from my own apartment.. a bigger issue is that they are no real threat, to escape them all you have to do is run quickly in a straight line before they quickly give up this feels like it could have been done so much better with things like police arriving on jetpacks it suffers greatly when comparing areas like drivingpedestrian  civilian interactions  police chases   ai to other open world games. the positives, the story is decent though it feels like the option trees aren't quite as wide or impactful as you would hope in an rpg, the 3 classes choice barely seems to impact the game at all other than a few throwaway dialogue lines. whilst the game is no cod, the combat blows other open world games out of the water being quite fun and fluid. the stealth system is about as generic as you'd expect however, the quick hack ability comes off as more  than an actual legitimate way to play  far more efficient to go in guns blazing rather than the constant stealth restarts or messing with quick hacks. if you have the hardware to run it, the game is beautiful the world is dense and 3 dimensional successfully pulling off an element of verticality that i've not seen in other open world games before. the map becomes even better as you level up your character and obtain cybernetic unlocks allowing greater movement such as double jumps. when all is said and done, i'm 40 hours in and itching to get back on and play more. hopefully cdpr improve with patches  dlc down the line, i'd love to see what more they could do to expand and improve this amazing world they have created"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"graphics are great, mostly thanks to nvidia raytracing though. story is mediocore, with keanu reeves being the only good part of it. and by that i mean his acting, not his poorly written character. most gameplay features like driving and shooting aren't great. no scrap that, driving freaking . the only way the devs apparently know how to up the difficulty is by changing two sliders on enemies, health and damage. which to be fair does make the harder and also a total bullet sponge simulator. aside from the fact that game is a buggy mess, i was able get through the game relativly sane. the story choicesdialogue options are a joke, they're horrible. this game is a 2010 game wrapped with nice 2020 graphics and raytracing thanks nvidia for that, not you cdpr. the game is unfinished and overall not that great. not recommened at all, buy the witcher 3 instead."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,the amount of content that was removed in order to roll out a bugfilled rushed product like this is incredible. the disingenuous developer doesnt help the case. do not buy.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"remember the trailer about life choices and how it will affect your entire game? guess what, it only changes the first 15 minutes of the game. remember the trailer about the most vibrant, immersive world like never seen before? guess what, there isn't even traffic ai, npc's on the street don't know what to do, there is not a single thing to interact with in the city. there are not car chases because there is no driving ai. the cops spawn behind you, because they don't know how to drive and can't actually arrive at the scene. cars keep popping in and out as you rotate your head. remember how night city was supposed to be smaller, but because of it's verticality the possibilities would be huge? guess what, there are a handful of towers which have 2 to 3 floors. remember that trailer about style, how there are 4 different clothing styles and how these will affect your game, who you are? your cyberware, your tattoos, the guns? guess what. there is 0 customization and you can't even get a haircut, tattoo or see the affect of cyber mods on your character. remember that trailer about the cars, their style, their purpose? guess what. none of it really matters because the driving is absolutely insane, cars are completely random and meaningless why is night city full of trucks without trailers?. i can keep going on like that, but none of the promises are real and it's overall a terrible game. advertised as the most immersive world to date, it lacks basic npc ai which games like gta3 and mafia had these games are almost 20 years old. litteraly every open world game in the last 20 years has had traffic ai, npc's reacting to the player, random things to interact with.. but cyberpunk doesn't have any of that. as long as you follow the main story and ignore the stupid ai, the game is ok. but get off the main quest and you begin to realize what a disaster this game is."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i just beat cyberpunk after 6080 hours of gameplay. i did all of the side quests and gigs, and most of the police scanner events until i eventually got bored and decided to wrap it up. i absolutely loved this game from start to finish. admittedly i do have a higher end rig, and i personally experienced very few performance issues outside of maybe 23 crashes throughout my entire playthrough. i firmly believe that cdpr is a victim of their own marketing teams success, and they may need to tone down their verbiage when detailing their games in the future. you simply can't make statements such as cyberpunk is the most immersive open world game, and then not follow through. cyberpunk does not reinvent the wheel with most of its content, but its a very solid open world rpg non the less. that being said, i really don't understand the need for a lot of the immersive features that other people are complaining about. i have seen posts comparing cyberpunk's npc daily routines to the daily routines that npc's have in rdr2. who cares? these types of features are nice to have, but they do not make a game fun. not for me atleast. there is absolutely room for improvement. i don't think anyone can deny that cdpr didn't see their vision fulfilled. i would love to see combat ai improvements, more enemy variety in general, and a working police system. there is also room to be disappointed, but we're also seeing a lot of reviews being made in bad faith. hating on cyberpunk is the new cool thing to do on the internet looking at your reddit. the user review for acv is currently higher than cyberpunk, and that should tell you everything that you need to know about these types of polarized reviews. in no way is this game worse than the run of the mil assassin creed games ubisoft puts out every year. i own both games, and cyberpunk is superior on every front... other than perhaps running on a 7 year old console. i've had way more bugs in almost every other open world rpg than i have in cyberpunk. i hope cdpr makes more cyberpunk games, and we end up looking back on cyberpunk 1 like we now do with witcher 1. cyberpunk absolutely did not tarnish my view of cdpr, and i will continue to look forward to their games in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i have waited 8 years for this game, and i am satisfied with every second i play in it. i believe that if you love games as art and do not want gamedev to turn into a conveyor belt, then you need to raise the rating of the game, since it does not deserve all this hate. make game great again!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"truth be told, this just isn't a very good game, performance and bugs aside. story and characters are somewhere between mediocre and good, combat is mediocre, stealth is mediocre, driving is mediocre. the setting and the lore is where this game shines and visually stunning, but the city feels dead with nothing to do and lifeless ai. what really kills this game is the lack of choice and consequence along with the shockingly barebones customization. the world doesn't react to anything you do. in a vacuum, this game is mediocre. considering the marketing and the false promises, this game is a disaster. would not recommend unless either serious fixes and free dlc are delivered or you are looking for an okay story while driving around shooting stuff."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"in the year on which the original roleplaying game was based, cyberpunk finally burst the hype bubble. and not in the best way. cd projekt red offers us an eyecatching game, with a rich and detailed recreation of night city, surpassing the expectations established in its first ingame trailer two years ago and raising a new graphic standard. the design of all the missions is varied and shows the special dedication of its developers in making them all different and even sometimes emotional andor exciting, whether they are the several available from the main plot or one of its many subplots. but for its development it seems that too many resources have been dedicated to the console versions that do not propose anything technically acceptable and that should have been canceled since they saw that they were not viable, causing a taste of unfinished soak all other sections of the game. the city lacks interactivity, even the most basic ones hundreds of stores with which not to interact even though the game proposes a really overwhelming variety of items, streets full of people with whom not to share any interaction and even with behaviors as basic as erratic, bugs at all levels, sometimes serious collision failures that cause instantaneous deaths, map exits, low poly graphics, objects melted on the ground or flying and a long etc.. , many buildings with a lot of verticality ... but the vast majority unused and pure decoration ... cyberpunk 2079 was an ambitious project and really cd projekt red had the potential and knowhow to bring it to a successful conclusion. unfortunately, we see that at the executive level big strategic mistakes have led to the drift of what could have been the game of the decade. the potential is there and i have no doubt that this will end up being a tremendous game but it condemns its developers to spend more time on it than should have been necessary, and it condemns players to endure disappointment in the hope of one day seeing what this roleplaying game really should have been from the beginning."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this game shouldn't have been released for at least another year, unoptimized junk, such a disappointment."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i really enjoy this game. night city is amazing, the main and sub quest are engaging with great voice acting and npc that really come to life when in a conversation. you can create different kinds of builds, like pure melee or a hacking ninja. enough flexibility for multiple playthroughs. too bad the expectations of this game were way to high and unrealistic. cdpr is to blame for this, but the hype train also. the bugs i encountered were thankfully not game breaking, but they certainly have a lot of fixing to do. personally i have a blast here in nc!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this is actually very good game. it isnt all i hoped for but it is great as it is. i must say that i havent seen much of bugs and glitches that everybody talks so much. it may be that my pc actually just gets along with this game better then others but i really had great time with it. as i said this game didnt gave me all i hoped for but story is good and and mechanics work, if not like i hoped it will then very close to it. world is not so open and detailed as promised, but usually that is the case with most games of this kind. witcher 3 it sure isnt. there are some things i hoped would be better but then again they are much better then i feared they will end up being after so much delays, rushed up work and crunching everybody talked about. it would probably take some time to clear most  and if we are lucky all of the bugs but this game deserves to be played and enjoyed."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"short and to the point this game is unfinished, the majority of quest while intriguing often end up being nothing more than fetch quest! i feel like nothing i do matters in the game world, there's no reaction to my actions. melee combat feels floaty and without the feeling of impact, sounds are often not there at all during cutscenes, making them feel awkward and empty, bringing the immersion to a halt countless times. driving is awfully average, specifically while writing motorcycles. it's hard to believe this game was created by the same developers that gave us the witcher 3. and it makes me wonder... what did they do for 8 years, since the game was announced? yes there is a compelling and huge potential with what the world could be. but the majority of the time playing this game i found myself wondering where is the cyberpunk 2077 that we were promised?."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,great game despite the bugs but it is going to be fixed. the mechanics are good and the story is astonishing and refreshing with big twists! would recommend when the game is optimized.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this is probably the best game i have ever played. i love it so much! however i have weigh in on this sadly catastrophic launch i've been in the web development business for over 20 years. anyone knows whatever the development time is, you add another extra 33 on top of that for qa testing  bugfixing. cdpr will learn the hard way. i personally haven't experienced that many bugs i only played 56 hours, but the ones i have experienced are a little ridiculously unforgivable npc characters standing inside each other, or inside the floor, or appearing above cars... or spotting me through the walls?! how. weak. dude. cdpr you guys tried to cut down on the costs apparently, and you skimped on qa... get your act together. we all know you can. wtf, seriously. thy aren't even so difficult to find, these bugs you need to setup a line of reference machines. i guess your machines all worked? either that, or you were aware of the bugs. no matter what the case is, cdpr  up. and i'm surprised they did."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,the best game i have ever played. i love the music and plot as well and this how these two aspects create emotions in this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"9.5 it fails the full and perfect 10 noticeably but i think cdpr did what they could. every bit of dialog is magic though, 1010 for dialog. there are a selection of immersive components missing like fueling cars or a mini game to fix vehicles but insofar as a survival mode, there is room to add that. . the soundtrack is also amazing. there is depth and presentation here that i have rarely witnessed and i think this game will make developers rethink how deep their games go."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"first of all i must say that i didn't want from this game to be another gtav, to bring revolution into video games and other miracles. i just wanted the deep story that will surprise me and move me. i wanted a good writing that doesn't feel like written by someone who never read a book in a whole live. i wanted threedimensional characters who can't be described in just one or two sentences. i got all of it plus amazing graphic, stunning city and surprisingly fun gameplay. the story could be a little longer like in witcher 3 and your choices could be more meaningfull but it's still one of the best stories i ever experienced. i am putting this game on one shelf with whole witcher trilogy, rdr2 and hellblade as one of the best written, most mature games ever. p.s. show me other games that randomly quotes aristotles and marcus aurelies..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"it certainly looks really good, if you can run it. otimization will get there but even if most of the bugs are fixed and the performance will get better i can hardly give this more than 610. its a mediocre game, which isnt bad thing but i would have loved this to be so much better. i try not to talk about bugs and performance, i think enough people are doing this already. there is just nothing really standing out whatsoever. i finished the game and cant remember a single breathtaking moment. i tried to like it so much more, but even after 40 hours, seeing a lot, doing a bunch of sidequests, its just this bland mix of things you already encountered in other games  often executed better than in cp2077. the city and spaces are vast but there is so little interaction with it. ill never understand how a bigger map than other games or a previous game is something to look forward to. make it half the size and focus on something else  as a player you still wont ever see everything  even after 100 hours of playing. most of the skillsystem is useless. im not saying that its boring because i personally dont like it. im sure there are people who like to play a certain style so there is a lot to choose from but... getting stronger doesnt feel rewarding at all. levelcap on items makes doing harder quests for the thrill completely obsolete and not fun at all. on the hardest difficulty hits just randomly oneshot you more often and people have more hp  thats hardly nice balancing. no quests that give you the feeling of being in danger. no high risk high reward scenarios. the loot and even the process of looting felt horrible. you only go for color indicators, nothing to really look forward to. the inventory takes you completely out of the game  too slow, too clunky, no clear overview of anything  selling is an extremely painful since it lets you sell the things you have equipped and always asks if you really want to sell a legendary item or something you got equipped, also its very slow. ill leave it at that, i could go on and on and on. it feels like cdpr fell victim to the same thing every company thats too big, or that got too big quickly becomes a victim to the wrong people are in charge, the wrong people make important decisions  not only bad decisions but also just moneydriven decisions  its not a project of heart anymore, im certain its not the lack talent of some people but it feels like the get shut down by the moneymen. its just another title to fill the wallet. too bad it has to be like this, i guess there is no way around it. even blizzard and bethsda got caught  but only after a long reign of wonderful sunshine. i dont think dlc's can fix cyberpunk  maybe im just saying this out of desperation but i honestly think there are just too many things that are not good enough in this game. i appreciate the effort, it was a brave try, sadly to no success in my opinion  not even close."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"summary cyberpunk 2077 is a game with great stories and characters and interesting build options hampered by an uninteractive open world sandbox, bad ai, and a lot of bugs. the good  the main characters are interesting, well written, and well voiced.  the main quest and narrative side content is every bit as engaging as the witcher 3.  the environmental design is just incredible. i have never been in a city in a game that felt so much like a city. the different districts all have their own unique flair, and with creative parkour skills you can reach some amazing vistas. the interiors of most of the buildings are inaccessible though which is a bit of a let down but understandable due to the scale of the city.  the sound design overall as well as the music is very good and adds to the games overall aesthetic.  the visualsgraphics are amazing on even medium grade hardware and truly stunning when you start turning settings up.  the game mechanics and build options are good. gunplay is good for a rpg with a solid cover system. the quickhack system acts as a magic system and is fun to use. melee combat is mostly standard fair for similar type games with light and heavy attacks, blocking, and timed counters. likewise stealth is typical for similar type games. the meh  the side quests are well written but linear. don't expect optional objectives or alternate resolution paths.  driving is okay but needs work. the minimap is too zoomed in when driving which causes you to miss turns or spin out from braking too hard. also in general the cars have too much oversteer. i honestly found myself walking most of the time unless i needed to travel a few kilometers or more. the bad  the open world sandbox is fairly empty. there are side jobs and ncpd assaults which are kind of the replacements for monster contracts and monster nests from the witcher 3, but cdpr hasn't improved emergent gameplay relative to the witcher 3. the only events not driven by the player are ncpd scanner hustles which are small skirmishes between cops and the gangs andor gangs holding a few civilians hostage. i really wish they had added more variety to random events perhaps opportunities to recover stolen goodsvehicles, rob shipments, etc..  speaking of side activities, there are almost no fluff interactive activities. while the game world is absolutely littered with references to braindances you can only access a couple during story missions. besides looting random containers and buying fooddrinks from vending machines basically nothing in the world is interactable.  the npc ai is terrible. traffic moves unnaturally around corners and cars just stop as soon as they encounter an obstacle or slightly deviate off the road. when civilians panic, they just freeze and cower.  the crime system is a complete joke. there is no item ownership at all. if you see it, you can take it consequence free. if you do manage to anger the cops though, about 10 of them randomly spawn out of thin air and start shooting you. luckily, all you have to do to get away is rundrive a block away, and they will completely forget your transgression.  the lootgear system is the same terrible one from the witcher 3. all weapons are leveled which means that your epic quality gun is gunning to be outclassed in a level or two by random world drops unless you spend very difficult to acquire materials to upgrade it. speaking of random world drops, looting is very frustrating with weapons dropping underneath enemies bodies and rooms being littered with spread out loot rather than having a centralized chest with all the good stuff. the game could really use an auto loot system i.e. just run near loot to pick it up rather than having to individually scrounge every item.  last but certainly not least, right now the game is a bit of a buggy mess. i find myself having to reload a save to resolve a bug every 1 to 1.5 hours of play. major issues requiring reload are things like weapons suddenly not being able to be fired, ui elements becoming stuck, and quest objectives not completing. there are a plethora of more minor bugsglitches as well like bad popin, npcs tposing even during story cutscenes, and enemies just standing still doing nothing in combat. overall, it feels like the game quality would be largely the same if the main and side quests were launched from a map a la mass effect 123 rather than having the game be open world. that is really a shame given how breathtaking night city is. that said, the narrative experience really delivers and if that is what you are after the game will be a treat once the bugs are sorted."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"story average and insanely short. choices matter? no they dont or almost not at all. i had no interest in any of the character development including my own. its still pretty buggy not ea, or ubisoft buggy, but very poor from cdpr. i was promised a game that never happened the game fails to deliver everything but graphics assuming you have a setup to take advantage of them which i have fortunately 3090 on 9900k maxed everything psycho ray traced looks amazing sorry all console users not gloating honest sympathy. it looks like cdpr are going for rockstars market and that is insane as the reason most people back them is that they are not like other completely money driven companies. actually they now appear to be because old style cdpr would never release a game that is so far from what they promised in a very broken state. if you just want a nice game to look at on a extremely high end pc then this is a good choice. i felt like i was playing gta 6 not because of the cars but because of the commercialized way they flung this poorly finished effort out. the ending's verge on the disaster that made mass effect rewrite its own appalling endings. if you are going to play a game like this you expect a ending reward that befits your efforts and there are none that are worth your effort. it actually may have started as a project of love but ended as a cash grab. cdpr made its money being a oasis in a sea of filth but has slowly put on its wellington boot and waded into the filth. this is no more than an average game and cdpr never made average"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game is poorly optimized and has few bugs. some even force you to reload the save sometimes, and others can be quite amusing. cd projekt should predict in advance when the game will be ready and set its premiere not earlier than in february. now, despite the fact that the game was not ready in terms of errors and optimization, it was released to avoid the negative feedback from the players that the developers encountered earlier. i kind of understand them, because during the previous postponement of the premiere, even death threats were made on the creators. apart from bugs and optimizations, the story is at the highest level, which is the hallmark of cd projekt red. the number of choices and possible endings of the main and side plots is considerable, which makes it feel like we have an influence on the presented world. the character development and inventory upgrade system is rewarding. the game is graphically high level, but there is no wow effect here. the soundtrack is pleasant to the ear and fits well with the atmosphere of the game. gameplay is pretty good.. driving physics is room for improvement, but the firing and handtohand combat system is really good. if you own a highend pc, i really recommend playing. if you have a slightly weaker pc, it is better to wait until february for the patch fixing the optimization, unless you don't mind playing at 30fps. 810"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"really great game with good optimization pc. cdpr will  lil bit later, calm down."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games of the year if not one of the coolest games ever made. yes there are some bugs on pc but i can't think of a single game that is bug free on a pc release. when you take into account the size and scope of the game i believe the bugs are on the lower side and people are complaining for the sake of complaining.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"fk bugs, it is the best singleplay game i played last 5 years! if don't like it go to hell and get back to grind  in game like valhalla or vomit tlou2. best grafics, best dialogs, grate city and atmosfere i love it!....  ,    ! no any problem on pc r3600, rx6800, 32ram."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"for some reason, i only come across negative news about cyberpunk 2077, and it frustrates me to no end. yes, okay, i get that most bad reviews come from console gamers, and being a pc player i don't have the same amount of problems. yes, the pc version has its bugs too, however, i can easily see past them because i am enjoying the plot, the characters, the missions  main and side ones, the city, the conversations and sense of style of random people in its streets, and i enjoy it all immensely! i haven't finished the game yet, but the 10 hours i spent on it were very enjoyable indeeed. i hope the ending will be as good asthe rest of it. what i can certainly say is that this game and the team who made it deserve much higher praise than they get, unlike the last of us 2 where there were no bugs  but they outright lied to people in their trailers, killed off a beloved character and made the other act like an idiot. i apologize for bringing it up here  but to me, it's unfair how many people protect the last of us 2, how it gets rewards while being such an utter and complete disaster  experience. to conclude, cyberpunk is great, i absolutely love it and i don't care about the bugs. thank you, cdpr, for yet another great game!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,definitely a lot to fix but overall is gorgeous and with a wonderful story and characters
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"preordered the game at the start. my pc specs amd ryzen 7 3700x, msi geforce rtx 2080ti 11gb, 16gb ram, asrock x570. i played on ultra settings with dlss and rtx psycho mode, but even so, the game disappointed me technically. all reflections in the game do not reflect what is happening around, that is, the reflections are rendered in advance. what about the details? the quality of prompts in the game is also not the best. all the small details such as different bottles, garbage and environmental elements for example, food or things found at levels do not correspond to what was shown in early builds. models of v in cutscenes or during the action of the character show all polygons, and npcs still consist of curved elements. the city is very beautiful, like the game itself as a whole, but if you look at the details, you can see how everything is rendered and loaded before our eyes, even on my powerful pc. cars appear out of thin air, and when loading v can pass through other characters. technically, the game is still at the level of the witcher 3 of 2015 or even worse. especially considering everything that the developers showed and promised us, the game can be easily called the most disastrous project in the graphic plan. even look, watch dogs of 2012 was not such a disappointment. physics in the game didn't do well either. the character goes through corpses, does not interact with them in any way. the collision of corpses is also not at the highest level, especially when it comes to the dismemberment of corpses, which works in an incomprehensible way. the character animations are quite elaborate, but this only applies to the main characters and v himself. but the animation of shooting and weapons leaves much to be desired, but since this is an rpg, you can close your eyes to this. there are a lot of bugs in the game and almost all of them spoil the atmosphere and immersion effect. when you are driving through the city at night and listening to punk rock music which fits very well into the atmosphere a car spawns from the sky, gets stuck in a model of your car, and blows you up. the same can be said about missionrelated bugs. which not only interfere but also spoil the overall gameplay. by the way, the gameplay is also not at the highest level, but the number of mechanics and the variability of the passage are amazing. but in some places, it can be quite boring, since half of the side quests are reduced to go, kill or go, bring take it to the point. dialogue and story do not greatly improve the situation. in general, in this regard, the game is significantly inferior to the witcher, where all this was carefully worked out and motivated the player to go through all the quests. in conclusion, i can say that there are a lot of shortcomings in the game and i would not recommend buying it on release, although it deserves attention. there is a very shortage of time and hack in some places. of the advantages, it is possible to note a good, cluster plot and chic composition. better wait for patches or i think the developers had to wait another year or even two because it seems that the cdpr has been engaged in advertising for 6 years, and for the last 2 years they have started to work on the project itself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i am so disappointed with all the hate this game is getting. i have played almost 30 hours and have had zero crashes and only a few almost unnoticeable bugs. the game runs well even with ray tracing on for me, so idk what everyone is complaining about. also it is super fun!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this game is a pure fun masterpiece. some things could use improvement like adding filters for stash, adding the ability to transmog clothes to change their appearance without changing their stats, adding the ability to change appearance ingame either at one location like a plastic surgeon or add it as a option at the ripperdoc or at multiple locations like hair and nails at the hairdresser, eyes at the ripperdoc, tattoos at the tattoo shop and cops spawning from nowhere inside buildings the way police works otherwise i think fits the world because they attack you while you are doing illegal things but if you leave the area they don't care anymore because they are corrupt or not paid enough to care but if you  with them they'l come in force and flatline you quick. don't care about the state of console version or the problems console players have pc master race all the way. pc bugs can and will be patched. only a few bugs were progress blocking and they will probably be patched very quickly. some of these few bugs that some people would call progress blocking but i wouldn't prevent you to do some things with shards if you for example do something with a shard at the beginning of a quest instead of the end or do a quest before advancing the main story more and try to do something with a shard. these bugs with shards don't cause any blocking of quest progress but could be theoretically categorized in gameplayprogress blocking bugs since what the shards offer could be useful. all other bugs are visual only and they don't affect my immersion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"when this game does not run at 20 fps on my rtx 2060 with all settings tweaked at the lowest, it is an average blurry buggy 3rd rate looter shooter. i have spent 3 hours in game trying each setting to hopefully get an fps boost with no result. the lifepath choices do not matter whatsoever and the rpg elements are weaker than fallout 4. gun play is average and the loot is uninspiring. the npcs are some of the worst i have seen in ages in an rpg and the ai leaves a lot to be desired. only positives are the interesting characters and the environment cdpr should have delayed this for another year at least for optimization, debugging and fleshing out the features. really disappointed and hoping for them to turn this around, like what happened with no man's sky. only time will tell, but it's a real shame for such a lost opportunity and a real dark mark for cdpr... edit managed to fix the performance issues by installing ms visual studio, but the rest are still an issue than needs fixing. updating the score."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"artistic aspects of the game are really great night city, models, music!, story is ok, yeah it has many many bugs, which eventually can be fixed altough it matters, i spent 60 to have a working game now, not in 3 months... anyway..., but the things they advertised that are now missing, the lack of any ai whatsoever... it's just unforgivable"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i'm not the biggest rpg fan. i have played witcher 3, fallout 3 and new vegas. i played 80 hours in outer worlds and s 100 hours of skyrim and i am saying that this is the best rpg i have ever played and would argue that its the best one anyone has played, considering the bugs and the mess at launch. i still cant look in the mirror with a hat without my character appearing bald, but the fact they lied about the base console launch which is inexcusable and the bugs that i myself have experienced i cannot give it a perfect score. i will say that even with the glitches i experienced i don't care it did not hinder my experience so i might have to save and load a few extra times to get it right and i know its not the players fault that they bought it on console thinking it would run good or at least ok but any person with any pc and technical knowledge could tell you that that console would make the game suffer and that being said either get a refund or buy a next gen console is what you can do or pc. i am lucky although my pc isn't no top of the line premium build but it did meet minimum and even some of the higher minimum requirements so i was gonna get for base console but was lucky to have both a decent pc and an xbox one s and the knowledge to know that there was no way it would run good on the base consoles so i'm sorry for those who didn't, but for me the game is fantastic and i dare you to point me to a better rpg excluding skyrim i haven't played it in like ten years or so, and don't give me this fallout 2  it worked good at launch and are considered some of the best rpgs but i don't care its 2020 and i want the best and newest in the gaming market and if are reading this review thank you hopefully you enjoyed my rant and opinions."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this game is absolutely amazing from graphics and sound perspective. i am playing this with 4k and 7.1 surround sound and i can tell just how much work went into sound design for this game. all the dialog, all the interactive animations really make this game a next gen game. if you have a ps5, this is the game to get. its too sad they had to pull it from the play store because some people couldn't afford a ps5 or a high end pc. but is this really the developer's fault? how many times have they released backward compatible games for xbox or ps2 when 360 and ps3 versions were readily available. were they buggy? yes. did they cause developers to lose their savings in the company and possibly their jobs, not to mention thousands of hours of work and lost sleep? so before you continue to bash projekt red, just keep in mind that it is your own limitations that are keeping you from enjoying this game, it has nothing to do with the game or the developers. it seems like all the complaints that people have with this game are the it is not gta 6. please play the game the way it was meant to be played, stop trying to issues that aren't there. are we going to turn on developers just because they didn't make a game the way you demanded?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i will not focus on the bugs  cdpr has promised to fix them soon though their promises don't really mean much anymore, considering how many promised features have suddenly disappeared ala no man's sky. i will focus on the gameplay itself. it's a decent casual game. it is, unfortunately, not an rpg game. there is no customizability after charactercreation. you can't even look at yourself during the game, unless you 'turn on' a mirror. your cars, apartment, hair, makeup, bodyparts, etc., were all promised customization features that somehow disappeared from the final game. further, your choices in dialogue and quest approach have zero effect on the outcome of the game. the game is frustratingly linear, and your decision to kill everyone, hack everyone, or negotiate your way out of quests really doesn't matter. the same outcome occurs. the only saving grace is the character development and quest storyline."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"es un gran juego con gran lore y buenos personajes. night city es impresionante un avance tecnologico que nunca se a visto visualmente, su narrativa puede que este a la par con witcher 3 o quizs mas arriba. un rpg que quizs no es muy profundo pero se vuelve muy adictivo y cumple con divertirte y variar. respecto a lo malo se nota que el juego no esta terminado del todo y tuvieron que tapar agujeros a ultimo minuto por sucumbir ante la presin. por otra parte, los bugs, hay muchos bugs visuales y de gameplay que como repito tuvieron que tapar a ultimo minuto a mi parecer, pero aun as no es nada que rompa el juego y lo haga injugable. en conclusin para mi no es un juego perfecto ni de 10 porque tiene sus fallas y sus mecanicas que no estan muy pulidas y su ia como sus valores de daos no lo hacen demasiado inmersivo, solo en ese sentido, pero de resto es excelente."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"it's a rpg so first i wanna talk about story , characters and immersion. story is amazing , i like the overall topic and execution of that topic. a little bit too short for me but cdpr said it will be a shorter game than witcher 3. nonetheless the short story doesn't help to bond with characters imho. characters are well created , with their own interesting backstory and problems. immersion is a hard thing to achieve because of bugs and glitches. world is smaller than i expected and this is one of the biggest downsides for me. sometimes it feels really real and alive and sometimes it feels like a bad copycat of some gta . now to more gameplay and mechanics stuff. i want to point out that shooting from guns and overall use of weapons feels really good , especially if you consider that cdpr never done fps before and they used for this game their own engine. the same thing applies for driving in cp77. cars are different and are made for different terrains. many cars have a problem that while driving at high speed they tend to act like a soap in a bathtub. irritating but not game breaking and there are some weird bugs in case of calling your car or hitting some things with your car. in the case of ai and npcs , there are a lot of unfulfilled promises , that's the second biggest downside for me. they are just stupid with iq of a room temp. i think it can be patched out but the problem right now is just the overall numbness of npcsai and their reactions to what the player is doing to them or around them. let's talk about something that is executed by cdpr perfectly , that's graphics. the quality of textures , reflections and lightning is breathtaking. adding this photomode was a great decision from cdpr. i found myself just stopping and taking some shots. actually taking photos was more distracting from the game than the bugs itself. faces of characters are very detailed , clothing is great and looks almost real. i also really like the overall design of implants , and vehicles. interiors of cars are really well created and once again detailed. every place and scene in cp77 has their own little things happening , it's full of everything and details. amazing how cdpr perfected the imperfections of location they have put in the game. also i wanted to say something about interfaces. it's very minimalistic and fits with the topic and climate of the game but i have few objections. minimap is really small , too small. and i don't mean the window of the map is small , the amount of content it shows is just too small. i really often missed a turn or didn't see where i should go. an implant interface is really nice , like how it shows you a xray of your v and the way it's all presented. i was slightly disappointed when the changes i made did not change anything with this visualization of the human body. maybe devs will add it , but now they have a much bigger problem to solve. overall equipment interface is clear and easy to use. the only thing missing for me is weapon preview. there were plenty of situations where i just kept switching scopes because they had some weird color and didn't match the rest . in case of skills and skilltrees , cdpr went wild. 5 different trees , with 2 or more different subcategories. if you're worried about if your style of playing is implemented in game , there is a big chance it is. there are plenty of quests, you won't be bored if you like to stop and do stuff. i have one negative thing to say about main story quests. i feel like there are just a few. too few. this is connected to my problem with the length  and it makes sense why there is this amount of quests but still , after the first time playing i was baffled by how fast the main story flew between my fingers. i also would divide sidequests into two types. one that has behind them a long and interesting quest line and the other that are much shorter but still have some interesting and funny  short , if you don't plan to speedrun cp77 and just explore the world. now i wanted to say something to all those people that just cry how cyberpunk is a bugged and awful game , worst in history and other  like that. first , it's pretty childish to base a review not on the actual game but on your feelings. if you are mad at cdpr for not keeping all promises , then go back and stand in line. i'm also mad how the game isn't a revolution in the gaming industry and how cp77 is unpolishedbugged in many ways. and i don't blame you for being angry , i blame you for being angry just to be angry. the moment when gamers started throwing rocks at death stranding for cooperation with cdpr , that was the moment i realized , you are angry just to be angry. it's sad to watch how cdpr is drowning because you just need to scream and cry about the game that promised everything gave you only a lot. peace and happy playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"first and foremost this is my pc review and i am running an intel i9 10th gen with an rtx 3080. i would also like to note that while i did see a lot of the promotional material for the game i did not expect too much going in. i have had numerous bugs and glitches happen but as someone who grew up playing bethesda games this is no different for me. i am docking the game by a point because of the number of bugs and missing systems. it is true that the ai is nothing to write home about but i have seen worse in recent games. i like to try and match this game up against my alltime favorite pc game vampire the masquerade bloodlines. both games are based on tabletop rpgs and both games launch with a massive amount of bugs. cyberpunk 2077 is lacking in new systems like appearance customization after you start the game and a more indepth background system as we saw in the 2018 e3 demo. though hopefully yjose could be added later. the lawforce system is also kinda disappointing as the police just appear out of nowhere at times. though none of these affected what i was truly after in the game. the three best things i think both cyberpunk and vampire did well was the writing, the story, and the characters you meet along the way. night city is also an amazing character itself. the design and look of the city is breathtaking. i also really enjoyed the badlands outside of night city. a lot of these characters in the game that you do side quests with feel real and make the city come alive. i think cdpr knocked it out of the park with the art and writing but it could have used more time in the oven to expand systems and fix bugs. i think they should have done what rockstar does. focus on their primary system of choice which was clearly pc and release the console versions at a later date. overall fantastic game with a lotta love poured into it by the developers. remeber the developers are not the ones who decide when to release but the board of directors. blame the right people."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,i really enjoyed it. a bit short tho. but the story and characters are exceptional. finishing the game felt like a break up for me.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"good game with good story line, engaging and fun side activities, and the most impressive graphics i've seen in a video game. but the game as major flaws even on pc, the worst are the npc ai which is non existent and the wanted system. the npc are really badly scripted and have basically one hardcoded action for every interaction with them, shoot they will run, throw a grenade they will crouch, park your car in the middle of the street the cars will just wait for you to move they cant go around you, talk to them they will answer about the weather or something completly out of context. really often you will see pedestrians doing one single action in loop such as walking back and forth from point a to point b, or a motorcycle going in circle. if you do any crime in outside of predetermined combat zone, it will put the wanted status on you. doesn't matter if someone saw or heard you or not. the police will literally spawn 10 feet away from you, most often in your back and will start shooting at you. if you enter a car and drive one block away you will lose the wanted status, even if the police still see's you, there's no police chase in the game. other minor issues are bugs, alot of bugs and unfinished content. you will encounter many things that are unfortunately really immersion breaking environment areas not completed, physics issues, falling through the floor, cars flying not purposely, npcs floating, t poses, npc's cars and environmental objects collisions, animation loops, unfinished unpolished cutsceens, and the list goes on and on. i would easily go over the maximum characters limit for this review if i listed everything i personally encountered during my playthrough which was after the day one patch by the way. many things that were promised and even shown during the development aren't there in this build. this game needed many additional months of development to be the game that was promised marketed and be the game it should've been. if you are looking for a masterpiece, this is not the one. if you are looking for a single player action game, with a good story and interesting nonrepetitive side activities this might just be the game for you if you're willing to look over the bugs and the unfinished unpolished content you will encounter every now and then. night city isn't the place we were promised but is worth visiting."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this review will not take into account the bugs ou performance issues. just the game itself. the game is great, but far away from a masterpiece. did it live up to the hype? short answer, no. but regardless, it's a great game and i do recommend it if your are a rpg fan, the main quests are great and cdpr storytelling is as usual, top notch. the characters are deep and complex and this is alone a great experience. now for the bad parts, there are clearly many mechanics and content that were removed from the game to save time, i suspect. this game needed another year, at least, to be all it can be or all we all hope it would be. the inventory is a mess, to find some object if you need to review a clue, is almost impossible. the message and shard index are also terrible. i'm very confident that cdpr will fix this game and make a great number of improvements in the next months, but right now, i gave it a 8 out of 10."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i had a blast playing the game, main quest line is addictive and moving, characters are great written, the fighting is engining and has a great feeling, and city is stunning, but the best thing is the world, world where the line between the human and machine is blurry or non existing, the world full of poverty and degradation, the world filled with adds brainwashing you and squeezing every penny out of you. the only reason this game isn't a 10 is bugs lots of them, for there were mostly graphics bugs that took me out of experience, but there were some game breaking too. i believe that after the bugs are fixed they will for sure this game will be one of the greatest games in history at least for me.i think people were expecting cybperpunk gta, instead they got withercher but in cyberpunk game where npc don't metter they are there just for the looks nothing else, same as in withecher. it's not gta in the future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,this game is simply stunning.. everything looks great and makes you feel like you are really in night city.. you can play hours and it would looks like a film.. verything makes sense and the story is breathtaking . 100100

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"as it comes to the world created, the way it looks the way it feels i think this game is a complete hit and has exceeded my expectation. even the experience of walking down a crowded street in night city especially now that we're all locked down cause of the pandemic is really awesome. i like the story and the writing is good, the world feels complex, and the characters are developed in a way that has depth... it gives a good enough illusion to feel immersed in the world of cyberpunk 2077. graphically the game is stunning but what is better is the attention to detail in models and locations which really feel very real. performance seems to be an issue for some , i'll just preface that i have not had issues but i play it on a reasonable pc, it is not the latest greatest  i99900k  rtx 2080 ti but it is quite decent. at ultra 3440  1440 works well enough not to notice issues. my framerates were in the 45 fps range with dlss enabled. some will cringe that 45 is low , but for a single player game, trying to experience the story and have it look stunning, this works well for me. and personally until i enabled the fps counter in steam i had no idea what the value is but my senses can't really tell the difference between 60 or 45 so at this point fps is just a number. i'm sure there will be optimization fixes which will make this run better. what is important is that the writing is good, the story is immersive, and nc feels real ... this is a really good game, and i would strongly recommend it as it is worth it"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"a brilliant, expansive and deep game left down by bugs and mediocre optimisation. the world is fascinating as are the npcs and game mechanics. walking amongst the crowds and driving through the traffic really does impress how busy night city is. combat isenjoyable and all combat styles are viable whether it be stealth, melee, short range, long range and hacking heavy. i am having a lot of fun, and hope they fix the game further to bring it to a well deserved 9 or 10."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"an average linear openworld rpg with a poor story, weak characters and  of bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game on pc has bugs but it does not ruin the experience, i played it for 15 hours and found bugs but not very serious, i never crashed the game, but it is a lottery. maybe someone else's game is full of bugs, in my case i enjoy it. but it does not even reach the heels of what cdpr promised, the ai is bad, it only has 5 endings, it does not matter as much as they said the decisions you make. the city feels empty in some places, and the secondary missions are still commissions and if they are missions with a short story, the combat can become annoying. in conclusion it is a good game, it is not what was promised but it is good. if they fix the bugs and the performance on pc  consoles, it will be a very good game, but it will not be the masterpiece that they promised us...."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"yes this game has its flaws.... there are many errors, crashing, and bugs however this is an amazing game. the visual in this game are mind blowing followed by an amazing story. the customization and different builds and options are also incredible. this game is a 1010 in its current state but it could be a 1210."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this is a pc game not for consoles, if you want to evaluate the console versions go there. i don't understand people who give it zero. it will never be a game of zero. you have a scale of 0 to 10 and you give her 0 super intelligence"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"amazing game story, rpg elements are on point but i do feel you dont actually have any choice in what you do or say, mostly everything goes exactly the same way as with another option. it's all style but no substance. your personal backstory is forgettable. it's literally 20 mins long, and your entire introduction to night city is a montage. cdpr failed the show, don't tell aspect. they could've squeezed in a few good hours of character development and worldbuilding with the opening hours. instead, you get taken straight into night city, told to care about certain things, and want to have this lofty ideal of becoming a living legend for some unknown reason. you don't have a story to tell, there's a story being told to you.  m'gato on steam, which i completely agree with i've played 30 hours, but wont play more because the game is horribly optimized and as a developer, i do not approve what cdpr is doing at the moment. 710 at best at this current state, but 010 for how things are going with the console release. next year if and when there is a goty edition i know there will be, i believe the game will be totally different. i suggest you wait until half a year to a year to play this!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"lot of style, little substance. cyberpunk 2077 has an engaging main story line with some standout characters and neat moments virtual reality segments are especially well done, but it falls completely flat in terms of its world and the quality of its side content. night city is so empty and superficial that it resembles more the annual versions of far cry or assassin's creed rather than any of rockstar games' works from the past years. in fact, gta 3 released in 2001 had more advanced simulation systems in many aspects than this game. while the main story deserves praise, it is also important to note that due to the incoherent experience that you get out of your time in night city as a whole, cyberpunk becomes a far cry no pun intended from truly exceptional storydriven games from the recent past, such as the last of us, god of war, but even the more actionoriented control or quantic dreams' surprisingly strong and coherent detroit become human. bugs and terribly shading marketing aside, cyberpunk just does not live up to the lofty standards cdpr set for the game. there is definitely fun to be had here, but it is high time gamers stop treating this studio as the sacred cow of the gaming industry and that gaming outlets provide honest and straightforward criticism instead of vacuous hype  which has definitely been the case leading up to this lackluster game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i created an account just to post this review lots of reviews here are saying no life choices not next gen gta is better, well let me give you my 2 cups after 25hours, i have completed only around 12 main missions after the main heist, all rest of my time went into finding interesting things, and oboy there is alot of them, from sweet sweet hacks that can make some one suicide to a full johnny wick suite, the game has an amazing amount of details into it. the side missions are some of the most shocking  randy key quest line  or the peralez's quest line. there are gems every where. yes there are bugs and not small amount of them, but every game  not cod that is same same every year  has bugs maybe more then other bit with the amount of details that went into the game that's not the worst there is. cyberpunk was hyped for a reason and the reason is still there the game is amazing. dont like it? return it, mixed feelings? pass 10hours and see then how you feeling about this game. love it? more is on the way!!. thanks guys"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"unique, addictive masterpiece, comparing cyberpunk to gta games is like comparing shooting in it against call of duty, driving against forza horizon etc  just a nonsense. its pretty sad that people dont even know what game genre they compare to, basing just on open world aspect against massively boring gta, in one word  snowflakes. can't wait for dlc's, good job !"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"limited character customization in a game whose futuristic culture is that anyone can be anything, the customization options are extremely limited to a few preset body parts. there are no synthetic parts and no body types to choose from. worst of all, there is no option to change your appearance. nowhere does it say that making your character is final and cannot be changed. chose a crappy hair color due to the bad lighting in the character creator room? you are stuck with it for life. seriously, in a game that advertised adversity and extravagant futuristic styles, you expect an option to change appearance. there is absolutely no point as to why we can't change looks. changing looks wasn't a technical difficulty, but rather a stupid omission by cdpr. no character freedom, background or story your background has zero effect on... pretty much everything. the only thing that changes is the first few minutes of the introduction and a few dialogue options that lead to the same outcome anyway. so, you wanted to make a nomad and reach night city. be someone from the outside, with no connections, who is trying to make his luck in this megalopolis? it doesn't matter. as soon as you finish the intro, you instantly become best buddies with jackie welles and every sneaky fixer in the city suddenly trusts you with very sensitive missions. you are given a nice apartment, a car, a unique gun and money. there is absolutely no rpg element in this kind of scenario. no matter who you choose to be, a cutscene commences that bypasses all rpg elements building trust with other characters and throws you in a linear story path. after the intro, whether you chose to be corpo or a streetkid, you are exactly the same. you wake up in the same apartment and proceed to the rest of the game the same. beautiful yet soulless world night city is amazing visually. flashing screens with crazy ads, flying drones, futuristic cars, amazing interiors, extravagant people walking its streets. the basis is there. unfortunately, that's all there is to it. nice to the eye. the npcs can't be interacted with. they also don't interact with their environment. just slashed someone with a katana? well, the sushi seller next to him keeps selling sushi, and the beggar casually repeats the same begging for money dialogue. no immersion!! which leads to the game having little to no immersion. no matter what you do, nothing responds to you. there is no feedback from the environment. you park your car on the sidewalk, and because you slightly touch the road, cars pause and form a gigantic line behind you. nobody attempts to bypass you. they just stay there like soulless dolls. they stand in the middle  fight, they don't run, they don't take cover. npcs have nothing to say or do.  food stalls and other shops are just passive inventory vendors. bars, clubs and restaurants are obsolete since they only have an inventory npcbartender to transfer items. there is no interacting, no sitting, no drinking, no eating, no relaxing and taking in the environment at a bench. there are no animations of drinking, eating, going to a ripperdoc. everything is just transfer ui. there's no crafting bench. you just craft things with 1click. where is the immersion in this?  in such a dark themed world where plastic boob ads and halfnaked people are everywhere, there is absolutely nobody to hook up with. just 2 joytoys that instantly transfer you into a 10 seconds clip of you having sex with them. it feels like they are there just to say that you can have sex in the trailers.  drug dealers sell literal candies, sodas and fruits. where is smoking? where is snorting crazy expensive drugs? with animations! there's no vehicle customization or dealerships. seriously? where is the futuristic tuning? in depth car modification?  no apartment choice. there's also no customization in your apartment at all. on their trailers they showed a clip where you actually get to choose a rich villa if you want to live the high life. lies.  no gang reputation, nochoosing a gang and killing for them, no affiliations with dangerous people. no karma system. no appropriate to your choices reactions by people.  no sense of fear walking in the city. you can punch a musclebound freak npc and they run like scared chickens. or cybercrouch and cower indefinitely.  no minigames! is it so hard to play some slots? game machines are everywhere. is it so hard to play some poker in a small room behind a bar? where are darts or a pool table. these minigames could add hundreds of hours of gameplay.  driving is on rails  taking the camera away and looking back, it spawns different npcs.  police system doesn't exist  stealth doesn't work this lack of interactiveness ultimately makes the world feel hollow. it feels dead. it feels unfinished. it feels like a linear action shooter. like call of duty in the future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"written by a cdprojekt big fan. i finished all the witchers, i played gwent and thronebreaker. cyberpunk 2077 is the biggest failure of professional critics that ever happened in the vg industry. this game is simply not finished to be kind. the city looks completely dead with one of the worst ai of the decade or maybe of the last two decades. hordes of lifeless mannqueins are invading the streets crashing into you with no facial expressions and with a very few bad movesets. the traffic is embarassing, not only because of the, again, emabrassing ai, but because it's completely inaccurate for a big metropolis like nigh city the most of the times you can find 2 or 3 cars on the streets. once i saw a video of a lifeless very big city built by the chinese gov in africa, that's the closest thing that night city reminds me. if accidentally you leave your car somewhere near the road you'll cause the block of the entire road like in gta vice city. the game is also repetitive, the feedback of the shooting is ok while the melee one is very bad, like the skyrim one 10 years ago. the driving experience is one of the worst ever regarding free roaming  interactions you can have in the city are very few ad again, no car, no interactions and very bad ai give you the impression of living in something that is not finished, something fake. just a banal thing, but let you understand the level of immersion there is no way to edit your hair or makeup in game after you created the character, not even a shop in the entire city. the creation itself is made with a standard editor which is not revolutionary at all, i'm not negative or positive regarding this last one. the problem is not that is just a bad or unfinished game, but that is also full of bugs that are heavily undermining the game experience and the immersion .... one funny thing about this one a friend of mine the day of the launch is telling me i could encounter a bug of my character with his ps outside of his pants in the menu because . and yes, of course i wait 8 years for a game, i buy it and i experience this bug, i have my ps outside of my pants, but i thought ok, who cares, they're gonna fix this. the list of bugs i encountered is long and luckily i didn't encounter all the bugs i saw online. a few bugs i encountered npcs getting stuck, character is naked in some scenes while he shouldn't, interface errors, characters around me are disappearing and appearing again, sound is suddenly going off, errors in car visual. i didn't have much time, so this review will be probable full of mistakes, but i wanted you to warn you. don't believe the hype. i asked for a refund to cdprojekt and i hope and think they'll gonna listen to us. bye!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i have a feeling that this whole  is because he's going to see a photorealistic game on his crap hardware, it's a great game for me, i have a lot of fun playing it. the errors i encounter do not negatively affect the gameplay. there were bigger mistakes in the games of the competition, but nobody bothered with that. see fallout, mass efect, no men sky. in my opinion, this game is in much better shape than i expected from the heat of criticism. it was a mistake to release this game on the old generation consoles. this is a cdpr error. they shouldn't be doing this. but the game as such is great and i highly recommend it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"increble el robo que recibimos por parte de cd proyect red los usuarios de ps4 esto tiene nombre y se llama estafa ,te has cado del pedestal muy mala gestin nunca ms cd"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"failed to deliver on the basics, the open world is shallow and lifeless, the rpg almost nonexistent und its just not fun. all i wanted is an immersive world and some story to go along, but it fails on it's promise. it's just underwhelming and i wasn't even hyped to begin with. sad days for cdpr."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"super flawed and buggy experience, missing 70 percent of promised features."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"personally i am into this game. it was a lot to take in at first but when i got to the opening credits i was hooked. pros gameplay i feel like beatrix kiddo with my hattori hanzo sword. no issues here for me. graphics amazing, great detail. story captivating and engrossing. cons a few bugs here and there though not too much of an issue for me as long as you don't go looking for them, poor traffic ai, at first i thought it was a blurry mess though once i tweaked my hdr settings and graphics options to my liking, it looks amazing. i think you have to play this game with a linear mindset in an open world. but a big thumbs up for me, i know how hard the developer worked on the witcher 3 after release so i have every confidence in the to sort out the issues. i just feel back for all the people not having the patience to give them a couple of months to sort things."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,i've been playing on pc so i don't have the same bugs and glitches as console people. very good story and i'm really enjoying it so far. don't try to run the game on a last gen console. it won't go well.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"playing with an rtx 3070 the game runs smooth as butter. a few bugs and glitches here and there, but i have yet to encounter anything game breaking or broken after my 80 hours of playing. from what ive seen the pc version is definitely the most polished and bug free. if you have the hardware i highly recommend cyberpunk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i was not really waiting for this game, but once i have played it it is absolutely fantastic. the atmosphere of this city is just amazing. comparing to gta5 it is better in all areas  better visuals, addictive additional activities and those flashy neon lights during nigh  i'm pc player for 20 years and never have seen game with such climatic experience. main story is mainly linear but extremely well done. side quests are entertaining and complex. everything have a space here. also, i play on ultra settings on 4 years pc i5 6600k and gtx1070 and there is no visible frame drops. sometimes there are some bugs  like some texture is missing or npc body is behaving strangely after you kill him but that does not break gameplay in any way and as with all games today will be patched soon. for me this is one of best rpg games off all times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i tried to run the game on a 3070360048gb3200 setup and although sometimes the game played resonably well it oftentimes crashed and had random framedrops that made the game impossible to enjoy. i thought i would get the refund they promised to keep gamers happy and get the new cod instead and revisit cp2077 sometime next year when they would hopefully have resolved the problems. yeah, i wished they  me over another time, this is the reponse i got from the company i bought the game at please note that cd project red's statement on refunds covers the console version of the game, not the pc version. we have been instructed by cd project red's distributor to allow refunds solely for the console version of the game. this is the last time i buy anything cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,it's a good looking game with lots of good side quests but there are lots of content missing from the game and it keeps reminding me of gta v this is due to the rpg element in the game is very weak and around 15 hours into the game you will start feeling that you are overpowered since you can get the legendary cybernetic pretty easy. doing gigs and bounties gets your street cred to lvl 50 pretty fast and easy but what comes after that is nothing. you stop getting perks from street cred. pretty interesting idea with the game but the execution of the game was really bad like i said lots of content showed at earlier gameplays and promises made by devs like the ai would be smart and do a different task or the hacking that was shown was so much better than what you got with the game. plain simple cyberpunk is a very stripped version of what was shown and promised by the developers. don't know how 7 years into development gets you a buggy game with the worst ai ever seen. i would recommend to stay away from the game for a year and see what the devs will do next for the game before you buy this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"it's not a game, it's the biggest lie in high budget game industry comparable only to star citizen. it's a total buggy mess without optimization, without stable gameplay mechanics, without interesting full ov events open world. that all was promised to us, but in the end we have only flatulent name of cyberpunk that has no elaborate sense of that cyberpunk style. shame on you, cdpr. you should never try to make this game, you just puke in the air and lied to all of us. choke with your dirty money."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"yes, the game is buggy on release on all platforms but that isn't actually the biggest issue. the biggest group of issues the game has is that it lacks the very basic baseline expected of an open world rpg. there is novery little ability to customise your character after creation, no barber for example. the ai for the civilians, police and enemies is... severely lacking and is likely actually just a placeholder. for example, as of patch 1.04 npcs can and will spawndisappear as long as they are not in your view... e.g. police can spawn 0.1 meters behind you because they aren't in your cone of vision. cdpr misled their audience, the game was built to be very marketable with stuff put in specifically to feature in trailers lots of prerendered long cutscenes presented as gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i'm aware of the many flaws and unkept promises for the game. i'm counting that some of them will be fixed such as ai and police issues, others will most likely remain a disappointment. nevertheless the game delivers a fantastic experience and sets new standards for world design and exposition. i can't bring myself to care about  like lack of barber shops. on a decent pc the game feels like a truly next gen title, and really first one like that. technical problems i could care less about as they will be fixed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"gamespot was right! honestly... it's not even the bad optimization, the bugs, the unpolished look. the world feels baren... feels like it's all hollow, behind the surface. you can't do anything. you don't deliberately get jumped by anyone unless you come close to someone that, for not liking your face, starts shooting you. there are no activities. i mean... yesterday i was driving from the badlands, to the city. i drove in through a major avenue, full speed. for more than one minute i drove inside the city. not a single person was around. not a single car was around. i brake and... magic... things start appearing. it's all just so surreal... the physics are horrible. honestly, comparing this game to the likes of rdr or even gta v, is just a joke. i still have fun with the game. there are things that are interesting and cool... but all in all... it's just a broken game, with no content behind the surface. so... given i was really expecting a lot... this is, without a doubt, the biggest disappointment on my gaming life which is quite long.... cdpr lost my faith in them. period"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"don't know why everyone is bashing this game. i just finished the story yesterday and it was one of the best games i have ever played. i also did not encounter that many bugs, way less than what everyone is saying it has."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"by far the best openworld game i have played. sure it have bugs, but it is in no way as bad as many pretend it is. i have not had a single crash or had to reload because of a bug. so already this is a lot better than any bethesda game ever released. the bugs i have seen are a car floating a few centimetres above ground, weapons floating as well, a few objects held in the hand of a npc not being where they should be. i have completed the game by playing main quests only and is now at my second playthrough so i can confidently state that the game is way less buggy than every single elder scrolls game i have played all of them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"despite the significant amount of bugs and glitches, after having played over 40 hours on a base ps4 i have to say this game phenomenal but still with a lot of space to improve, which im certain they will do like with their previous games. 1010 and waiting impatiently for the next big updates and expansions in the future !"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"well, in this moment i have 45 hours played, and i played very side quests, explored a lot the world, and i have to say, this game is about all the experience, immersion and, obviously, choices. for me is a very, very good game, i really appreciate this. i don't had the opportunity to play in consoles, but, in pc, is one of most beauty thinks i ever see. i had some bugs, almost all of then is about visuals or something like this, a little bit is really inconvenient, forcing me reload the game, one or two times, but i really think this will be fixed, actually very games are released with some bugs, and then they are fixed, like rdr2 online, for example . perhaps, in consoles, this game looks absolutely unplayable, but my note is about the pc version and my experience about the game for now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i was promised a new gen game, with a great story line and immersive as it could be. 1010 i was blown away. played on pc full ultra graphics. a few bugs, but really not something that can ruin the experience or something like that. finished it 2 times now and on my 3rd run. thank you cdpr!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"playing it on ps4 pro. not the best performance, but that doesn't mean it's a flop. side quests are entertaining, the story is awesome. i'm enjoying it a lot. from here on it can only improves, i mean, at least cdpr is working on fixing their mistakes, not like other big companies."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"pc  45hrs  street kid path  7.510  spoiler free review first things first, i have to put it out that i am an rpg, grand strategies, moba and indie player. thus, my hopes for the game were higher for the typical rpg aspects and lower for the shootingcombat aspects as i dont like fps games. optimalisation sadly, here on the launch we all were met with harsh reality, the advertised high was new low. do not even want to mention what old gen consoles had to experience. that was false advertising to get people to buy a game that their pc  laptops  consoles would not be able to run. also bugs. annoying and sometimes game breaking bugs graphics now here we have something good to say. the neons, the shades, the looks the graphics. this is truthfully an eyegasm. even with meteoker settings it was a joy to look at night city, especially on panoramic! wonderful views that are indeed breathtaking. although rendering sometimes lagged behind music another bulls eye just like in witcher 3, cdpr amazed us with music that just does it. the combat music, the radio, the cut scenes  it just hits you there. great work! animation now for the animations it good. however, it doesnt match the witcher 3 quality. sometimes i really thought that the character models were just broken. the mouth animation is also missed. it lags a bot behind the real time which after some time becomes noticeable and quite annoying. however, there are some advances, especially when it comes to character movement during talks  walks it feels very natural and not  artificial like in other rpgs. voice over i do think that voice overs are very subjective however i often had a feeling that vs or other characters lines were  out of charactersituation. it really annoyed me. however not as much as keanu. i am really sorry but as much as i love the guy his voice was stale and empty. it lacked engagement, passion, or emotions. combat cdpr has done it. the combat really differs from the w3 format of just spam rightclick to win. weaponry varies it has its ups and downs and there is depth to it! its genuinely enjoyable! moreover, multiclassing is easy and genuinely a core to the game. the hacking is also amazing! quick hacks are done the way watchdogs should have done it in the 1st place! progression system it was a good concept, however the execution failed in some places. while perks for damage or hacks are great, the system of need 6 in this category to sue this dialog option is bad. it does not add anything or change while requiring levels. however, use of the stats to unlock faster progression in instances is a great idea! ai sadly, the ai is lacklustre, teleports and spawns behind you and is generally annoying. while the prespawned npcs are absolutely opposite and are great  especially guars and their patrol mechanics. i do hope it will get tweaked as it really annoys the player. story line its great, cdpr made it once again and shown that they know their stuff. both main story and side quests which i really recommend you do fully are great and flesh out the world. to be honest the story asks questions that are hard for us and it makes you uncomfortable which is great! it has an impact on you. however the way the act 1prologue are treated is a crime and joke. the part when we meet jackie and develop our bond should not be sped up as it is in game. it was an unnecessary treatment. characters once again, great job! each character has its motives, way of talking, movement, quirks they are unique which really helps to immerse in this world. it really enjoyable to develop the side story lines and flesh out the world even more. will not say more, just try it for yourself. immersion a good job, but not a great one. the city feels alive but with hours it becomes more and more of a husk. lack of customization in game beside clothing and interaction with the casual world hurt the immersion effect i the world. i do hope it will be remodeled as it was later on with w3 too but so far it really bothers me. romances now, listen cdpr. i have never been so disappointed with in game romances as i was in this game. they are uneven, with only 4 on the board. from them all only 1 feels fully developed while the other 3 are just a throwaway and feel so . artificial and forced. few more quests and it would be so much better! also, the sex scenes in first person were a mistake. huge one. endings god damnit, they made me cry again. even that i reached the final mission way early do not rush main story please and focused on side missions after i felt crushed by the endings. absolutely trashed. they are heavy. because they affect us out of the game too. i do hope that they will be followed in the future dlcs because this is a harsh way to finish the story and we need more"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i can't see any reason that justifies cyberpunk 2077 being openworld rather than linear. there is a very good game at the heart of cyberpunk but it is buried under a deluge of padding, poor ai, an archaic loot system, and bugs. you start the game by customising your character and choosing a lifepath. appearance and gender affect your romance options while the lifepath gives you one of 3 introductions along with differing dialogue options down the line. once the intro is over, the 3 lifepath stories coalesce into an engaging story about a mcguffin biochip, weaving in and out of the major cyberpunk themes. as a fan of the genre, i found the main story and most of the side quests to be fascinating and the most engaging parts of the game. unfortunately, there are a lot of preriferal objectives and activities surrounding the quality missions that weigh down the experience as a whole. the map is plastered with icons that represent activities of varying quality. unfortunately, most will see you going to a location and killing some people with little context beyond they are bad guys. these activities will be framed by soulless phone calls and end with money and exp materialising in your pocket. it is blatant padding, present to give the illusion that night city is a place where stuff happens, while in reality there isn't much going on at all. at a glance, the city is gorgeous, sporting all of the neon and mismatched architecture a cyberpunk city should have. yet the inhabitants of night city are mostly mindless drones. seriously, the ai of pedestrians and drivers is driver 3 levels of basic. pedestrians have a stock crouch animation when things get violent and there seems to be no variation in their responses to your actions. the most glaring routines are those of the children. they wander around, unaccompanied, doing nothing. in the witcher 3, kids would play tag, kick around in the mud and gawp at geralt's swords. why are these kids now so emotionless and why are they all missing their guardians? things only get worse when you start driving. the only response other drivers ever have is to stop their vehicles and beep the horn. park your car slightly off the curb? cars will stop even when there's space to go around and beep their horn. crash into a van at 120mph, they will stop and beep their horn. shoot at them.. they don't really do anything when you do that actually but you get the idea. i am not a huge gta fan but i have to admit, rockstar nails pedestrian ai. seeing the various reactions of crowds is one of the many joys an openworld city can provide. without it the world feels so superficial. this feeling extends to the available cars too. cars cannot be customised and are pretty much just a cosmetic option. yes, they have differing speeds but the layout of night city does not lend itself to fast driving and the car controls are average at best. this wouldn't bother me too much, but flying cars are present throughout the game, so it's pretty galling that you never get your hands on one or customise an existing car to fly. as an rpg there is also an in depth levelling system. there are over a dozen perk trees to fill out with the general buffs and upgrades you would expect, like increase health or do more damage. you can also buy upgrades like a rocket launcher in your wrist which is very cool, or a quickhack that sets enemies on fire. it is a typical rpg character progression system, it works well but it's not groundbreaking and the ui needs some work. aside from character progression there is also loot which is handled very poorly. the game drowns you in weapons and clothing but most of it is useless. throughout the game i have encountered about 6 guns that i actually use, these are iconic guns that can be upgraded. despite this, almost every mission will end with my inventory being stuffed with a dozen new weaker assault rifles and pistols. the constant routine of running back and forth to a vendor is exhausting and the kind of thing we all had enough of in skyrim, almost a decade ago. similarly, you will frequently discover an entire new wardrobe. there are lots of cool clothing items in cyberpunk but each of them has an arbitrary armour number so you will spend the majority of the game wearing a stupid mismatched outfit to maximise your armour. the gameplay itself is very basic fpsrpg action. bullet sponge enemies are frequent and your options are usually just stealth or kill everything. i enjoyed it, but the ai is simple and quickhacks are never as impactful as geralt's signs were. if you like the genre of cyberpunk and have a system that can run it, you will love this game. if you are looking for the new benchmark for openworlds you will be sorely dissappointed. i can't wait to see what cd projekt red improves over the next year but as is, the openworld element of this game has glaring flaws that we have seen in dozens of lower budget games before it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"it is not only the bugs which are a lot it is the world, it is boring, npc are repetitive and like zombies, no ai at all, driving is a joke, the physics when you crash are horrible, the drivers npc don't maneuver... the bosses omg, you can shoot them from the door and they stay in the room they don't follow you... it is a big disappointment this game..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i usually stick to multiplayer shooters like eft, insurgency and pubg, and went into the game expecting nothing. i did not preorder it and tried to limit my expectations to the minimum as much as i could, especially due to the fact that a game with so many years of development with no constant audience feedback alphas and betas is bound to have a few issues. also, i run a gtx 1080 with an intel i98th gen and granted, in some densely populated areas my frames drop to 50 in medium settings. with that being said, this game got to me in the first 10 hours. honestly having excited and craving for more. after that, it became superficial, superfluous, with no real skin in the game. decisions became mundane with no real impact on the game and defeating enemies was all too easy even in the hardest difficulty. i felt like a tourist on nc, admiring it, but never a part of it. pros music  never had such an amazing audiophile experience like this. truly immersive and a masterpiece in all regards especially on critical missions gunplay  sometimes a little arcady for my hardcore taste, but when mixed with the melee and hacking and stealth and cover system it ends up being a really fun and exciting combination  story  really dark and engaging, pretty short from the w3, but still good. cons  driving  i've never been a fan of driving games and for me this is tedious and just a means to an end when i want to get quickly to my next quest. the driving system is also quite meh ambition  i mention this as a con because of the high number of angry people that cannot play this game properly even above 30fps due to the sheer size of the world, which is backfiring on them. sadly, if you do not have a powerful gaming rig, you will not be able to enjoy this game for now  weapon modifications  being an avid hardcore shooting gamer, i am used to be able to modify weapons extensively. here you have max 2 attachments per gun after 12 hours of playing, very poor for an fps game it is not a perfect game and it does have a few funny bugs here and there. sure it needs polishing and optimization, but if you are able to tolerate that i have average framerates of 80 in low populated areas this is a fun game, which sadly reeks of mediocrity considering the time they spent on it. honestly, the game has little innovation to offer when compared to similar titles. it is a shame that cdpr was not more transparent for our fellow console players and should receive the fallout for it. keanu reaves was a good addition, but far from being a key piece in delivering a game that feels like a 2015 fps."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i enjoyed the game, but it shouldn't have been released like that. i understand that some people wanted to play it fast, but it wasn't worth it. now that i see the negativity from sony and their fans, i realize that we live in a world of big corporations. that's what this game is about. it opened our eyes to reality. it's tried to be crushed because it contains the truth about what's going on in the world. it's a deep, philosophical, honest game with incredible detail. there's nothing like it today. to me, it's the benchmark game. bugs are everywhere, and here they're even fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,absolutely loving the game. around 30 hours in and love the world and activities. i've been playing on the series x and have ran into very few bugs. can't wait to see what they have in store for the future.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game is amazing  if you have the hardware to run it properly. sure, there are bugs in it but the game as a whole makes it worth ploughing through them. a flawed master piece that i am thoroughly enjoying. if you have the power for it, don't hesitate buying it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,the most complete and a ambitious rpg open world game i ever played. everything is well thought. even the romance is extremely immersive
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"better than the witcher 3 in every way, at least on pc. the combat is actually enjoyable this time around, the game doesnt have micro stutters when walking from garbage framepacing, the story is well written and unique, the setting is one of a kind, and the visuals are easily the best every created again, all this only on pc. i played on an rtx 3090 and got a rock solid 60 fps ultra settings, raytracing on and at ultra as well at 1440p. it shouldve been obvious to people when the trailers were running at 1080p 30fps on an rtx 2080 ti that the downgrade was going to be enormous if you didnt have high end hardware. welcome to the next crysis boys, may console players fill us many cups of salty tears, and your savings for an upgrade be bountiful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"story with touching moments  beautiful graphics with lots of details  extensive rpg system implants, character development  charismatic characters  interesting side missions with their own storyline  bugs, which, however, do not make it difficult to empathize with the game such as flying objects or interface elements remaining on the screen that should disappear  short main storyline i was playing on a laptop with an i79750h and gtx1660ti, 16gb ram. graphics settings high  medium. the game ran smoothly without stuttering."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,to call this roleplaying is misleading. there are no relevant choices for the character to label it as rpg imho. it is an ok action shooter.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the game has way too many bugs and it keeps crashing even on pc. some bugs you encounter don't even let you finish some missions !!! i was waiting for this game since they first announced it, i think 2012 or 2013... it was also the first game i ever preordered. never again ! cd projekt red abused our trust and didn't deliver on many of their promises. also, the game is way too short and that's maybe the biggest disappointment of all. 98 of your game decisions have no consequences at all. i could go on for hours with all the false promises and the let downs. this is a bad rpg and a bad game overall. do not buy it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,realmente aun no lo creo este juego no debio salir eso solo son bugs por todo lado
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,the story is boring the ai is so dumb that they just stand if a car is parked in front on them. shooting water does nothing so you can expect the damn low details. i play on 2060 with ray tracing and there are many games that look better. absolute rubbish for 60
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"sorry for the console players, but it's just running great on my pc and makes a lot of fun. sure there are still bugs, but which game in the last 5 years didn't have day one patches etc. definitely love it! great setting, cool characters, has long playability, high replayability and will get even cooler with free dlcs in the future. have to say, i didn't jump on the hype train, ignored all news about that game before so i can discover and enjoy it unbiased. for that, it's really a great game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"let me start by saying this game is around 610 on gameplay, 710 on story, side missions and gigs, 1010 on graphics, 210 on open world, out of missions immersion, environment interaction and customization, 010 ai systems. the game is solid if you like looking at hd wallpapers and if you enjoy a good linear storyline with plenty of missions to do. however i score the game at overall 510 because the game was announced as something more, as a huge open world immersive game, instead we got half of the product and also with giant ammount of bugs, that no matter what specs you have they might happen, flying cars, stuck weapons, missions that bug out, etc, etc, you can check youtube the multiple bugs this game have. you can even shoot a trashbin with a shotgun and it just stays in place, i mean that is fine for a game but not what this game was supposed to bring in terms of enviroment interaction. you can play and enjoy the game as it is, for its story and missions, just dont expect character customization, open world and game immersion outside of that. moreover, even the story is missing the interactivity, your choices don't really have much of an impact, lifepaths are forgetable, i mean they are nice gimmick only, actually if the game didnt have lifepaths it would feel almost exactly the same thing, and the story will also play almost the same. again, you will have fun if you want a linear story where your choices don't matter much, like the witcher 3. my main grip with it is that in the witcher 3 we were following the path of geralt, while on this game we were supposed to get to create our own story and follow multiple available paths. the factors, such as linear story and lack of open world make this game replayability very low and very much bellow what the game was promised to be. overall, i recomment this game if you want to play a linear story in a beautiful world but even then i would wait for a discount as the game is not worth full price, with bonus that waiting might lead to the game having further patches and dlc that might improve it. if you want a game where you make your own story or open world immersion just stay away for this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"ever since the witcher 3 i have been eagerly anticipating this game. cd project red did not disappoint! for me this is definitely the best game i have played in years. it is the deus ex open world game i dreamed of, but with the added bonus of a tiered loot system. as expected from cdpr, the story is amazing, as is the world building i love learning about the lore of this universe. you do need a decent gaming rig to run this though, but if you have that it is beautiful. now, like was the case for the witcher 3, there are still bugs after release that can sometimes take you out of the immersion, which is a shame, but i have confidence that they will be patched by cdpr. they are similar to the shenanigans you have in the typical bethesda game, but while fans have to make unofficial patches to fix bethesda games, i do not think this will be needed here. if you love the cyber genre, and you love being immersed in world with rich lore and a good rpg system, buy this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"of course, its not 10 points, but id like to support developers. cyberpunk is a very good game despite of bugs. majority were just ditched by their expectations."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this game has so many problems that i don't know where to start, the rpg elements are basic, there are no sporadic or emergent secondary missions, but rather they are presented as a list of errands, the script is linear, the mechanics are felt from 10 years ago and are not polished, and if we add the terrible performance with a lot of bugs, this game ... cd projekt you should pay us to play it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,this game is very good. one of the best rpg. graphics on xbox series x is very nice. this game is so fire!!!!!!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"enjoyed the game, despite the amount of bugs. naturally i didn't have any high expectations, like many here, so the game more than met them. and i'm sure it will be polished all the way through. today's players are too spoiled, although you can understand them, looking at all the discussions around the game. however, this is no excuse for such a senseless reaction. the game is still full of interesting moments, the gameplay can be fun. the story is interesting to follow."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i can't understand the negative attitude against cyberpunk 2077 i play the pc version. that there are many bugs on consoles may be, but the developers promise improvement and deliver patches and apologized to the community for it. the game itself is an absolute blast if you look at it as a complete game package. for me, it's one of the most brilliant games of the last few years. it's a shame that something so great can be knocked down so quickly nowadays."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"love this game so much, bugs are just a little barrier but the rest of it is just great"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i've played 60h of cyberpunk 2077, finished main story line and all major side quest. let me tell you  this game is grand. yes, i know that there is that controversy related to bugs but i can assure you, on pc the game is solid. from y experience, this whole thing is highly exaggerated. during my 60h playthrough the game haven't crashed even once. and only two times i had to reload the save because some mission objective would not update. just two times during 60h! people who call it a buggy mess clearly just want to cash in on youtube views or article clicks. listen to your fellow gamer, you can play it without the doubts. you will enjoy it. the most common bugs that i noticed are graphical ones. sometimes npcs are tposing far away, at the edge od field of view. sometimes, also at the edge of field of view, cars jump up in the air. you can also encounter some npcs clipping into the road or a wall. nothing really major. to be honest i think i would not even notice those bugs if i wouldnt be focused on looking for them. those minor bugs are the reason i'm giving this game 910. i can imagine someone might be more irritated with them and score the game at 810. but the truth is, everything below that is just straight up unfair. now for the good parts night city  it's the most realistic city you will find in a video game. the scale, the ammount of people, there's something happening on every street. sure, im most cases those are just very similiar activities, but those make sure you have a feeling the city lives. you cant just go from point a to b, something will happen while you do that. the whole city design. it had to be titanic work bringing this thing to be. for me the city is another character in this game. it will chew you out and spit you out. it's a city of dreams but those dreams usually end bad for the citizens. characters  expect nothing less than in witcher 3. when you finish the game, you will feel that feeling of emptines and nostalgia. the same that you have after finishing good book. victor, misty, panam, judy, kerry, evelyn, rogue, river, us cracks, johnny and so on. you will make friends, you will care about them. they are not perfect, they are not there just to bring you the joy and not for everyone of them there will be happy ending. but that's what make them feel real. story and side quests  there's a lot of simple quests, called gigs that are more or less just a generic quests go there, steal this, kill someone, hack something. but there are also some of the most mature quest you will ever experience in a video game. they will ask you questions what it means to be alive? is your personality and body the only thing that makes you? can you live without the soul? is ai truly alive? what does it mean to be free? is it worth to chase your dreams? gun fight is great, especialy in a late game once you unlock certains skills, get proper implants. hacking is awesome. i even liked the melee. you just need to get gorilla arms to have fun out of it. there are some other aspects of this game that i could write essey about but i'm not very good at it, so i won't. just know that this game is a lot of fun. just like the witcher 3. it's different in many aspects but at a core it's the same. a game created with love. and because of that it's sad that both media and youtubers jumped on that controversy band wagon, trying to make a quick cash. this game does not deserve that. you can play it right now and you will have a great time. you will get emotional, sometimes sad, sometimes happy but you will have that feeling that you are experiencing a great adventure. and i hope that after cdpr fixes those bugs that i mentioned, and both media and youtuber won't have any more issues to exaggerate, the game will be recognized as one of the best game world ever created."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,it's the best game i've ever played. main storyline and side questes are on another level. shooting is really good. word is amazing.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"disgusting review bombing from console owners. there is no way pc version of cyberpunk 2077 is a 7 even with all the bugs. the music is fantastic and all custom made  talk about effort, the voice acting is superb, story is great, visually night city is stunning and probably the most impressive videogame city ever made. the main problem for pc version of cyberpunk 2077 is bugs, which will be fixed with time. witcher 3 launched in a pretty bad shape too, but was eventually polished. sure, ai definitely could use some work. and they could make city feel more alive by adding tattoo shops, hair stylists, maybe some minigames, etc. but that's all fixable and at least some of those things are surely coming with the promised dlcs next year. i have a midrange pc gtx 1060 and i could run the game smoothly with high settings so there are clearly people here that exaggerate how unoptimized this game is. i played for 60 hours and thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. objectively i'd rate it 810 right now before bug fixes and dlc additions, but seeing all the disgusting review bombing i have to give it 1010. when it's all said and done cyberpunk 2077 will be remembered as one of the best rpgs ever made. give it time, you'll see."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the masterpiece! 1010 i play on ps4pro yes, this game has some bugs, but it doesn't disturbe for playnig. i am sure  cdpr will provide some necessary pathches to fix them. they already did the same with the witcher 3 cdpr  the best game developer ever!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i wanted to rate 78 because of bugs, but when i see that some overminds rate 05 i haven't another choice. this is not a wooden console version, pc mates haven't those critical problems, but if you have some on pc, update it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"is a masterpiece in two month without bugs, this game will be on of the best ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"so, over hyped cyberpunk. i had unrealistic expectations, lot of my friends too. then i have stared playing half an hour after release. and first five hours of game was terrible. dont catch me wrong, im pc player and with 3080 had only two bugs wich needed restart from checkpoint. its ok for released game. but the story. not catchy, i had no feelings about vs decisions or paths. but it is better and better with time. after almost twenty hours, im realy interested about next stories from nc. terrible ai, police. empty but shiny city. 7 points 1 for keanu and his voice."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i will start by stating that critical thinking has died on this website, mostly, because all of these 'reviews' are unreasonable and pure vomit. people are complaining about console performance on the pc portal, shows just how 'critical' are these 'wanna be' reviewers. i will try to appeal to a reasonable reader that does not see everything in black and white or either 10 and 0 scores. graphics and hardware optimisation this is a pc only discussion, therefore console buyers should skip this part. i understand the frustration of the players that have a gtx 10 series or older gpu, not being able to run the game smoothly and at high settings, however the rtx users have a great time, mostly because of dlss. even an rtx 2060 with dlss on can run you high to ultra settings at 5060 fps. is that unreasonable for a gpu that costed 349 msrp at launch? the old hardware struggles, and rightly so. the raw performance, architecture, vram, everything has changed so do not expect to run this game with your 'hard earned' gtx 1060. consoles your ps4 was launched in 2013, you should have a brain of an amoeba to think that you could run the game on a 400 console from 2013, despite the promises. my advice to you be sceptical of everything in your life. back to pc. people saying that cdpr are untalented are absolutely blind. the lighting is so well designed, that in most cases you do not need rtx on for it to be realistic. textures have lots of details. a variety of settings to tailor the graphics to your hardware. the only complaint really is the skin and character animations. they are not as realistic as tlou 2 for example, however more than acceptable to enjoy the game. i guarantee that reviewers that complain about low fps, poor graphics etc. run a non rtx gpu. if they do and still have issues, then they have issues not with the game. don't believe me and this review, go and check the youtube, and i'd highly recommend the 30 min linustechtips video. another advice if you have old hardware play on geforce now or stadia. gameplay i would like to see at least one critical negative review of the gameplay and rpg aspect. i laughed so hard at 'spencieboi' opinion that rpg system is either boring or nonexistent. he clearly did not open the menu to see that there are 5 main attributes, 23 categories for each attribute, and about 20 perks for each category. do the maths. there is a lot of freedom of choice. you choose the clothing and fighting style, weapons, stealth or berserk, cyber implants etc. is that not enough rpg? even the witcher 3, people's most favourite, has less rpg elements. the dialogues are well written, and only a child will not be able to follow a conversation, even if they use seemingly futuristic language. the choices you make do not necessarily change the outcome, but the means you get to it. i am not going to spoil anything so you will have to see it for yourself. even though there is a lot of freedom in this game, it does not reward the player for killing random npcs, and the ncpd are going to issue a warrant to kill you, as well as other netrunners coming for you. the weapons feel real, maybe cdpr got inspired by cs go and its physics. is it a looter shooter? perhaps. is the looting essential like destiny or borderlands franchise? no. you may have weak weapons, the attribute level and perks are going to boost you, and viceversa. an issue here is the balance of the perks. obviously it is hard to balance out the value of different perks, therefore only the future patches are going to indicate whether some skills are op or not. this game is not just a shooter, or a slasher, or a stealth crawler, it is a combination and you decide how you want to play it. isn't it what rpg means? or do people desire for god of war and the witcher 3 rpg where the changes in gameplay are minimal and don't require the player to use his brain. bugs the bugs are certainly present. the question is, whether you are lucky enough to find a few cosmetical bugs e.g. npcs walking over cars, being stuck in textures, weapons being invisible etc. i have not experience gamebreaking bugs, crushes, stuck quests etc. maybe i was lucky enough, or maybe people exaggerate the seriousness of the bugs. i remind you that the review is pc only. console bugs do not concern me and i frankly do not care. conclusion buying a game at launch, you sign the 'early adopter' title, whether the game is buggy or fully functioning and perfect. do not expect the game to be playable on any hardware. do not expect the game to be a 'smash a button to win'. use your brains. read into the skills and perks. let the game lead you into its mechanics, it does it really well. if you cant afford the hardware to render the game on your system, you have cloud gaming option, and you will be shocked how good it has gotten. please readers of metacritic, don't be manipulated by negative or positive reviews, not even by this one. form your own opinion."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this game's ass. riddled with bugs, no new or innovative mechanics. no roleplaying potential. the ai as mentioned by so many people is nonexistent. it's a linear story in a beautiful but otherwise empty world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the entire game is painfully mediocre and full of broken promises. the story is completely linear, the dialogue options are pointless, the classes and builds are nothing more than a bunch of passive buffs, life paths are irrelevant after the first 30 minutes, the open world is lifeless, the npc ai is nonexistent, even the story suffers from some serious pacing issues that seem to point to cut content. the game is a soulless aaa cash grab that ea would be proud of"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"?!  ,   .    .    ...."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"as a pc user i cannot speak for console but this game has its bugs bugs should not define a game, every game has them and they are temporary, and sure you can rush through it like any other game, as people are saying that its a waste of time to use stealth or anything other than brute force and speed. but the thing those people dont understand is how to enjoy an rpg for its world, characters, and gameplay as a whole. this game has had more love put into it than any game i have ever played, sure its not perfect, but every aspect of its design is more enticing than any game i have played. to those on the edge trying to decide whether to take the leap of faith and purchase this game, note this this game was pressured to be released by majority of the users that have given it poor reviews. this game is a work of art which even i would call unfinished, and yet it is the future of rpgs, it is also more than worth your investment and your support. i hope that you will be able to set aside the grievances of the few and work past the bugs to experience once of the most beautifully crafted games to have ever been created. the ending made me cry more than i could've imagined. 60 hours in and counting!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"awesome game, do not listen to bad opinions, they'll fix all the bugs and optimization problems soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"if you're browsing this page you're likely to know already about the buggy mess that is cp2077. so, let's pretend that game runs perfectly, with no bugs, glitches, crashes and so on. is cyberunk a good game? well, no. it's not terrible either, but it's definitely far from what it was advertised as. the city looks nice, but there's nothing to do outside of questlines, so you don't rerally get to live night city. the story is not half bad, but it's totally on tracks. there are a bunch of endings which quality may vary, but other than that, the main questline doesn't change in the slightest depending on what you have chosen previously. the game lacks some features that were standardized in much, much older games. not only you don't get to change your body, you don't even get to cut your hair. you don't get to customize your cars, not even on the inside. if i have to be honest, i've come to realize that the game was flawed when while exploring night city, i took my time to explore a cool looking club, and i couldn't even order from the barman. and now, we can step back into reality, and remember that the whole game is again a buggy mess. there was not a single moment that i was enjoying that wasn't ruined by a bug of some sort. it actually became quite funny to witness all the janky physics and the disappearing stuff throughout the game. without the obvious technical issues, cp would be barely passable, but definitely far from the standard that i would have expected from cdpr. not only cyberpunk is far from being a game changer in the gdr universe, it doesn't even get right things that we saw in games from more than a decade ago."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"great game, i have been waiting a long time, no bugs, while a lot of people said it would. best game in town!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this game isnt nearly as bad on pc as some people make it out to be. when giving a score to a game i think one should compare it to other games of the same genre that came before, and when comparing cyberpunk 2077 to other actionrpgs its just fine. of course this is almost completely the fault of cdprs marketing division who for years have been presenting the game like it would be the coming of the gaming messiah, so i wont hold it against people for comparing the game to promises made. i find the gameplay enjoyable apart from a few annoyances, and the story of the game is really good. yes its still buggy at the time of me writing this, but those will be fixed soon. hopefully they will add some missing features as well in time, along with more content in dlcs. worth giving it a try for sure. you might want to wait some time for it though. just a reminder, that this review is only about the state of the pc version. the ps 4 and xbox one versions are unplayable trash and cdpr should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it in such a state. may they lose lots of money on that  so they think a second time about doing such  in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,best rpg i have ever played. okey if u have bad pc better think about buying it on pc and maybe buy it at stadia or geforce now.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"would really recommend this game as long as you can over look the small bugs, then get it story is the best iv play in a long time, and its just put together so good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,okay the game is suffering from poor optimization but the game is actually good story open world it is beautiful so if you want to enjoy the game wait until the update that's coming in a few weeks or buy the game and save often the game we'll crush on you
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"great cyberpunk atmosphere. interesting game plot and side quests, detailed characters. a lot of references to cyberpunk books, films and games. i played 40 hours and met only 45 minor bugs v 1.0.4 with only 2 game crashes. and i plan to play at least 100 hours more to explore every square meter of its beautiful nightcity!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,so far love it. about 15 horus of play. one major bug. not a big fan of rpg but cyberpunk 2077 world rocks.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"game is between 8 and 9. let's say 8.5 is fair but i give it 10 as i see many unfair negative feedbacks first, it is pc so being unplayable on ps4 or xbox not related to the rating here second, bugs always exist in games in the early stage so i don't consider it in rating now about the game it is not something new as advertised it a mixture of existing games far cry, gta, and so on but to be honest better than all of them it is poorly optimized which i hope fixed in updates world design is good but well don't expect a witcher game. not all can communicate with the world as i saw in communities but for me, it is well designed the combat system is well designed but now problems in the game 1characters characters are not that much well designed like the witcher game. they simply can be predicted 2 the story is not that much deep or better say still not interested me as well 3 side quests and exploring not that much fun. side quests are just simple tasks and there is no point in exploring at all and if you do not rewarding well there are still rooms for improvement even in gameplay but even at this state this is a fantastic game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,this game is absolute trash and a waste of money. do yourself a favor and dont buy this piece of
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,a stunningly beautiful game with a great story and working shadows. if you like rpgs you will love this.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"firstly, the reviews of 0 up to about 6 are frankly just childish, salty bullst. second my review is based on my experience technically speaking and i should note ive had no technical issues at all, so your mileage may vary. to keep it short the game is amazing, the story is amazing, the characters are amazing, the detail in the story telling is amazing, the voice acting is amazing, graphics are amazing etc im sure you get the idea by now. i have just found the game to be amazing. was is overhyped, you could say that but what game isnt really. that being said ive not been disappointed at all. a lot of the complaints ive seen outside of bugs make me think these people havent actually played the game. i would say its more linear than the witcher 3 but then again, ive played the witcher 3 through about 7 times so i know the little differences which decisions can make, so when i play cyberpunk 2077 again, i may notice more changes. that being said there are decisions which do have an impact where i have saved and loaded to check, anyone who says different is to be blunt, lying. gameplay is good, the skills etc reminds me of system shock 2 in that each opens different options for missions and routes to take. soundtrack is also amazing. the best part of it all for me however is the story, storytelling the characters. its presented amazingly well and the voice acting is just perfect. i was worried about it having a only first person perspective but its done in such a good way i no longer care that it doesnt have third person cutscenes. to sum up if someone tells you the game is bad and not because of the bugs just ignore them, they are full of crap. if someone tells you the game is bad because of the bugs you should listen. edit for info on performance  im running 32gb of ddr4, 9700k and a 1080 and its running 60fps all maxed no problem."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"cdr manages again to create a game where the story or stories adds to the open world setting instead of distracting, this is were cyberpunk 2077 stands out. like in countless other open world games, you have a map dotted by a myriad of icons, each representing some kind activity. however, the way in which all the different plots makes you flow through them makes the difference. as a matter of personal taste big fan of gibson and blade runner, i do particularly enjoy the highly '80s retrofuturistic look and feel and atmosphere. the game isn't glitches and bug free but so far 25 hours into the game that hasn't been too detrimental. on my rtx 2080, i7 7700 pc some compromise in terms of visual settings are necessary, but despite that the game looks glorious."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"i don't know why people are so obsessed with criticism about this game. of course it's buggy and have some problems with gameplay, but this errors doesn't change how amazing and addictive this game is. missing tarot cards or the way how the glass is crushed this is not a problem not to fix in the close future. cyberpunk has a lot of mechanics and a wellwritten characters that make us connected with them. even the simple activities like shower or drinking are kinda involving. my v. is a badass with a broken heart who's trying to survive. i had great time playing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"decent enough game, played it on pc and on my 40 hours of gameplay i had 1 game breaking bug, which fixed itself with a reload. requires some more optimization but it ran on my gtx 1050ti well enough to be played through. like the story and narrative a lot but the choices you have very limited weight 80 of the time, there are some really meaningful choices but they are few and far between. the shooter gameplay is quite good, i've seen some people compare the game to the gta series, but to be honest i like the gameplay of this game better. the rpg aspect is good but not great, you have many ways of customising your character but i find the perk system a bit bare, the cyberware customisations are amazing though so tit for tat. the crafting system is quite good in my opinion, simple but effective, gear drops are also quite good, you'll be getting upgrades constantly and if you find a piece of gear you enjoy you can upgrade it to keep using it, though i would advice checking the upgrade costs because they actually get quite steep after a few upgrades. now to address the elephant in the room it does not reach up to the hype that was built around it, but let's be honest nothing could. what happened for this game has happened a thousand times and i'm sure it will happen again, people get hyped out of their minds and then when the product inevitably fails to meet those expectations they don't like it, which is fair, i just don't think it's very productive for the games industry as a whole. in general i don't regret my purchase i got 40 hours of gameplay which for the price is very good value, once cdpr has polished the game more which i'm 100 sure they will, i'll have another go at it at max difficulty to 100 it and see the game as it was supposed to be done."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,not the game that was promised but still a game i very much enjoyed playing. i seem to have got lucky with bugs as i barely experience any and all were minor.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"the beauty of the witcher's story telling is back at its finest. first person camera allows us to experience it in even more immersive way. male v's voice acting is just amazing. characters are very interesting and we get to know their history. night city looks incredible with many advertisements' neons, street noise and variety of pedestrians. shooting is fine but music makes it so much better that it is taken to a whole new level. however, you just can't avoid seeing bugs in your gameplay. game still needs much work on tech and optimization. ai is on a low lvl. in the city, i felt lack of barber shops or tatoo saloons. this makes your v's appearance unchangable for a whole gameplay. except clothes and cyberware ofc. crafting is totally useless, but it is still a gameplay expansion. for the summary, i love this game  the story, the soundtrack, the dialogs, the characters, the world. this is an amazing game and it has not deserved the hate is gets. 95100"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,i guess it strongly depends on what you expect this game offers you is a great world where i had fun spending hours just driving arround or let myself float throug crowded places where i found one post card view hunting the next. exploring and finding tons of little stuff. a great main story great and fresh side quests also great world events. as an example just to give you something to do there are gangs and stuff in the world to kill. once i had a npc which just got maniac and when i was looking arround i found his laptop where i could find emails. he was a ex soldier in the previously war and got wounded next his insurance rejecting his payment for his for psychotropic drugs and other mails of him seeking for help befor he obviously got maniac. all of that for literally a single npc enemy! and it wasn't even a side quest. some people claim that you life choices have no impact on the game... but trust me it is not the case even while the impact is diffrent then you might expect. you do not get a diffrent start but you get diffrent choices leading to diffrent outcomes. but i guess the most important aspect is that you wont get another generic open world sandbox but a story driven rpg. no you can't just blow up cars and see what happens next. this is not what the game is designed for. it was made to present you a wonderful city and an meanigful story with great story telling and superior writing compared to similar games. and unlike some other open world games after 50h i still get called to new types of missions and new stuff to do. where else do i get this? so at the end maybe it is just a matter of you what do you expect and what do you wan't. p.s. i just had one bug forcing me to restart the game in 50 hours. in comparization i have to restart gta 5 like every 3h. also gta5 has loding sequence long enough5m to restart my pc and cyberpunk several times
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"amazing,despite the bugginess which will be fixed it is honestly the best game ive ever played beside fallout 3 fallout new vegas so yeah i def know a game made with love and this is the game all the hate is pointless bc if cdpr released this as early access to preorders ppl literally wouldnt be whining if ur consoles old oh well time to upgrade graphics and open world and the amount of choices plus there is a loot aspect based on rarity similar to borderlands its literally a realistic borderlands in my opinion with dialogue choices vehicles tons of interiors etc must buy!!!!!!!!!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"fallout 76 was better at launch than this mess. glitches and texture bugs make it unplayable. hopefully they can fix it, but because of the enormous hype they would have to pull a no man sky style solution hastily."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"premetto di non aver ancora terminato il gioco sono circa a met, ma trovo doveroso scrivere una recensione per via del fallimento del lancio su console old gen. quando dissi ad un mio amico di aver comprato cyberpunk 2077, lui mi disse perch l'hai fatto? quel gioco  pieno di bug! solo per sentito dire, lui non l'ha provato. io allora gli dissi che ha l'aria di un gioco incredibile, mastodontico e che i bug non inficiano affatto l'esperienza. davvero, questo gioco ha la portata e l'ambizione di red dead redemption 2 e, per molti versi, il suo livello di qualit per quanto siano due modi molto diversi di intendere l'open world. per chi crede che questo gioco sia una specie di grand theft auto coi cyborg, devo dirvi che vi ritroverete tutta un'altra opera davanti. ha decisamente molte pi affinit con far cry e con gli immersive sims deus ex e dishonored in primis, quindi abbraccia idee di gameplay molto complesse, dando l'opportunit di scegliere l'approccio fin nei minimi dettagli volendo, si pu anche non uccidere nessuno per tutta l'avventura. e poi, dai, c' keanu reeves, potreste mai non mettere come voto 10 ad un gioco dove john wick vi segue costantemente?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"lies and lies and lies... most dialogues 98 have no impact on the story whatsoever. they literally cut half the game out under our noses and said nothing pretending like it was fine and straight up lying about many things. some things like apartment customization and car customization was cut before launch. they cut the police system, the mantis wall thingy, ecc ecc.... dont forgot they said the game will be coming when its ready in one of their infamous yellow tweets. bruh, this game is only the shadow of what it was supposed to be. disappointed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"let's address the elephant in the room and that is inexcusable omission of full control customization. yes, this is something that maybe patched later, however it's not just the lack of but also the worst user unfriendliness overall. some keybindings are hardcoded, some do not show up at all in menu and some keys cannot be bound even for the commands which are remappable. i've been playing pc games since the wolfenstein 3d era and this is just the worst case of inaccessibility in pc gaming to date. moreover, many users report that external programs which manage key binding also do not work, effectively barring large number of people from playing the game. currently game is unplayable for  disabled  left handed  right handed people who do not conform to the default coming from a company that developed several pc titles and already faced this issue on at least one o them, this is just inexcusable level of downright incompetence. game set in a world that is all about customization, does not allow you to customize how you play it. the irony could hardly be stronger. and that's my review because, being left handed myself, after about an hour i just gave up and asked for refund."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"dear gamers! if you read this review, please notice, this is my subjective opinion. you can agree and disagree with me, but if you disagree with me, please respond to my review in the manner of a sensible person. first i wanted to talk about my scores graphics1010 storycontent 1010 controlsphysics 910 music 1010 subtitles 1010 technical implementation 710 replayability 1010 user interface 1010 now the review i fully completed the story. i think the hype was rightful, because we've got a very nice looking game with a big city. graphics i really loved it. it has a very nicely designed city with people and cars. storycontent i really loved the story, and the side quests too. the player has a lot of choices in dialogues, a lot of dialogue choices had no consequences, but at least they make the dialogues colourful. controlsphysics the controls were comfortable, but the physics were a little bit unrealistic and buggy. music the music in the game is really make me feel like a true cyberpunk. subtitles it has a lot of language subtitles, not only english, german, spanish, japanese etc. it has czech, hungarian, arabic, polish, turkish, italian subtitles, but these languages were translated by real people, not with google translator. technical implementation now comes the disadvantage of the game there are a lot of bugs, with is very annoying, when you can't complete a mission, because of a bug. the optimisation is felt like i'm playing in gta 4 in pc. i hope they will patch the bugs and making a better optimisation. replayability you can choose from 3 prehistories, and you can choose from a lot of endings. after that, when i completed the story, i started a new with another prehistory. user interface i can easily navigate myself in the settings or ingame. summary i think this game is very close for the game of the next year, if they patch the game and adding multiplayer for the game. my points are around 9,5 which is rounded to 10. i think a lot of people are underrating the game due to bugs, and the horrible xbox one play station 4 ports  i have an xbox one too. i thought, these ports are not going to be good, and i bought the game for pc. this game deserves his appreciation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"this is a failure. i would call this product as one of the cold weapons in the game is called stanislav shishkin someone will understand. how could you screw up in places like this 1. the appearance of cops from nowhere? well, did you make a normal moment in the mission, where doctors arrive by car, or on the way home, the cops land and smash the car into splinters? why couldn't it be used? 2. why do the cops start shooting at you after 30 seconds, even if you don't go over the fence, but just stand there looking around without a weapon? 3. sat down and you can not see, no well, are you serious? is it really serious? in the game for over a lot of money, did you implement the stealth mechanics like this? well, it would be possible to come up with something more interesting? i do not know well the mechanics of invisibility for a couple of three seconds, like a spider, for example through an implant, the legs of a lynx you did give noiselessness 4. skill tree, why make skills that are duplicated by implants? the trajectory of grenades, breaking you with another netrunner, and so on? 5. driving cars, have you driven them yourself? there are exactly 3 takchi with normal controls and 1 motorcycle. why does no one ride motorcycles around the city? they are at the tigers for beauty what would hang out there? 6. quests for carswell, what could not be done a car dealership where you come and look communicate with a consultant, go for a test drive, you could tie a couple of missions and then buy. 7. power mechanics, i have gorilla hands, but i can't open the car door? no, are you serious? to break the doors by force, you made an animation and then could not, well, let me tear the door and throw the driver out of the car, it would somehow explain why i need force when stealing a car, but the animation of the usual opening of the car door is.... well, soso solution. 8. creating items, you are in the witcher and it is better done there at least a blacksmith is needed, here i can disassemble any gun for spare parts. and sitting in a field with collect epic fluff  i'm not saying that the creation of weapons in the game is not necessary at all, only pumping cult. 9. ammo, well, why are there so many of them, i only created one time for the whole game and then after the battle with militekhovskimi mercenaries in the city center, where from a shotgun 80  cartridges ate ate killed one mob. 10. why did you make the adjustment of the genitals up to an intimate haircut if you do not use it anywhere? 11. hairdresser, etc. made the same touch through a look in the mirror, why is it not finished? why can i change my hands and feet and brains, but not my haircut? 12. clothing, why couldn't the mechanics of changing the look be done? why to me on the male persian constantly falls epic women's clothing, you would be accused of promoting nontraditional sexual relations. that it was impossible to make clothes that take any form, let the forms first need to be bought, collected or something else, well, 2077, and you all propagandize in the stone age. 13. why was it not possible to make a weapon designer to collect something truly unique yourself? 14. the hand is a rocket launcher with infinite ammunition, so you need ammunition for the machine gun, but not here? really? 15. a city in which you can go to almost any house, but here you can go to 5  10 of houses at most. 16. why do they call me constantly some pretzels and offer me a job, even without knowing me, well, there is a club afterlife well, we would do some introductory quest, where we will be presented and then let them call, this approach kills all the immersion. just didn't have enough time, she would have spent another year or two in development, a huge reserve in the city for running on the walls, it would be great to see the customization of the car and apartment, the spider robot would be a super partner, but alas, keep your vstanislav shishkin. about bugs sinking into textures and so on, i'm silent, fix it, but alas, without reworking the game, boredom after act 2 will not fix anything, passing act 1 i felt pleasure, then, as after the candy flower period, i began to notice, clubfoot."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-18,"an openworld masterpiece that's its own worst enemy at times, cyberpunk 2077 still ranks as a modernday classic...with more than 40 hours clocked over the last week  walking, driving, shooting, hacking and talking my way around night city  it is my favourite game of the year and the best i've played since 2018's red dead redemption 2."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"alright, after finishing game, i have time, and knowledge to wright something about this one. so, first things first. cyberpunk 2077 isn't the best game in the world, like some many of people imagined it will be. game have lots of small bugs and few problems. now, after 70 hours of playing, i can say that cp77 is very well made, rpg. main story is very good, and also, side quests are massive. with only only one side quest chain, could easyly make a whole game for 6h of playtime like cod or any ea product. so, what about bugs... well, i had only one game braeking bug, it killed one o side job not side mission and thats it. few minor glitchs, nothing more. i played on rx 590, 32 gigs of ram u could have only 16, no diferents, and ryzen 1600x on medium settings 5060fps, and boy... medium looks better then any other game i played on ultra. additional thougt that pc cost me around 800 usd 2 years ago! this is not pcmr class of hardware, its cheap af... pls dont claim u need 2,3,4, or 5k pc to run cyberpunk... there is many ppl that have problem with this game, and... i honetly dont know why. city looks real af, ai maybe isn't best on the world, but still, its okey. remember, this is not shooter, its not call of duty. this is mainly role play game. vehicles are ok, if u hate handling, just adapt, learn how to drive in this game. imho cp77 have superiur car handling then other games, specially if u drive heavy vehicles. u can almost feel the weight. collisions in the other hand are  that is something cdpr shoud fix. overall, cyberpunk is very strong rpg game, with immersive city, best graphic on the market, really well made storyline, awesome side quest chains, and i cant wait for dlc's as i said before, cant even imaging why people hate's this game.. maybe, just maybe, these gamers, just dont like rpg games, or maybe its ps4xbx port... anyway, im glad that they screw up optimalization on consoles, and didn't downgrade the graphic quality yes, im talking about every single ubisoft game since fc3 cdpr, thanks for this awesome adventure, im looking for more from cp77 in the near future. peace  positives graphic  oh my god, thisn game looks unreal main storyline  really well put and made side quests  awesome long journey with dozens hours of story map desing  first game that i really dive into the world and didnt though constantly that this is only a game. music  well made and immersive characters  well made story behind them, and well played. negatives minor bugs  clipping, levitating and that kind of stuff major bugs  one side job was bugged, and also there was at least 2030 times that i was forced to load save. plus glitches in inventory if u are consol peasant, add unplayable ps4 port, or buy decent pc or new console xd"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this is the definition of false advertisement. game is extremely buggy and crashes, only way to run somewhat smoothly is to have a 3k dollars pc. even without the bugs and crashes its still a horrible game, remember how they said life path choices would affect the entire game and dialogue? it only affects the first 20 minutes and once in a while it will a different dialogue choice, thats at. the npcs are from ps2 era, cops will literally spawn behind you because they cant drive, cars only go in straight lines, the enemies are blind and stupid they cant hit you and they cant dodge or have sneaky moves, no car customization, very little clothes personalization and they dont affect anything, theres very little interaction in the open world,  have only 3 floors the list goes on and on. disappointment of 2020"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"if you are poor console player, sell  ps4xbox and buy pc. 8 years old konsole vs game from 2020. if you believe that the game will run on your lowconsole you must have 20iq."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"cyberpunk is sort of ok, i guess, but i wish they had made the witcher 4 instead."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"there are several obvious elements missing being cut. there's no public transportation system implemented in the game i think they introduced it before, but cut it as well. the clan and creed system is simplified. no guncloth customization well at least not appearance. no hairfacebody customization. also, there are tons of funny and annoying bugs. after playing almost 100 hours no life for me, i gotta say everything besides romance and main story are pretty boring and tedious. i tried all the endings with both female and male v, and my favourite is leaving nc with panan and judy. i would like to give a 610, since the characters and majority of the main story line are attractive and interesting also i hope the cdpr could fix the bug fast, implement the missing components, expand much much more story line, and release dlc soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the story is great, side characters are beliveable and attachable, main quest and some side quests are on hollywood level, rpg combat mechanics are varied and satisfying. i play this game on a subpar pc. the graphics are not top notch but other elements makes this game superb. i did not see many bugs, only some glitches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,low fps ruins impression of the game. but the game is really cool and addictive.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,glitch rips the walls down every 20 minutes and npc are going invisible during fights. this game is for real a technical trash. its not even finished.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this game is so buggy on release, many glitch on npc model. and there are so much content being cut because reason. yet the rpg element is so good and story is nice. hope the update will fix most of the issue."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,something teribble. very buggy and don't playable at  biggest disappointment of gaming history.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,the game on the xsx runs quite well reaching already 60 fps due to the hotfix 1.0.4 on quality mode which was previous buggy and now the hotfix which fixed mainly all bugs helped alot. overall playing the game i feel the story i quite well driven. panam is a great addition to the game and relationship life.. the emotional significance in the game is quite high the scenery words and mood of the characters did not feel cold or fake or even robotic.. strangely it felt perfectly coded to look very!! human. i love the human feel of the game unlike the cartoonish grand theft auto franchise. ps4 ass lickers are already giving this lovely game a bad review.. when on the ps5 and xsx it runs to the likes of a rtx 2060 super or above.. quite disappointed in playstation for removing it from the ps store. i hope to god xbox doesn't do that if they do i might as well sell my xbox as cyberpunk is the most true immersive video game unlike the fake and cartoony gta which runs on 30fps and terrible resolution still on nextgen. shame on rockstar for not having a next gen update for that. back to the point the game will not make you bored.. a lovely rpg game where you can make the world you want to live in. quite a fun game to play and an overall 10 rating from me. love to the developers.. sorry the hype ruined the launch but it is what it is.  the ps4 and og xbox mofos who wanna give this game a bad review.  the media for jumping on the bandwagon and putting the cd projeckt red team.. and  the metacritic critics because they're either playing on og xbox or base ps4.. and anyone who hates the game just because they don't have a next gen or a good pc an dis jumping on the bandwagon  on this beautiful masterpiece
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,it is very strange how everyone keeps saying they dont have any problem on pc. here i am on a highend pc and there are bugs in pretty much every mission. controls are terrible. and it is clearly an unfinished product. if i could refund it i would.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"que un juego salga como has salido este es de vergenza. llega ser otra empresa y seguro que es imperdonable y se hubiera hundido... lo corts no quita lo valiente... lo cual por buen juego que es o fuese the witcher 3, no quita que junto al crunch que han sufrido haya salido este bodrio.... historia muy bien y traduccin e interpretacin de 10 pero hay tanto bug y la ia es tan mala que hace queda escinectes del juego"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game has a cool plot and it's stupid to deny, but 1. many bugs 2. dumb ai 3. there is no option to disable soapy antialiasing taa which was deliberately cut 4. poor optimization for multithreaded processors 5. there is no possibility to change the appearance of the character, for example, for ripperrs 6. disgusting handling of some cars 7. there is no keyboard control setting it's just what came to mind first"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"fix the game, add the features you promised. this game lacks so much that was marketed it's basically an on rail story with an open world that completely falls apart"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,the game is a beautiful work of art. i spent 38 hours in the prologue. i would give it a 10 but i do realize console users have not hat the experience i did.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"undisputed masterpiece! game with immersive story and stunning graphics. surely many software houses will take an example and, in the next few years, cyberpunk will be able to define the basis under which an rp game makes no sense to exist! congratulations to the polish studio!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"at this current time, it's a game that was way too overhyped. i'd rather play a more respectable game like bugsnax. just saying, bugsnax, a game designed for 5 yr olds, still makes this game look lackluster. i'd say i'm more amused with all the problems this game has rather than being disappointed with what was produced."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"current state is about a 7 just because of the fps and bugs are bringing it down. but i'm sure it will be one of the best games after some patches. be patient, even though it's been 8 years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is the game i didn't know i missed.. while i do prefer the fantasy genre, this has been a refreshing journey through a huge and immersive cityscape. i found the sci fi elements diverse and entertaining. the game has received a lot of criticism for technical issues, but i have yet to experience it after 26 hours of gameplay."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"gameplay wasnt bad but wasnt perfect or near idk i loved the story and the characters, the endings meh the bugs oh boy but myself im always lucky and dont experience many at all or not game breaking i did have to restart once because of it from last chekpoint overall i enjoyed the game more because of the story however as many ppl said its not that next gen of games we all expected the fps issues idk i updated the nvidia drivers and worked extremely well"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"just a disappointment. graphics are terrible, kicks you off the game frequently, bunch of glitches. looks like a ps2 game tbh lol. would return it if i could. gameplays just bad. they shouldn't have even released it. the original doom has better gameplay than this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game has a bigger problem than its unfinished state at launch. it's a farcryrage type experience that just isn't as good as the latest versions of those games. when the bugs have been ironed out lots of work to do there what you're left with is a mildly entertaining action game with rpglite elements. this is not the new deus ex, if that's what you're expecting."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"if you do not take into account the technical composing game, amazing 1210 poles did a great job but failed to optimize for weak hardware"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"yes this is clearly a raging dumpster fire  what i find truly disturbing is the sheer volume of fake reviews suggesting it's a good game somehow. how many so called honest gaming reviewer sites have been compromised? definitely know who to trust now, so i guess thanks for that cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is a good game, but it is not as good as witcher 3. there are quite a few bugs and glitches but it is not the main problem. the main problem is that this game is too much of an fps rather than an rpg. the lack of third person perspective is disappointing and it did not make the game more immersive. furthermore the inventory system is horrible and it made an already complex system feel overwhelming. the physics in this game is also poor. there is a galore of other problems such as the broken policing system, the bad ai, to little things like there is no option to change your hairstyle during the campaign. all of these problems add up and made cyberpunk 2077 feel like an alpha build game rather than a finished product. i am surprised that this is the result after 8 years of development and numerous delays. but i did enjoy cyberpunk 2077 immensely. i like the worldbuilding, the story, and the characters. the side quests are the best things in this game. when i finished this game i created a second character immediately because i want to play more. however i cannot shake the feeling that cyberpunk 2077 should have been better. there is a very good game buried underneath the host of problems. i rate it 88 out of 100"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"ai worse than gta 3. driving controls worse than a mobile game, buggier than a bethesda game. physics strait out of 2003. 7 years to develop this piece of hot garbage?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i get that people were dissapointed becasue cdpr told us we could do anything in this game, but we can't even drink coffee and sit on a bench. i am having too much feelings playing this game and too much fun. i love our voice in the head. johnny is such uniqe addition to game, his comments during side mission changed my choices. yes! you have choices in game, if you focus on people around you and you gonna be lucky and don't see any bugs you can feel so alone in this big city. this feeling of hollow is constant with you. i felt alone as v is alone. not only main story, but sides stories are great. you really seeing this problem with their world, gliches will be fixed, and i surely will put cyberpunk as one of my favourite game and get back to it maybe when it had some dlc and is fixed completly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"it may be the best game i have ever played in my life. while playing the game, i did not have any problems other than 45 bugs. i never had enough bugs to require me to close and reopen the game. the only thing the game upset me was that it wasn't really an rpg, but this story is for these side missions action and atmosphere i can overlook it i definitely recommend anyone who has the chance to play after the optimization update in february."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"people have been talking so much trash about this game, and half of them have never played it. of course, it has its bugs and glitches but so far nothing game breaking. the story, is amazing, and the graphics are stunning. people seem to forget that the witcher 3 was plagued with glitches and bugs on its release and they updated it and kept working on it and it is now regarded as one of the best games ever made. cd projekt red will do the right thing and fix the bugs and update the game further. they will probably also throw in dlc just like they did on witcher. people need to give this game the credit it deserves, and it your pc cant run it, that is not the developers fault. this is a next gen game for a next gen pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"en pc corre perfectamente, la historia engancha y los grficos son los mejores logrados en lo que va en esta nueva generacin, lo siento por los usuarios de consolas, esperemos que tengan un juego mejor terminado y optimizado para ellos"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"although not an amazing game in my opinion, it was fun for my first play though. doing a combination of story content as well as a decent chunk of the side quests that littered night city, i was able to play for about 57 hours before i decided i wanted the game to be done. personally, i felt the main story was too short very short compared to tw3 and the side quests did very little to keep me engaged enough before i wanted to just know more about v's story. i personally enjoyed the story up until the ending but it fits with the narrative i got the generic ending. as far as the game play goes, it was pretty standard. the skilltree was extremely generic, only giving a few keynote abilities for each tree but it got the job done as far as showing progression. the weapons don't really feel different between rarities and levels. the white gun you use at level 1 will feel like the purple or orange gun you find later. smart and tech weapons are nothing new but did change the gameplay a bit once they were found. exploring night city doesn't really have any magic to it. the exploration is subpar due to the fact that you will only find some text logs and maybe some ammo, healingbuff items and some of the game's iconic weapons. there is very little to it compared to other game's that give exotic items full back stories, sometimes quests and maybe even some memorable moments while obtaining them. the combat isn't terrible but does nothing to change the formula not saying that's a bad thing. the melee is just a combination of lightheavy attacks but has a few perks that can make it feel flashy at times. shooting is pretty standard. you will hip fire or ads and target enemy weakpoints. put enough rounds into them while taking advantage of your perks will see most enemies taken down very quickly on hard and lower, at least i had no issue with the combat, personally but the skilltrees are extremely light and don't do much to really make you feel unique outside of a few key ones. the rpg aspect feels almost non existent. there's very little choice in the game and if you are looking for massive story changing aspects, there's just too little of it. most of your playthough will be the same except for the endings and what build you decide on. the endings are mostly based on what quests you complete and a few rare pieces of dialogue here and there. you do level up just like any normal rpg while also gaining perk points for mastering weaponsstealth etc. i will explain further about the 1080ti issues at the bottom the performance is not too bad on pc if you understand your hardware limitations but the 1080ti had weird issues that i can't explain even while using up to date drivers and no temp issues. i was running the game on a gigabyte 1080ti however, i did have to use a mod made by yamashi in order to get the following performance, ryzen 5 3600, 16gb ddr4 3000mhz with the game installed on a samsung evo 860 500gb. playing at 1080p standard, 1080p ultra wide and standard 1440p netted me a solid 5060 fps on high with film grain and motion blur being the only settings disabled. attempting 1440p ultrawide left me at a stable 30fps but i did not wish to play it at that resolution for obvious reasons. i also tried playing it on my laptop which ran a 2070 max q, i7 8050h, 16gb ddr4 2666mhz and also using an ssd. it was able to run ultra at 1080p between 5162 fps but bumping it to 1440p on high left me at 4853 fps. i was not able to attempt ultra wide as the laptop just struggled too much. the story was okay for me. i enjoyed what little of it there was but felt like it was just way too short. i know that cdpr said they were going to reduce the length due to people not beating tw3 but this felt insanely short. i know that the games can't really be compared as one is a third person action rpg while cp2077 is an fps rpg but the side quests are a big issue in my opinion. tw3 had little stories with a lot of its quests where as cp2077's side content felt tacked on. there's little dialogue, no substance, and it is mainly there to give you exp and loot. you won't find out more about the world other than, this gang member is bad, stop them, or, this person needs to be rescued, go save them and i'll give you good stuff. i personally felt like this was the biggest disappointment about the game for me. overall, cyberpunk 2077 is a good game but did not live up to expectations. i didn't really follow the hype as much as others but i was still looking forward to this game. i enjoy the setting, loved the tabletop game and have enjoyed all of the witcher games as well as other rpgs, and cp2077 has felt like the weakest game i have played this year. what little there was, i enjoyed but cdpr needs to improve the game further with more content, hopefully good dlcs later and regain that magic they apparently lost during this game's development"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"horrible game. cdpr hyped this game up so much all by themselves. one would have at least expected it to be on par with other rpg titles in recent years like fallout 4 or skyrim for example regardless of the fact that these are several years old. then when cdpr stealthily changed the genre of cyberpunk from rpg to openworld actionadventure, one would've thought it might be on par with other openworld, actionadventure games like far cry, gta, watch dogs, etc. well i can tell you it is none of these things. it is a worse rpg than fallout 4 and it's a much worse openworld game than either far cry or watch dogs. it fails in every category. even the storytelling is horrible since it's clear they cut so much content at the beginning of the game when the origin paths are just 15minute sequences all followed by the same cookiecutter montage that is supposed to replace several weeks of actual exposition. the combat is subpar, the ai is  laughable, there is literally no driving ai the cars are on rails, there is extremely limited player choice, whatever rpg systems are there are not good such as looting and clothing, the player progression system is poorly balanced, and worst of all, the world is extremely shallow and, in my opinion, not immersive whatsoever. npcs share many of the same exact animations and lines and don't have much variation in how they react to you as a threat or otherwise, police spawn behind you when you commit a crime regardless of where you're standing, the list goes on and on. and yet, you'll still see people defending this game and saying things like it's just not for you.  that. cdpr misrepresented the absolute living  out of this game and somehow the general gaming population either doesn't know or doesn't care. they got away with murder on this one. all i can say is that gaming is in a sad state of affairs because it's dominated by the average gamer, and the average gamer is not very discerning."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"if you look for gta on cp2077, you might be disappointed. but if you look for witcher3, you might be certainly satisfied."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"to offset a lot of reviewers giving pretty unfair, and idiotic 0's to this game, i'll throw a justasstupid 10 up. so there. i'd actually currently give this game a solid 7 right now, yes, bugs and all. but i honestly could give my personal 10 now, for the future where they've smoothed over the numerous bugs, which, by the way, have still not been enough to keep me from playing, but i do know, and depend on the mod community whatever cd projekt's fix timeline is and they've already fixed many of the tome, seemingly nit picky to miss the gravity of what this game is now, and will be in time. do i reccomend this game? as a fan of the genre since 1994, cyberpunk more than earns the name, and i've spent apparently 100 hours in, and by my guess halfway through the game, but i honestly have no clue where 'shortage of content' or 'lifeless' comes from when i read reviews. did side mission character rolls go horribly wrong? not going to pretend this game has the best character performances across the board, but i found the way that this game hides very important choices amidst inconsequential ones deceptively clever and offers you choices that do feel widearangeof responses, that even if railroaded, the game does feel very up to you. and that, though i have not hit credits, i know leads to permutations on ending at least 5 different ways. this has me really investing in my character in situations i seek out. that may be one of the biggest problems people have with this game. the world does not actively come at you in this game. there are no arcade side gimmick minigames or meaningful traffic ai or roamiing questgivers etc, but it does have a living city the way it promised it would, but only when you look at the map do you realize just how much stuff there is to do in this game. i argue the side missions are the strength they give your character the opportunity to build a longer, or shorter story out of the stakes that you've set for yourself, or not yet, and the main scenario is more or less something to get back to eventually. it took me 20 hours to hit the title screen, and it has been one of the coolest experiences with games by itself, as a vertical slice of the time i am having after it, and what i expect will result in future dlc, a sequel, and a hell of a lot of mods. i think this is going to be damaging to cd projekt red until they can get most people to my experience with quality. that's going to take some time. there are people who are having my experience, and i think it  that the ratings reflect this. the middle ground reviews i honestly trust the most and find the the fairest judgement on this game's strengths, weaknesses, and abundancy for bugs which, when you filter that through like my review in time, the 57's now will over time become 8's and 10's. this is a monumental, mishandled launch for a monumental, and honestly awesome video game that just wasn't cooked enough but in this age, as we've seen, throw it back in the oven, or over to the modding chefs in this metaphor, and you come out the other side with happier people. not saying it is acceptable to launch games this way but if we're going to, at least i can see down the line to when people get over it for this title this game at it's best is what i was hoping for."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"there's definitely problems with this game. the open world and npc behavior is rough. law enforcement npcs can't be working as intended. the driving can be rough at points. combat is moderately substandard. visuals when not being pulled out by glitches, the storytelling, and the rpg sections are enough for me to look past the launch issues. it's a gem. just not a polished it cut one ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"for all of the technical misgivings on release , it's still a great game, probably one of my favourite ones already. the story is well written, unfolding both on the main plot line, and in the side lines, the characters memorable and surprisingly likeable. it's not gta, and it's not supposed to be, although the drivers ai does need some changes. as for the live paths issue  this sounds mostly like it's coming from people who never played this type of rpg before, and looks like a case of mismatched expectations with what can actually be done within reason, and within a pretty linear rpg game. all in all, i do expect to see the game rise up and flourish in the next few weeks."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"beautifully boring is the best way to describe it. the world is just not interesting and despite the detail and effort put into it, feels hollow. enemies are all the same, combat is a joke even on the hardest difficulty, and the characters just dont pull you in. they did do a good job with the main quest line so props there, its what i expect from the guys who made witcher, but they really need to learn how to make more engaging side quests and gameplay. witcher suffered from similar problem, it just got boring towards the end because ai is not interesting or challenging. but the world of witcher was just more interesting to me. maybe its because its so foreign. cyberpunk pretty much looks like a normal urban city. sure there are some tech upgrades to people and objects but otherwise, it looks very much like real life. which i find, boring i guess. i also feel like the rpg elements of character building are thrown in without thought and have little to no impact. you literally can avoid them near entirely and it wont stop you from trivializing the game with just found gear. gear is also a mess. stuff you find gets outclassed really fast and nothing is really special, not even the so called iconic items. crafting is too simple to be interesting too and the economy.... what economy? money falls off trees. its only a small issue early in the game and then money is worthless. one note. i didnt have any major technical issues with the game on the pc. it fired up fine on high on my gts 980 which is very old. i did edit the config file to allow for more ram. there are bugs in the game, like npc impersistence and cars clipping into the ground just saw it once and walking through a wall. but nothing game breaking. all in all, it was an average game for me but i can see why some might like it. i wasnt a fan of gta either so i suppose its fair to say these games are just not my cut of tea."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"despite being a mess in some ways bug wise i've still enjoyed my 80 hours of cyberpunk so far. this is on xbox series x which is probably the best place to currently play on console, but still needs a lot of polish."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"it is a visually stunning and entertaining story. you will feel for the characters just as in a great movie. on the other side cyberpunk 2077 should of never been released for old consoles, the hardware is just inadequate to support game like cyberpunk 2077. i am playing it through rtx 2080 on high  ultra settings, looks amazing  haven't finished it yet but so far, it's been worth the wait. encountered 3 bugs so far which are minor fell through a floor in one spot when got hit by an uppercut p, after upgrading a rare samurai jacket to an epic one, it's supposed to consume the rare one but it did not so now i have 2 lol. i find the side quests, very funny at times, others bring down on you reality of the night city, some you really wish did not end. story, quest, character writing is best since witcher series. you actually want  i know it's hard to believe to pursue the side quests, you will be greatly surprised by the variety of topics. you will love the side quests! all in all pc version is awesome but as i said above, it should have never been released on old gen consoles. it's like trying to carve a granite bust with a bone chisel."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,the game was promising but it has been simply realised very poorly. we can forgive the huge quantities of bugs but not the poor ia or should we say absent? and the very poor quality mechanics of the city all around.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"a perfect example of bait and switch. this is nothing like they advertised. this should have been called cyberquest because you'll just be going on quests. everything else is just unfinished and full of bugs. people try to cut them slack like they focused on next gen but that's not the case, next gen wasn't even around when they were developing this for years. it just shows how buzzwords like ray tracing can make you insanely rich. this is really a game for people that just want to brag that it ran on their system on the highest setting."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game is great, spending the weekend on it was a great decision. at the moment, more polishing is needed, i want a more lively environment, more realistic reactions of passersby, as in the witcher. the game is full of pleasant little things, and the world seems alive and it lacks quite a bit. optimization at a good level i3 6100 in conjunction with gtx 960 stretched the game at 40 frames with medium settings. i am satisfied. planned to upgrade the hardware to enjoy ultra settings. i advise everyone. if we talk about the plot, i find it exciting and interesting. i remember how i really shed a tear when geralt found circuses in a house on the island of fogs, and then, when our partner jackie was dying, i really felt the loss, because he had already become close to me during the prologue. i can also advise you not to neglect the exploration of the world. postpone plot tasks and complete as many secondary ones as possible. even banal orders from fixers have funny and interesting moments. i also want to give parting words to the developers, since not everything is so good and tolerant. the behavior of passersby and traffic flow leaves much to be desired. as a couple you notice that people are standing on the green and this is not good. even in gtasanandreas, it was a little better in this regard. i also want to warn you that for correct operation you need to thoroughly update all drivers because there are compatibility problems and i personally had to reinstall the game 3 times for everything to work correctly. as a result, i think the game is the best thing that happened in 2020, but i dont consider the shortcomings critical, all this can be corrected and brought to the ideal in a couple of months and the game pushes to go through itself many times it will be interesting !!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"base ps4 player here, yes theres bugs! im use to that because i have played games such as skyrim. i have not had any bugs that has caused me not to finish a quest or anything. the visual i dont think are as bad as people make it sound... i mean i cant expect pc graphics on a almost 10 year old console. as for frames.. it does drop bad in fights and textures do take a bit to load which is annoying. hopefully it will be patched. but honestly this is one of the better rpgs i played in a long while, the story is amazing the dialogue i like how everything is voiced the side gigs and well the loot im actually quite addicted to this game. i think its absolutely fun! i can see this game being amazing with a few patches and probably can go down in history with the modding community on pc. this game really brings that blade runnerfifth element kind of feel, the world is gross and full of adds how i imagined a cyber world would be. i think if it had a much smoother launch this game would definitely be one of the best out there!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i understand this game is getting a lot of negative attention from players experiencing 'nearconstant crashes, bugs, glitches' and the like, with many of these sources playing on highend pc's and ps5's. i've been playing for about a week on my basicb ps4 and while i acknowledge my experience is not always going to be universal, this game has been absolutely breathtaking. far from the reports of the console version being 'unplayable', my time in night city has been almost completely without bugs of any kind. the game will crash out on average once a day, and that's with about 6 hrs of play far from constant, and since i'm in the habit of quicksaving often it's no sweat off my back. also worth noting my internet is very average. so yes anecdotally i'd say the reports of an unplayable game are unfounded and exaggerated. as for the gameplay etc? love it. i'm usually bad at firstperson shooters, but i've found the combat fun and innovative and varied i like my sniper  quickhacks  stealth personally, but am not above laying waste to thugs with brute force. the character creation is quite indepth and the clothes you pick up along the way keep you feeling fresh so satisfying to get those legendary threads!. the real star of the show however is night city itself. endlessly explorable, whether hoofing it or climbing up and over or blazing thru the streets on a futurechopper. always new and evolving landscapes and neighborhoods bustling with action and opportunities for trouble or riches, or both. the world of night city is an absolutely stunning work of art the tireless hours put into this fullyrealized megalopolis simply cannot, for me, be brushed aside or dismissed. this game is the real deal. again i realize my experience is not everyone's, but if i can get so much pure fun and satisfaction out of this sprawling game on just a very basic ps4 and internet connection, i'd urge you to consider cutting thru all the negative chatter out there and just experience this amazing game for yourself."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"played over 100 hrs. did most of the side quests beat the game, got 3 major endings. while the gunplay is good and satisfying the game has some major bugs. for example one time none of the npcs were speaking. another time audio was cutoff completely. random vehicles spawns in front of you. peple and vehicle phasing through ur character. restarting the checkpoint fixes the glitches every time and nine of them are gamebreaking. my game only crashed 3 times in my 102 hrs of playthrough. my problem is with main quest. they are beautifully designed, unique and engaging but its short. the gaem can be completed in 15 hrs. the best part lies in the side quests. they are indistinguishable from main quests and can change the outcome of your ending. the main story is somewhat depressing and though provoking. it asks the meaning of life, death, afterlife, immortality. besides all the issues i had a great time in night city. hopefully cdpr will fix the bugs so that i can start a new game with a different life path."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"bugs are not my biggest problem here but lack of base rpg elements, from the lack of options no body types exc. creating your character to the npc passiveness and not involvement. no law and order mechanics, no faction mechanics, no third person view, no style importance, driving is bad, no car or character customization in game, no tattoo parlour, no hairdresser exc., no food, drink mechanics, you can eat and drink but it doesnt mean really anything, one fix apartment for every type of way you choose, no home modifications....i can go on, but you get the point. if you want fps yes with story, there you go, but if you want open world rpg no dont bother, maybe in near future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i haven't pc, only playstation 4. i've preordered pc version at gog just to support guys as money from gog goes directly to cd project red. will wait another year and will buy ps4 version later also. thank you guys for your work."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game not only doesn't work, but it obviously has a lot of things missing. it's clear that the developers wanted to add more things like more interactions with the mega corps but cdpr just wanted the money. i really don't recommend you to buy it, the game has a lot of bugs and the gameplay is not even that good."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game is, definitely not what i'd expect after waiting 7 years and multiple pushbacks initially supposed to get this in late 2019 then early 2020. i've logged probably 30ish hours on it so far and feel i should tame some of the hype but also stop some of the needless hate let's start with the obvious, what you are playing on matters. i know you guys dont want to read it or hear it, and i am not dismissing responsibility of cdpr of ensuring a title runs smooth on all release platforms. that said, this game was likely scrapped and redeveloped once the specs and dev kits were given to them for next gen consoles. meaning, it was made for midtohigh end pcs and next gen consoles which are basically perfectly tuned mini pcs. i am playing on an xbox series x so majority of the graphical errors and issues do not occur as frequently or even at all in my experience. i also have many friends who play on pc and they relay the same. pros visuals, game is absolutely stunning. the fact that all of the world comes alive, day night transitions are so smooth and the graphics look amazing shows me this is a polished product, the light reflections, the shadows, details on things like weapons the environment. in the beginning i felt this game was your runofthemill watchdogs or even gta openworld environment where it was all pretty like a forza game but not much interaction...completely wrong. the world is just as large if not larger and the amount of interactable doors, places to explore, and environmentals you can affect or interact with is enormous, at times even overbearing... there's just so much to actually do. the story! one of the biggest reasons you should immediately disregard any 1 star review is the story. even if this game looked like absolute crap, the story is amazing. it is nothing too original in terms of media in general, but in terms of a videogame story, nothing else can compare to the concept. its a perfect blend of scifi, mystery, and action. the game has the story depth of heavy rain and the fact that so many of the options you're given for dialogue some of which are timed  can even be used to timeout the chat options and simulate saying nothing do affect the outcome of the story. some in an immediate impact way, others take a few days of gametime or even other missions to realize the impacts i have reloaded several save points just to test as well as receive the effects i want i don't want to go into the actual story because it's that good i dont want to spoil it. when you're playing you almost get the sense that you're watching a movie and in terms of immersion the game just  you in! voices  keanu reeves. i wanted to lump keanu in this section instead of giving him his own pro as to not seem like a fan boy. however, i assumed he was just a heavy gimmick or image used to advertise the game with a few cameos thrown in here or there like norman reddus in the mail delivery simulator but i was pleasantly surprised he is a huge part of this game, not just in voice lines but in the story and visuals, hell you even play as him at some point and i felt like a complete badass. you can tell he is actual acting in this game, not just reading voice lines. now to the actual voicelines, this will go in the pro and cons section, the voice acting is topnotch and smooth, fluid, even though they give you the options to fastforward through dialogue, this is the one instance in a game where im just not tired of it like standard rpgs. now for the cons bugs. yes the game has bugs. i dont know why i was surprised, i guess i assumed with all the delays that it wouldn't. majority are small, warping, slight rendering issues, and the occasional dialogue stuttering, i havent experienced anything game breaking npcs. when i say npc i mean the bystanders walking around in the game. it's just so elderscrolls i saw a mudcrab or gta duck and run. no one foghts back and the cops are useless. crafting. there is much to be desired in terms of crafting and qol no crafting slider for multiples weapons. surprisingly not many. there is a lot left to be desired in terms of potential with it being the future and all. that said, the quickhack and body mod syatem is pretty cool."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"when cdpr was delaying this game months ago , i was thinking they want to make sure its perfect and was very excited about this game. after playing the game for around 10 hours i only found 1 area that they excelled on and that's the graphics as i am playing on the pc. this game is lacking in so many areas that a game like gta v looks next gen . ai in this game non existent. physics are non existent and the police system is totally broken spawning in front of you instantly while running away 2 blocks makes them lose you. im only giving this game a 7 because the people that worked hard on it and wasnt their fault. the fault goes to the top level that released un unfinished game. the only way to fix this game is to start from scratch with good ai , physics and gameplay. not shocked 2020 ended in disaster with this game sadly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i'm sorry for now it is a great wasted opportunity. yet the graphics of the setting are not bad ... i'm playing on a staff so in terms of performance i have no problems. unfortunately everything else is the problem rigid animations, models that get stuck inside the walls, police who shoot you because you passed them, people who talk without looking at you and without moving their lips, characters too rigid without charisma, missions that get stuck, very difficult to climb a ladder. .. too many bugs. but i also dislike the narrative, it is not consistent with my actions, the story does not change according to my choices, i do all stealth without killing anyone and the boss tells me you made a slaughter and then the only way to exiting the area is to shoot everyone. i don't see all this freedom. and the cops .... the cops if you break the law, but even if you don't, they appear from the walls and out of nowhere. no this is not the game i expected and i'm sorry because the premises were all too many."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"bugwise, cyberpunk is far better than the average bethesda game. story is excellent, graphics are excellent  really everything is excellent. this is on a pc with a gtx 1070ti gpu. about two gens back. i would not recommend it for an xbox or ps 4. excuse me i have to get back in game. 60 hours and running..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"personally have not had too many issues yet. was unplayable at 1440 for me until i did the ryzen hack, which shouldn't be something the end user has to do. have a very highly overclocked gtx 1080 and graphically, it's been great after the hack. as for the glitches i also have not really come into many, personally. some items cannot be picked up, bodies sometimes hover outside the trunk and npcs mouth's don't move when they talk or they twitch oddly if they're on the floor. other than that, i've really enjoyed the game and the story line so far."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"hot take but i think they actually undersold this game. because they didn't market it much as a cd projekt red game. never met more convincing characters in a game, main and side quests are of extremely high quality in terms of story telling and even the side gigs analogous to witcher 3's monster hunts are more fleshed out than you might expect, however still don't expect them to be as interesting or multistaged go somewhere, stealkillrescue, leave. open world is pretty  mid but it wasn't that great in the witcher 3 so my expectations were pretty low, cops spawn out of your literal  if you do anything wrong, don't even turn up in cars. combat is pretty fun and only gets more fun as you progress and get better stuff like cyberware body modifications. i think witcher 3 has it beat on open world exploration, which is a shame because it's obviously more vertical even if the extent of its verticality was exagerated slightly prerelease. driving feels lighter in some cars than you would expect, that's about my only complaint about it. i found bugs to be in concentrated patches during certain quests, going for hours without seeing a single one, maybe the occasional floating objects, followed by periods of immersion breaking bugginess. played on an aging midrange pc, using digital foundry optimized nonrt graphics settings at 1080p averaging 40fps."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,". as the majority of the complaints are about bugs, glitches and misleading graphicsgame play, the game, to me, is just boring and confusing. i have watched multiple tips and guides and it is just too 'heady' for me and i play rpgs all day long. moreover designed elements such as the minimap, life bar, grenades, are so small or hard to see it feels like they are assuming everyone plays this game on a 10000 inch tv with super high def. update after 60 hours of gameplay i have never experienced so many bugs in a game. one play through of any beta tester would have seen this. what a bunch of con artist... finally, the actual first person shooting game play, is rough. sensitivity is all over the place even when adjusting and driving a car is just comical. oh if you are on xboxps4 this game is almost useless"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"to wait 7 years to get this garbage aggravates me, especially since what these guys did with the witcher series. technical mess aside, this is not even close to their usual rpg prowess. choices that don't matter, side missions from text from call, lifepath and gangs were a  joke. no wonder they dropped the rpg and just stick to actionadventure at the 11th hours. where are the meaningful choices? where are the story where you actually built connection to the rest of the world? how the  are this world changes with your choices when they barely react at all. where are the narrative flows that made heart of stone and blood and wine game of the  year for multiple years?? not even a thank you from the side mission npc after you saved them?? what is this garbage ai from 2002? ac valhalla was more of an rpg than this  i'm a fan of this studio since the first witcher but after this game and todd howard level of lies and deceptions from trash, i'm done with them. hell will freeze before i touch or preorder anything off this garbage studio ever again. lazy, unspiring, bland,  mediocre. to come to this from the witcher 3 is a  insult!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i am really sad, that this game got into such a situation. maybe they should've delayed it once more. maybe they shouldn't have released it on ps4 and xone .but what is done is done. i understand that people are not happy at all, i at first bought this game for xone as well and was awfully surprised. but then i realized, i can play it on geforce now or google stadia, since my pc setup just can't handle this thing. and guess what .. it works as a charm. i mean you can't get ultra raytracing wihtout performance dlss and the stream is only in 1080p but it looks quite ok and the fps are decent, so i can finally dive into this game and focus on what's really important  gameplay and story. i'm currently about 30 hours in doing every side quest the game offer and i must say, i am impressed. not one side quest was similar in any way. the side quest are mostly not shallow and tells interesting stories and make you do tough decisions i think the witcher signature is totally there. these decisions does now affect other stories but it sure affect the way the side quest develops. and i am perfectly fine with it since the characters in side quests do not meet each other at least i haven't noticed it. the main story is imo interesting. the start is little bit slower but i think this is compensated in later parts of the story. but i cannot judge it completely yet it since i haven't finished it. driving is ok. yes, it feels like you are on ice and blah blah blah. you can make it quite stylish though if you get used to it. lot of times i drived into group of enemies in one big drift and felt like in the action movie. shooting is quite enjoyable for me, have a borderlands feeling a little and once you get some cool weapons it feels really good. personally love the tech weapons cause i am not a good shooter. ai is not really dumb i think, but always could have been better. i am playing it on hard and the npcs can sometimes surprise me. of course they will eventually stay in some position or give you some window, so you can stealth kill them as in countless other games. i am not ok with police spawning around you though, that is stupid, but i learned to play in a way, when i just not attract them anymore e.g. i am careful about civilists when i shoot or drive. and the police is just not a my problem anymore. graphics are great, not stunning. raytracing is really cool but you have to compensate it with dlss at least on geforce now, so everything is rendered in lower resolution and looks kinda blurry. i personally chose to play on ultra settings withou raytracing since sharpness on image is more important to me. the graphics may not be stunning but the night city desing is. thought i will get bored if the game takes part only in one city, but it is not the case. i constantly happen to find new different areas, every one of them looks kinda different and i must say i am really enjoying it. time for bugs. bugs i encountered were mostly funny, nothing game breaking really playing on patch 1.0.4. i still believe in them even they surely unterestimated the launch. i have encountered some immersion breaking bugs such as during one side quest the lighting was changing from day to night mode. but i think cdpr is not ordinary game company and will fix them asap. i am kind of dissapointed that you can't have meaningful conversation with random people on the streets, or e.g .you can't order and drink a beer in the bar with animation and some other stuff, but hey it's a really big came full of content you can enjoy and it must have been really hard to develop something like this. also for me such little things just don't matter. i am not looking for a digital second life or something like that. think this game is overall better than most of the games i played recently mostly because of content it offers, just need to be polished for a while. the hype train was too big and fast and it kinda derailed but as soon as the developers fix it and put it back on track i think i can take us to the final destination. we just need to sit tight and wait same as v in a lot of side quests  i think it is rush and wait or something like that in the game. other things that comes to my mind right no i enjoy about the game  photo mode character development delamain side quests brain dances johny silverhand other things that comes to my mind right now i don't like so much  mirror bug  v's apartment unused potential  little amount of romance options  ability to see what clothes look like before you buy them i would give this game normally 810 because of bugs and small things i didn't personally like, 910 once the bugs are fixed, but i give it 1010 to compensate all the meaningless reviews of people who doesn't have setup to play this game proprerly and ps4 or xone players who doesn't know there is a separate review page for console"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"played about 2 hours of the story and messed around in the world for a while exploring and stuff. honestly its cool. i like the gameplay for the most part. its a bit too glitchy and performs like crap. its clear to me that the streaming engine they use to stream their assets in is totally borked. i'm not even a game developer and i can clearly see tons of pop in and awful texture glitches on random objects even on an i7 4790, gtx 1070, 16gb ram, plus the games on an ssd. if this issue is that apparent to people how did someone on the beta testing team not catch this? great idea horrible execution. come on cdpr get it together"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this game is an insult to the dev's work and to the gamers supporting it. this game shouldn't receive so much praise considering the buggy mess it is, this game should have been delayed by at least one more year. never in my life, even as a qa tester have i seen so many gameplay breaking bugs on day one ... so i ask you this ... would you buy a new car from a dealership, drive it for the first time and then seeing how it's constantly loosing integrity, then saying to yourself yes i think i will keep this ... please do yourself and the community a favor and refund this. this is not acceptable in 2020 ... receiving crap sold for a pretty buck as something premium, crap bought from your hard earned money ! respect your time and your work ! frankly if you want a cyberpunk feeling you are better of playing the deus ex series ..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i'd give it a 10 if it wasn't for the sporadic ai pathing bugs and character geometry clipping with the world. there's also some unfortunate things like under realize police system, the cops are a bit of a after thought unfortunately, there's still hope they fix some of that with post launch patches, i'm writing this review a week after launch, and i'm about 15 hours in. the world is really well realized, it's really impressive what they achieved here, i love night city so much, i very rarely drive my car to quests, i just walk my way there, taking the sights in, looking at the advertisements, looking at the incredible vehicle design, seeing the sun setting on this techy futuristic city is a feeling like no others. video games are very special, only video games can truly transport you to other worlds, and make you feel like you're there, and cyberpunk really tries hard to do that. the gameplay is really good too, the shooting is pretty satisfying, once you get used to the fact that this is a rpg and the enemies are a bit of bullet sponges. it's a shame fort the bugs at release, i'd give it a 10 if it wasn't for that. play it for the immersion and story alone, and you wont be disappointed."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,the games kinda ok in its current state. its got a a lot of bugs and at some parts just unenjoyable. the game without the bugs would be atleast a 910 but it will take them at least a year to patch all of these out. the lifepaths only change the first part of the game then they meet in the middle then split apart again best way i can put it. the perks and upgrades are really fun to mess around with. the games main story is 2540 hours long depending on how you play it. there are alot of great side missions some better than the main story. but overall this game is good i wouldn't recommend to console players in its current state but if you have a decent pc it is a great game and i recommend it if you dont mind the bugs now and again
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"after the last gen console desaster i had to write a review for the pc version because this one is almost perfect. there needs to be a few bugfixes two of whom are very annoying but would spoiler the game. other than that there is the last bit missing some controls are wonky especially driving and doubletab wasd while fighting or going stealth breaks crouch, other than that the game is huge fun and has the potential to become legendary over time. it would have been an instant classic if cd project had focused all resources on two platforms e.g. pc and next gen consoles instead of also releasing it on last gen."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"sure there are plenty of side missions and interesting gigs, but this game stinks of cut content and ideas. i had almost convinced myself after an unhealthy 80 hours. the issue is they clearly cut a lot from the game to make the date. here are the main issues from someone who preordered, loved the witcher series and really wanted this to work 1. the city feels vapid and empty despite npcs  they just wander up and down  the same fat guy with the waddle with different clothes, the guy with an itchy shoulder with different clothes. the same gangs, in the same areas. the police who appear out of thin air, but also lose interest within a block of drivingrunning. 2. sure a lot of houses you entered in tw3 were samey, but at least you could go in them. in cb2027 you simply cannot go into many buildings in the city, you are kept almost exclusively on the street until a particular mission. the lifts in buildings only go to the floors related to your current mission. 3. there is no real progression of my character, other than some stats. i cannot upgrade my apartment, or move. my car is what i buy or get as a reward  no customisation at all . even with roach i could add a new saddle, trophy... 4. they didn't keep the mechanic from tw3 where the character you are following will match your speed. you either are slowed to a walk, or if you break out of the envelope they run after you! 5. you jog everywhere, you cannot just walk, which makes point 4 weird! 6. it is clear that the more open nature of missions was cut from earlier demonstrations  remember meredith, they showed you scouting it out with jackie  which makes more sense with the conversation with the guard about whether you are alone. 7. sick of the breaching mechanic after the 50th time. 8. 90 of conversation options have zero effect on the outcome, and in many cases how they respond to you. bugs aside, i was looking forward to this game and feel severely let down. despite having had a fair chunk of time playing it and enjoying some of it, it still feels like a poor facade for what the original intent promised."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,many errors in the game mechanics and many bugs. the mechanics between the primary and secondary missions are very confusing. weather effects need to improve as well as some aspects of the game's physics.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game is not mediocre, but neither is it the great open world innovation that was promised. worst of all is how the press as always was absolutely bought to put 1010 on this. i also believe that the reason why the game came out early was due to pressure from shareholders. but yes, the game is not up to what it was proposed to do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"it looks nice, but the gameplay is pretty generic including bullet spongey enemies, linear level design when doing quests, an overemphasis on cutscenes, limited dialogue options, and an average story overall imo. also literally every ad in the game is pornographic. and i mean to a degree you might as well be visiting prnhub instead. why? its a decadent society, sure, but why waste resources developing a pointless naked function in character creation, when they could have focused on making a proper rpg with decent gameplay design and actual rpg elements as advertised!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i will say this straight away i have a good pc and i understand that this game is unoptimized i would hope i could gain better fps but luckily i can play at a playable fps. firstly i wanna talk about the stunning visuals of this game in and out of night city the graphics are the best i have ever witnessed in a game. the world accompanies the graphics with the tall buildings and good looking advertising boards across them. some people would disagree and say they expected more but i came into night city with low expectations because i didn't watch any videos hyping it up. another thing i love about this game is the choice you have when doing any mission you can do it stealthy or shoot every enemy even in any side mission as well as main mission. by the way the side missions in this game are just as good as the main missions, they are very in detail and you meet new characters and earn many rewards by playing them. you can also choose how to take on a mission with the character you are talking with. if you want you can even completely disregard a job. the combat in this game i like a lot with all the different weapons you can use it makes it a fun experience. the enemies are sometimes hard to sneak pass making you use your hacking abilities to distract them and take them out. some missions are very hard and are accompanied by bosses which are hard to take down. however as you may have heard the game has many bugs but not as bad as you may have seen on consoles. i even experienced a bug which was frustrating and meant i could not progress the story further so i had to start again. the game also has some graphical issues eg cars not rendering in properly and characters. i also felt the game lacked interaction when walking through night city sometimes no cars were on the road or people not walking the streets even on max settings. i believe this game will be great in a few months when cdpr can release patches to fix the game but some of these glitches you would of thought wouldn't be there after 8 years of development. overall, i give this game a 910"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"me parece una vergenza lo que hizo cdprojekt viendoles la cara a muchos usuarios, mentirles, estafar y robar el dinero de manera descarada. un juego lleno de bugs, cracheos y texturas horribles, gran diferencia a lo que se mostr en la demo del 2018, juego censurado, una ia lamentable, en pocas palabras es basura."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,the game is not bad in itself i but it lacks a soul. it feels empty. i am putting aside for now until some nice update are out
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,great roleplaying game with fascinating story but evolution didn't happen.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,yes this game has some issues but when its fixed this game is a masterpiece.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this game at the time of writing this review  december 2020 feels like a game that is about 75 complete. you can tell they cut corners to release the game before the christmas holiday. cyberpunk is not the 'next generation rpg' as they described it. there's nothing groundbreaking about it. the story is pretty good but beyond that, it's nothing new and its not polished. the city is amazing, i have to hand them that. the map is truly immersive and well done but that's where it stops. it's not a terrible game but any means but it's nothing to look twice at. it doesn't have the bugs on pc that the console users are dealing with so that's something but it feels like it's missing features. npc's will randomly appear on the sidewalk and disappear into thin air just as quickly. the driving is not great and while the character creation is pretty good, you cant do the simple things like change your character's visuals change hair color for example. the tech tree is pretty nice and detailed and they do allow you to respec your character but it costs a ridiculous amount of money and makes it not worth it. save your money and wait for a discount or maybe my review will change once they release more content in 2021."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,i didn't like it at all. it was very buggy and so many promised features were missing. story was also meh.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"most of the negative reviews are form people that thought this game will be gta or cod. sponge enemies? yes this is an rpg and the more you progress and upgrade your skill the better combat gets. graphics are fantastic. story is great, characters are all great, lots to do beside main  me side quests are what is the best in this game. also i dont care about consoles this is only for pc and the pc version is just fantastic."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"where to begin? the fact the game should be a crossgen game, and yet it doesn't perform very well in previous gen and don't push the nextgen, its a buggy middle mess, with false advertise , cd projeket red did very good in ruining the most hyped game in last decade, its the top gaming scam has ever seen, cuz what has been shown in trailers and gameplay didn't arrive, many features have been deleted or not even made in last version of game , so who owns a pc need to have like a very highend pc to play the game with less bugs , and we all know most of the pc gamers out there owns 1660 gtx  580 rx or 1060 gtx most the gamers are midrange, at least they play the game at 1080p 30 fps , since the highend pc's should run it in 4k 60 fps , so cdpr you really shot ur selfs in leg by lying about the game , hiding facts , pushing the game , and lying about specs requirement , the reason why i didn't give it a 0 score , is just cuz we still love witcher 3 game"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this not the living, breathing world that we were promised and that they spoke about on trailers. npcs either pedestrian or drivers have absolutely no day and night cycle or routine. the police spawning is complete  the lifepaths were an utter slap in the face, they last for 15 minutes and all railroad you into the same story. there are no minigames or immersive activities that you can engage in such as dancing, drinking, eating, hooking up with predetermined npcs or going to strip clubs. that montage was aboslutely ridiculous and they still used it in the trailers as if to say that you could do all that the side stuff mostly includes killing or stealing something. very limited character creator. very few acessories and tattoos. was i supposed to care about jackie ? because you showed a damned montage and the game said that we were all buddies ? that's not how relationships work. the street cred system also seems to work only so you can buy new guns, mods or cyberware as well as new gigs shoot or steal. i've only seen my street cred value work once when some gangers were harassing a street vendor but backed off when they knew who i was. other than that you might as well be some nameless merc, the world doesn't react to you, people don't talk or write about how much of a badass you are. romance options are very limited and even after you finish the romance you can barely interact with them after. one of the romance options will text you once after the romance is completed and that is it. driving is very floaty and cars are very hard to control. also a personal complaint is how lame stealth takedowns are, it's always the same two animations of you breaking the persons neck. much prefer the takedowns in the far cry games. story and characters are quite good though, really liked johnny, takemura and panam, some of the side missions are super interesting, like the one you do for one of the candidates for mayor of night city. the city is absolutely beatiful too and really comes alive at night with all the neon. gameplay is ok, the shooting is nothing too innovative but works fine. the lifepaths, lack of immersive side activities, limited romance options and ai are what soured my opinion towards this game. i will be very wary of the next games cdpr puts out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i love it. i took it as an open world rpg set in a cyberpunk setting and it hit all the right spots for me. reminds me of a mixture of shadowrun, deus ex and witcher 3. i love how in all the little encounters and side quests there are things to read that can give you an idea of what was going on. like stories within stories, high level of attention to detail. the environments and interiors are all fairly unique which is a suprise given how many there are. also i think something really cool was accomplished in this game. in witcher 3, skyrim, those sort of rpg's, travelling around was a chore, but driving around night city is sweet. i haven't even been tempted to fast travel yet 50 hours in or so."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"absolutely amazing game, this is on par with rdr2 and gta but in a unique setting that hasn't been done right yet. it doesn't feel as big as those games but then again those games had a lot of empty space while every piece of the map in cyberpunk is alive. i cannot stop playing this game! the combat choices, story, graphics and city are all fun. it runs very well too i haven't seen any big bugs, but typical ones you would expect with a game this big. such as npcs getting stuck on walls or being unable to loot items. the issues i have with it are minor such as being locked into the attributes you choose."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"witcher 3 was never anything special. it takes actual talent to make livingbreathing open world and they completely failed with cyberpunk 2077. they didn't even get to gta 4 level and that's just sad. i have been working on video games past 20 years and i can tell, it's extremely easy to make forests and landscapes like witcher 3 has. i could make demo game like witcher 3 in 5 months. it takes way more talent to make games like gta 4, where you need to make all the buildings, put everything into right places, make cars feeltraffic feel natural, make npc's feel natural, etc. they just proved that they have no idea how to do it. they had 8 years. that's very long time for game development. what makes me most angry is the that they they knew what state this game was in. they knew it and they still promoted it as next generation of open worlds. absolute lie. i will never forgive this company, i can't support something like that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,the game is impassable. crits and bugs. bad graphics. the game is clearly not finished yet.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"even with no bugs, this game is a big lie. there aren't a lot of customizations herecars, character, guns etc. there is no mini game like gwent. most dialogue choices end up to same results. crappy ai. and a ton of cut content which was promised in trailers. this is not rpg at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the rating is 0, i just cant review a game that its not finished. on the other hand, the demo you have released its amazing! im sure that in time, maybe next december it will be at least 70 complete. remember 2013. out .. when its ready'"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"game summary  bug  crash  frustration  good history  big false advertisement. the biggest disappointment of gaming industry, ps4 one versions are unplayable and look like early ps3 game . npc's are also early ps3 level. this game feels like amateurish average game from 2015 , if they really spent 8 years on this, they should give up game development right now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this game is great, some few bugs but i had a lot of fun in the 20 hours i played cyberpunk 2077. nobody expected a gta 6 from this game. cdpr is in my eyes not a big company like rockstar games or even ubisoft yet, they developed only two big games until now, so i think they made it awesome though."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"very good rpg game, good plot, night city looks amazing. very intresting and excelent characters. but... very bad model of driving is like a driving at iced streets what is very annoying. not bad shooting. some bugs but not a lot of 1.04 version. police is boring and useless. to sum up its very good rpg game but thats not good action game. but from the beggining it was rpg game so i give 810"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"yes, cyberpunk is an objectively buggy mess on an operational level. i play on an xbox one and experience a crash roughly every hour, have visual artifacts pop up and even have sequences during missions where events never trigger and v ends up locked in limbo until reloading the game. that said the game is rad if you enjoy narrative driven gameplay. ive logged something in the neighborhood of 15 hours in game and i just got to the actual story since ive been sidetracked by the overwhelming number of extra curricular activities within night city. the characters are intriguing and the story itself is very engaging. this is not a game for people who just hammer on a or x every time a conversation halts to do so is to deprive yourself of the games truest achievement. the gameplay loop is fun enough but weapon variety is lacking and most missions do boil down to go here, kill guys, repeat. this would be a problem if it were not for the quickhack system, which offers pretty endless possibilities for problem solving based on your tastes. that said if you want to bust in guns blazing there are rarely any provisions in place to keep you from doing so successfully. stealth is implemented well, but can largely be abandoned if thats not your thing so far stealthing my way through missions has yielded little to nothing in the way of extra awards. same with choosing murder over non lethal options. the character creation does leave plenty to be desired especially since you cannot alter your appearance beyond your outfit after youve exited the creator a pretty massive oversight in a game where customization was a huge selling point. the armor system is disappointing in its lack of customization as well so far there have been no dyes or other options like sleeves rolled up, untuck shirt etc. this absolutely leads to that disappointing rpg trope of mismatched hodgepodge armor that you wear for the stats over the aesthetics. since this is such an aesthetic based game youd think cdpr would have implemented more robust customization options. without the glitches the game is easily a 9 if story is important to you. its not without its shortcomings, but it is still an engaging and satisfying gameplay experience. shady release aside its not like weve reached electronic arts levels of contempt. just another early release to capitalize on the holiday season. im willing to give it a pass and wait for the patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,i love this game and had over 60h fun with it but it painfully hasn't a ng and some minor bugs i noticed i hope they add ng if they do so this game isa a 1010 for me
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"cyberpunk is delvers impressively from a story and world perspective. the attention to detail in these regards is generally exceptional. there's a few spots where the specific events are rather confusing because the cdpr cut part of the quest out and they never went back to remove it. but those events are few and far between. the way they integrate johnny silverhands was unique and well done. voice acting there is sooooo much voice acting and most of it is well done. i noticed the man behind johnny silverhands wasn't the best voice actor in the universe... but let's be honest here. did ya expect anything different? i mean you've seen at least one of his movies right? the only thing that surprises me here is that people we're surprised by kr's voice acting. while the voice acting added to immersion it also removed some as well. because you no longer have a running log of what was said and what you said on the screen... it can be difficult to fully appreciate the choices your making. polish this game just wasn't... at all. there's so many bugs in so many places i'm amazed it was released in this state. i understand games will have bugs... but this is extreme. combat this can be quite a bit of fun however some of the coolest stuff is locked behind leveling. getting headshots, mid air, with enemies all around you with time slowed down is deeply satisfying. there's also various weapon modifications that can change how you approach various situations. progression hard felt like it was hard, partly because i didn't realize i was supposed to be questing in a different part of town. anyhoo, you can feel you're character is getting better in the world in which they exist. nonlinear story they get some points deducted here because you generally have no idea if your choice actually made a difference. from what i've read it is possible to change the outcome but it's not obvious to me, at all, while playing the game. every time i've save scummed, on many quests, the outcome is almost always the same. ai there is almost 0 intelligence to anything ai related. some of the worst i've ever seen... ever. npc's on the streets are clearly an after thought. car ai behaves as if they were made by a college student in a last ditch effort to pass a class. cp gets an f here. crafting they didn't play test this enough. who the hell thinks it's ok to click and hold the craft button, wait 1 second.. then rinse and repeat that literally 100's of times.. wtf. pure cancer. cp gets a c here because crafting is cool and it does add to the game... it just needs some qol. breaching this is pretty cool, had a ton of fun with it. i wish you could do more with it but i'll take what i can get. cp gets an a here. balance it's clearly not. the stats are multiplicative and no recalculated from the base... i'm not sure if i have a problem with this so i'm not going to grade it. tbh, it's fun thinking about the different types of characters you can build because of this. economy it's a static economy and i didn't expect anything more i mean why is that need in an rpg?. trading they get an f here. jesus guys, so many qol's missing on this. i don't want to trade equipped items, so don't list em by default. there's no quick sell for the kajillion items you have. you might argue that qols aren't that important but lets be honest here. when it comes to trading, beyond making an integer move up or down, it's all qol. pace the game tries to rush you due to the story, i don't think it actually makes good on that threat but it's still kinda annoying. why didn't you guy's say thing x will cause extreme problems for you 1 year from now.. that was a pretty foolish imo. weapons so you get pistols, machine guns, snipers, and shotguns. there's alot of different types of those weapons mentioned. it'd be nice if there was some more imaginative weapons? like a bouncy bomb, how about a beam weapon? how about an acid soaker? a flame thrower? a taser? sure, you have weapon effects that will shock or start people on  you don't have weapons that throw fire or emit electricity visually. if you're looking for the next gta, keep looking. if you're looking for a great rpg, you should buy this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i don't review things online very often, but i felt compelled to weigh in given some of the negative things i've been reading about cp2077 and cdpr. witcher 3 was my favorite game and i think cp2077 has usurped it. the gameplay, story, and overall worldbuilding are incredible and well worth experiencing, even if bugs are making that hard for you right now. be patient. they'll fix it. graphics and performance awesome i played through it on pc with a 1660s. i encountered some issues early on with trees visible through walls, but updating the nvidia driver fixed this entirely. beyond that i was very impressed. bugs surprisingly not bad i heard stories about the launch bugs for witcher 3 so i was expecting something similar. honestly, for me it was fine. every once in a while there'd be something with a quest marker or an unresponsive npc, but it would usually sort itself out within a few seconds. in a few cases i needed to restart the game to get things moving forward and this always worked. happened maybe four times over sixty hours of play time. gameplay awesome both the combat and build system are fun, fluid, and leave a lot of room for creativity. it's true that the side missions can get a bit samey, but if you play on very hard highly recommended you will start to appreciate the environmental differences much more. story extremely awesome the overall story arc is brilliantly executed and very moving. avoid spoilers. follow your gut and just see how it unfolds. play it again or reload to try something later on if it wasn't what you wanted or were expecting. i found that making bad choices make the good ones that much more poignant later on when i tried it another way. do the side quests, too. cp2077 is extremely well written."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i have play this game non stop since release, and yes it has some bugs, even more then some but a lot of them are caused by low specs pc but not all of them. but what is worth i never found any game breaking bug on pc version . i am playing on ancient pc i7 2600k and 1070 and still have 60 fps on medium settings. game is really fun and give you a lot for your money. i dont remember last time when i have so much fun in game and i play a lot of different games. remember witcher 3 was a mess at start but with time they made it one of best games out there and i belive same thing will happends with cp2077. fight, stelth, loot, drive systems are solid, ai need some work but story is awesome and solid."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"as it is right now? this game is a 5 out of 10. in 612 months after it has been largely fixed on a technical level? it will likely be a 78 out of 10. it will be either a solid game in the like of gta5 or fallout4. or if they just fix the technical bugs it will be worse than both. a 67 out of 10. almost everything we were told about the game is not cut content, the ai is terrible. driving is terrible. the world doesn't make sense in a lot of areas. the ai for driving literally does not exist. the world is not vertical this honestly a version of gta that looks like it came out the year after gta. only slightly better and that is before we get to the bugs. because this is without a drought the buggiest game i have ever seen... on launch day. buggier than fo4. gta5. rdr2. tw3. and that is before we get to the discussion of consoles or poor faith from the company. this has basically wipped out all of the good faith that most people had with cdpjr. wich as far as i'm concerned is fine. there games are fine, but the hype around them was always misplaced."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"why is everyone talking about console optimization but no one is talking about the pc performance? it's horrible aswell! they recommended gtx 1060 6gb the most popular gpu according to steam survey for 1080p but it can't even run at lowest settings at 60fps. frametime is ridiculous. major fps fluctuation when driving. flickering. popin and hitching even with ssd. no, it is not much better on pc. it needs some serious optimization in every platform!!!!!! to specialized media with fancy rigs i dont care about ray tracing. i just wanna play the game at 1080p 60fps. they marketed like it was possible!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"in short  this game is just brilliant buy it. the quality of shooting and racing is good however i am not an expert nor a true gamer it is not me who should judge that i just had fun. but frankly for me it could all be removed and i would still love this game. the story is the most moving and thoughtprovoking one in a video game i have ever seen my entire life. if the witcher was about destiny and lesserevil, cyberpunk77 is about our humanity, ai and the nature of a human brain. and the story is not just deep it is also thrilling and moving. there are no flat characters all of them are special there are true friends or hated enemies etc. etc. the side missions are close to the quality of the main story and each one of them could make a separate game. i have never binge played a game because i am not a real gamer but here i couldn't stop playing. it is really sad to see all the hatred that goes to cyberpunk. people who really expected the fps game are now disappointed. also the pc version is reviewbombed by console players angry about the current state of the game on their devices. i can't refer to that but on pc mine is at the normal price it runs fine and the small bugs don't destroy this masterpiece. if you don't care about the story and plan to skip all dialogues don't buy this game you will hate it. the amount of shooting is low so you will feel more like in a cinema than in a video game. go play gta or cs or something like that i am not criticizing those games they can be a cool way to burn your tim but if you want a high quality story stop reading reviews and just buy this game. btw i have never written a review longer than ok but i think i owe something to the game i felt in love with."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i love a story in this game, all side quests are just brilliant. gameplay is not perfect at start, but longer you play , better it become. they made a very good job. just one thing that they should wait with console version a little bit longer, rockstar also doing that with pc version and everyone are good with that."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"environment city, immersion, story telling, character depth, dialogues, music  all are unmatched for a video game. main and side quests are put together very well and dont feel at all like an ubisoft generic open world game. my main complaint about cyberpunk are design choices a how the main story ends and leaves you prior to the final instead in the aftermath b i was hoping for a little darker more blade runner tone c over the top art style ragelike gangs c ai and combat style d lack of corporation impacts besides arasaka night city is the main attraction and a master piece, reminds me of hong kong. unfortunately like all these open world games  lacks an end game... putting together builds is fun and all but i dont understand why open world games dont focus on a survival aspect instead of looter shooter  gear..... the bugs are well documented  didnt break the immersion for me and the game was beautiful looking and performing well on my i7 1080ti"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i feel that there are a lot of negative reviews because of the performance on last gen consoles. the game is flawed but it is one of the most amazing open world experiences ever. the npcs, the story which is absolutely amazing in terms of writing, the feel of the city are all there. it is not the most incredible game of it's genre and the story is a bit short but i think it is a unique experience which i enjoyed for almost 70 hours. i would gladly replay this game and i will recommend it to people who enjoy rpgs. on pc i never encountered a game breaking bug, just small ones like floating weapons and npc's who die funnysome remain standing if you snipe them. i am giving this game a 10 because i feel that the effort the developers put into it is immense and i really hope they will make a sequel which would beat least as long in term of game time as other rpgs like witcher 3, ac odyssey and so on."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"in the story plan, in contrast to the technical, the game is a masterpiece. i have already played for 35 hours, while the last 15 hours just performing huge side effects in their volume, the plot of which pulls on whole additions but yes, there are a lot of bugs, alas, in the game, and the ai of the crowd and cars is very depressing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i reviewed this using a nvidia 2080rtx on an i75820k  4ghz. this game has been a lot of fun. i am finding it absolutely riveting. i have not really experienced anything quite like this kind of action cyberpunk rpg since system shock. its been a long time.. the story, setting, and npc interactions are top notch. the only complaint i have is that getting it tuned was a bit rubbish. i had to do some editing of config files to get it to use all my memory and to configure some keys onto the mouse like f. graphic auto settings were terrible. i had to do a lot of tweaking but have it running well with rt  dlss enabled but some other settings turned down to compensate. i should not have had to spend hours working on my settings to get 5060 fps game play. i will say that rt is not done justice with screenshots. it provides a subtle sense of presence that elevates everything. its worth the fps hit although i think the game could have been better tuned. a friend with a ps5, similar performance, is also enjoying it. i would say that 10ish tflops is kind of the min to due this justice at this time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"tldr game's buggy, combat lags, driving controls floaty and delayed, you can get robot arms but can't get a haircut, and the game wants to make fun of you so bad for the genitals they let you choose this game feels unfinished, both in the way it plays and through several bizarre and glaring design issues. on a technical level. i actually got the exact same feeling playing it as i did baldur's gate 3 a somewhat interesting storyline hindered by countless crashes, horrible framerate even on a highend gaming pc, and no optimization whatsoever. the difference here being that baldur's gate 3 was released as an earlyaccess game, while this tries to pass itself off as a finished project. while i could normally forgive glitches and choppy framerate, it becomes an absolute nightmare in combat. especially in melee, where you're expected to block within a split second of being attacked to parry blows, the game chugs when more enemies are onscreen and telegraphs skip and aren't communicated as a result. for some reason, reloading a save while in a combat area seems to restart the enemy ai, and even stationary guards will break their normal patrols to wander the area aimlessly. while this could conceivably prevent savescumming, it seemed unintentional at several points, and was annoying when i had to reload due to a crash or bug. the driving suffers as well, which is surprising considering it's v's main mode of transportation. i found i had to turn the steering sensitivity way down, and even then, there's a massive delay between an input and your car responding. the most glaring issue for me was that it was impossible to maintain speed, meaning if i wanted to drive without crashing on a tight city block, i had to repeatedly tap accelerate to lurch forward a few feet at a time. in terms of design issues, the strangest thing to me was seeing countless characters with prosthetic armslegs, chrome skin, and removable faces, and then realizing that there was no way to change v's appearance in the game you can't even get a haircut, but hats will drastically change your hair at random. while some cyberware can change aspects of v's appearance, there's weirdly no way to preview the changes they make other than saving and reloading if you don't like it. this all adds up to a game where you play as a fairly generic dude with a grey pistolgrip palm and are constantly envious of all of the other actual cyberpunk characters with their chrome skin and weird machine eye sockets. lastly, i know i won't be the first to mention this by a long shot, but. cyberpunk, transhumanist settings and transgendernonbinary themes usually go handinhand, but this game handles it incredibly poorly. in a futuristic setting where bodies are fully customizable and it's not weird to see people with half their faces replaced by flashlights, why on earth would being transgender be considered an oddity? and yet it's used for shock throughout the game most notably in the game's advertisements. it ends up feeling weird that an option in character creation ends up both  and reviled by the game world, not to mention it ends up reading like a cheap and easy punchline. honestly, the advertisements would be a lot more interesting and do more for worldbuilding if the mix it up! slogan was used on an equallysexualized model with cybernetic legs in place of arms. it would carry a much more genuine feeling of shock and oversexualization while matching the tone of much of the rest of the game such as the recurring advertisement of a woman with three mouths."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,love the game if you have the pc that can handle it. there are lots of bugs to clean up and graphical glitching is a thing but the base game is fun and the story is very solid. is not a true shooter though and does not handle as clean as destiny or such well tuned fps. it leans more on the rpg side the house. so dont expect the gun play you will get in siege or another top shelf fps. for what it is though a story action rpg is does it well. once they get a few months behind them and iron out the bugs which should have been addressed during launch i think this will be a real gem. too bad they luanched earlier. with that said i did complete the game and all side quests so it is functional.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game is great, i played with a rtx 2060 on ultra settings  rtx off, dlss on and i have 70 fps average. the game is a 10, but i put a 9 for some bugs i encountered, this weren't a big deal, but in 23 months the game is gonna be a 1010 the story and the music is the best of the game, please do all the secondary missions, there are some that are better than the main quests. great job cd projekt red!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,very good game with awesome mechanics and the plot... was amazing. you must play
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i had to make an account to combat some of the ridiculous reviews about this game that i've seen. worst game of all time? biggest failure in the gaming industry? are you serious? let's calm down. is this game perfect? no. is this game over advertised? yes. is this game terrible? absolutely not. i am having an absolute blast with this game, and feel i got every bit of my 60 worth out of the experience playing it. the world is incredibly imaginative and well designed and it pulls you in from the very beginning. the style, story and setting are all extremely well done and unique. i have not encountered another game that tackled this type of setting before. also, there is a ton of content and almost all of it is engaging and fun to play. to be honest i got overwhelmed a bit with all of the things to do. i am finished with my first main quest playthrough and i still have almost 30 side jobs waiting, and that's not even touching the gigs and other things to do. i haven't even scratched the surface of the character ability builds and customization i can choose. there is a wealth of content, and all of it was super fun to me so far. the game is not ground breaking, but it's on par with other games of it's style. no it's not as good as witcher 3 and the npc's arent as good as some gta games, but honestly that didn't really detract from my gameplay because the story was so good and the gameplay was so fun i didn't even stop to notice. lots of people are complaining about bugs, and that might be true for others. also, the experience for people with lastgen consoles might be completely valid. i played on the xbox series x and the game performed great. i had exactly 3 minor visual bugs that did not impact my gameplay at all, and absolutely no crashes. honestly, the bugs were even kind of funny and didn't really bother me in the least. overall, i understand that cdpr might have oversold this game, and that may upset people. those criticisms are all valid. i also understand that many people might have experienced significant bugs, and those criticisms are valid as well. however, completely trashing this game and giving it a zero score, or calling it this worst game of all time is a complete and utter joke. you shouldn't review games if that is your take. this game has a lot to offer in terms of story, setting, style, and gameplay. like many other games, it has it's flaws and is far from perfect, but it can still offer a heck  time and should not be overlooked. do not believe these ridiculous reviews. the game is more than worth the price."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,game is perfect. i am very amazed this game.  i am really amazed  game have a good plot.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this is not an rpg. this is not a shooter. this is not a game that should have been released or event put out as an alpha. i avoided as many videos as i could before playing the game so as to not colour my opinion of it when it released. i also tried to avoid becoming too hyped for it so as to not be disappointed if it didn't live up to expectations. both of these considered i have become very jaded with the game in a very short timescale. cyberpunk 2020 pnp game was a mainstay of my mid teens and is something i loved. this does not even deserve to share the same name as that wonder of childhood imagination. the list of what is wrong is quite a long one, off the top of my head as follows  driving is abysmal. if they play tested this on mk then i am shocked.  amazing introduction to the game that then abruptly ends and montages into a pale reflection of the first few hours  crafting is a bland inventory screen with no real customisation available  live path choice makes no difference, neither do choices in dialogue. all roads lead to as it were.  no real progressing your life path just a montage mentioned above and things abruptly change.  ai is non existent. all npc's do the very same thing  fps shooting is really bland, the enemies just do one of two things cover and peek out at semi regular intervals or charge headlong into you while you hipfire and down them. and some of the things that were meant to be in the game?  npc daily routines and ai? nope none of that  wanted system and corrupt cops?  techies and controllable bots?  vehicle customization?  the subway? literally the mainstay.  customizable apartments? or moving?  elemental weapons?  clothing stats being based on augments and mods?  weapons being upgradeable and customizable?  customizable backstories?  bringing people back to your apartment?  the day and night cycle affecting the game and world?  dynamic weather? no where to be seen."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"im going to start by saying this game is not goty nor do i believe its game of the decade or even will be that memorable in 5 or 6 years unlike the witcher 3. what i will say is it is a good fun game. im enjoying the game and happy with the purchase. however, i did not have the hype expectations that others had. heres my breakdown and very early impressions. this is a narrative driven game, that must be emphasized. what that means is the world you will be hearing a lot about in reviews and discussion takes a back seat to the narrative. most of what you will be doing is talking to important characters and progressing multiple story arcs. im not saying that in a negative way. the hype the hype for this game was overwhelming. i was one of those people that didnt have very high expectations for this game. if you did come into this game thinking it would be revolutionary or change gaming for years to come you will be disappointed. i will say, from my perspective, it was cool to play a game on launch day that had so much hype. its cool to get in on the ground level of a medium like a season premier of a beloved show or hotly anticipated game such as cyberpunk and experience it along with millions of other people in your generation. it was a first for me and i truly did enjoy the moment. now, i did not believe going into this game that it would be what everyone was praising it to be. i was not disappointed. my expectations were realistic coming in. gameplay the gameplay is average. its honestly a fun game but again its nothing groundbreaking. lets talk about combat. i find the gunplay to be fun. it feels responsive enough for an rpg. it doesnt do anything special and it doesnt critically fail in any arena. just as a side note so you can compare my perspective to your own my favorite fps game for the past few years has been escape from tarkov. onto the driving, its not atrocious but it can be a pain in the  with mouse and keyboard. i find driving in first person very difficult while driving in 3rd person is manageable with some time. i refuse to play games with controllers but if you dont mind and want a smoother experience while traveling around it may be worth it and may bring a more positive experience to your time with the game. the ai is not the most ferocious of adversaries and their driving is pretty abysmal so just watch out. bugs im sure youve heard so ill keep it brief. yes, ive experienced a fair amount of bugs that left me scratching my head as to how some managed to leave the testing space. some were game breaking and required reloads or even restarts. graphics looks good and plays well. im running a system that i would consider high end even though my hardware is outdated at this point. i have a i7 6770k  paired with a 1080 ti and 32 gigs of ddr4 at 3200. im missing out on the rtx but the game runs well with settings at the highest settings. i have a high refresh rate monitor and experience smooth gameplay. atmosphere this is probably the most talked about aspect of this game. i dont agree with everything people have said about the atmosphere of the city. it has been lauded for being the most livelike city people have experienced. i disagree with this. its a very cool looking place dont get me wrong but the npcs in the crowd feel like npcs from any other game you have played. i would even say that the crowd structure of this game doesnt do anything different than a game like oblivion or skyrim. its cool, but i enjoyed the narrative experience far more than i did being in the world itself."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"no spoilers ahead dont worry, i love the game and so should u  i honestly think that the majoritymajority does not mean all of negative user review are made by people that haven't played the game or did for an hour. crying about not being able to change your hairstyle or some bugs. did you forget that the barber in witcher 3 was added as a dlc? did u forget witcher 3 had bugs, patched later? it's just silly to see these reviews based on 3 meme videos on youtube about the bugs. the review bombing looks like the bombing on tlou2, never played but will hop on the hate train, pathetic. honestly in my whole 40 hours of gameplay i experienced maybe 23 bugs? i got shot though a rock and ended up upside down in a tank is that really gamebreaking? the story is insanely immersive, the fact that you're playing your character and it's fpp just adds to it. every side quest has got some flavor in it, although im not the biggest fan of gigs, did like a half of them, same with the witcher 3 monster hunting jobs. after completing most side quests, the main quest and riding around night city i really fell in love with the game. the characters are great and unforgettable. i'd only love it to be longer, the whole game, but that's a plan for the future i guess. the main quest just grabbed me by my heart, insane. . after all, lets remember that the witcher 3 wasnt 210391 hours long too, i had 80 when i did everything from dlcs etc. overall, i hope cdp will learn from the bombings, but i hope they wont succumb to the hate some guys that saw a few memes about bugs wrote. silly."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the storytelling is very compelling. i got fully immersed in the night city. miles tost  seniorlevel designer responsible for the design is a genius. audiovisual feast. on my quite old pc the game runs fine at 1080p60fps in high settings 8year old i73770k, 4year old gtx1080. framerate sometimes dips below 60fps when i travel very fast, but less so than for example in red ded redemption 2 and i do not ride a hire a horse, but drive a fast carmotorcycle. yes there are glitches here and there, but nothing gamebreaking. purely cosmetic things that could be easily ironedout. yes, the character development mechanics could go a bit deeper. early perks are a bit meaningless, but the further you go, the larger their impact. of course game isn't without faults is there any, but pros definitely outweigh cons. overall it's a fantastic experience that i could recommend to any pc owner with hardware more recent than 5years old. p.s. it's not a fake review and i have no ties to cdp red. the review is made purely on experience of my own."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this...game, is yet another perfect example of how truly awful this woke generation is. it's pretty much nothing like they advertised, constant system crashes on ps4, if you pause the game, the graphics do look great, playing however things often get stuck on screen, fall into floors and walls, or don't fully render and look like they belong in minecraft. it feels worse than fallout4 in terms of stability. this is what you get when you have sjw's fire or replace all the people that actually know how to code with people who are just there because to try and appease some useless antifa or liberal group. the voice acting is terrible especially if you're used to rd2 level acting, the music will give you a migraine after 5 minutes, any graphic or playstyle settings you set in the options get reset every time you close and restart the game so you have to go in every time to get the gamma levels and any other options you wanted, including the difficulty! i don't understand why studios hire these people based on their political and social opinions rather than actual game creating ability. taking franchise after beloved franchise and ruining them. just to make a quick buck at the expense of the real fans seems to be the trend these days. it really  with this one because the story and world building are amazing, original and had a ton of potential. too bad it was given to hacks to create. as it sits today, this game should be selling for less than 20.00, it's largely unplayable on console unless you're one of the few who managed to get a ps5. you can play it, just know that you will be resetting your system, reloading saves and will have zero immersion and will get very bored as there is really no variety in the quests other than the main ones"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the toxic hate this game is receiving is crazy. everything being said is so overblown. if you can overlook the minor bugs and more so crashes on console, this game is incredible. the world is large and dense. the city is bustling. the weather and daylight systems make the environment pop even more. the main story is great and so are the few major side stories. the jobs and gigs are fun and enjoyable. most rpgs bore me and i end up getting bored and stop playing. this game i am pretty sure i will close to 100 the main story, jobs, and gigs and likely start all over again with a new gender, life path, and play style once the next gen update arrives."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this game feels extremely amateurish, almost like they hired people who had never made video games before. even main character's shadow looks simply awful. npc's are more dead than in any open world game since 2011. to put it simply, it's bad video game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,this is new gen! great graphics and great history. 1 for bugs on pc but in future will be patch for sure
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"at the time of writing this review, i played the game for 92 hrs and on pc with an fps of 5070 depending on if i was driving a car or not. story the story of cyberpunk 2077 was marketed as an rpg where your choices and lifepaths had a major difference in how your game will progress but what i played was the exact opposite the lifepaths had little to no effect on the game as a whole as they were only 15min and had little to no story building. the choices, in the end, didn't matter either as even if a person did the sidequest because every ending is bad no matter what you choose. gameplay the gameplay in cyberpunk 2077 has different perk trees so that the player can make many builds for many characters adding to replayability but you realize that doesn't matter when the ai is just as bad as skyrim's ai. the ai will repeatedly miss their shots and some will even glitch out due to bugs and even the npc's who drive cars ai won't drive the car any further if you get even a cm in front of them. the police ai is not even existent they will legit spawn out of space and time to get you and the police cars don't chase you at all making for a fall flat police system and the player driving cars is just impossible as driving is so bad that you will mostly be crashing all the time or accidentally killing npc's. graphics the graphics of cyberpunk 2077 are beautiful and show the potential for nextgen graphics but sadly due to all the bugs it drags players out of the immersion. one of the bugs is in the badlands where you are driving and you see lots of cars out in the distance but when you go there location they disappear bringing the player out of their immersion and destroying the experience. the settings in cyberpunk 2077 also offers players fewer ways to turn down the graphics for players with low rigs such as antialiasing and more. controls the controls of cyberpunk 2077 are fine as they provide options for players to remap keybindings to what they like but cd project red should have also included to make dodge one key tap so that many players trying to multitap as to sneak quieter would accidentally dodge and be brought out of sneak and into combat. open world cyberpunk 2077's open world feels empty as all npc's offer generic repeated oneliners and the npc's ai doesn't show them interacting with the open worlds and objects though cd project red did put some fun police quest where you would go and take out scavs but sadly after you do it does not impact night city and npc's don't respond to the player differently in any way. the only interesting openworld quest is the ones given by fixers that give you a small backstory and send you to eliminate some enemies. conclusion cyberpunk 2077 is a game riddled with bugs and broken ai and content that was removed or not focused on and i hope cd project red recovers from this bad game and makes a better one and or patches everything missing in this game back in and removes the bugs because this game has so much potential and i have been having fun playing it but i cannot sit and ignore these problems. most of the reviews on the pc side of metacritic are either all 100 or 1 which is very dishonest and shows that either they haven't played the game or they have rosetinted glasses on and refuse to admit that this game has problems. so cd project red please fix the game because if you don't you will lose all the good faith people put in you and will lose fans forever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"yes there are bugs, but they will be fixed. what lies underneath is an 1110 compared to most triple a games being released nowadays."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"well, maybe it is buggy as hell but still, this is a hell of a piece of game with a great story and nice gameplay, totally worth it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i always like the concept of cyberpunk and cdpr showed me this amazing design of night city. although, there are a lot of bugs for the time being which means i will not give a full mark to this game temporarily. however, i can see the potential in this game and i sincerely hope that the later updates can make this game perfect. i will come back and change my score by then."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,ai is not smarter than a potato. lifepaths dont affect anything in the game. every dialogue choices lead always to the same conclusion. i am not even gonna mention bugs it has. it should not be allowed to publish unfinished games while in daily life we cannot have money for doing the same thing.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i did not have a metacritic account before this, but having read some of the reviews, i thought i need to share thought of someone who played more than 3 hours of the game. tldr review i have completed 90 of the games content, having spent around 80 hours. i did not go for a second playthrough yet and did not mess about with talentscrafting too much. this game is absolutely worth the money if you are on pc. i played on i7gtx3080 installed on ssd and it ran smooth as butter as it did for my partner i51080 on ssd. it is immersive, it is fun, it scratched most itches i have. if you are readying this beyond jan 2021, i hope it will also be smoother on consoles f for you last gen consoles, cyberpunk was never meant for you voice acting is great, although keanu's work as johnny was 5050 for me. unlike a lot of reviewers, i do not wish this had another year in production because i understand that we live in a capitalist hellscape and paying for testers and more development is hardermore expensive than releasing a game and letting people test it for you. big shout outs to tomasz marchewka and pawel sasko and their team for the story  quests, bartosz ochman and hiroshi sakakibara and their teams for night city. this review is split into good and bad. as a general reference, i am a white cis  female. i have 400 hours on bg3 early access, 700 divinity os, 400 on mass effect series, dao, da2  dai also hawke's story is stier, warden is atier, inquisitor is b, f1, f2, f3  f4 34 of which i considered to be bad tm, tes3, tes4, tess, 300 witcher 2  3, 15 years in wow. i was hyped for cyberpunk since 2012. the good  immersion the game is super immersive the city feels alive and real. i had to go to a police station the other day and on finding out that it is closed my brain told me to look for another entrance.  play the way you like wanna kill people? sure. pacifist? ok. stealth? cool. hacking? yes. melee? of course! ranged sniper? duh. muscle burly punching who prefers to just rip turrets out of the socket rather than bother with hacking? you do you dude. cyberpunk is free of deus ex curse for hacker characters. you absolutely can go through every fight with 20 points in intelligence i.e. hacking. the art of skill trees is strong in this game, but nowhere near as involved as poe. the skills are very diverse, and you never have to invest is passive stat increases.  respecting player's time  having done every side gig and discovered every marker on the map, i can tell you this game's narrative respects your time. no follow missions, not contrived stealth or checkbox tasks. side gigs are very optional, but can interweave with the main story line, giving you more dialogue options and additional ways to proceed with the story. finally, most missions have hidden objectives which i, being an idiot, missed.  romance options  judy is the best girl, waifu and too good for my v. romance is involved, feels natural and playful. it can be complicated or be a straightforward otp, depending on how you play. handled very well.  the story  v is not an entirely blank slate, more of a prepared canvass which is definitely my preferred hero type of playing rpgs. lukasz zawlocki's direction on motion capture is impeccable as is the voice acting. every long gig is memorable and delightful, every mystery worth investigating. the voice acting is solid throughout, even if keanu reeves definitely takes some time to get into the role so his would prob be the only voice acting that was hit and miss for me. also i never knew i needed a dead snarky rockerboy as a side kick, but here we are. the engine allows the game to switch between cinematics and gameplay flawlessly and the style makes even conversations with minor side gig characters beautiful and engaging. dunno if it was done by gameplay animation team lead by dmytro ishchenko or maciej pietras' cinematics team but hot damn it is impressive.  diversity  the city  finally, if this thing did not even have a quest line, half the price of this game is worth the admission to night city itself. hiroshi sakakibara and his team did a stellar job on crafting this gem. some of the weapons and one very particular hand gun, courtesy of kamil nowicki's art direction, look and feel amazing. everything about night city is great and technically groundbreaking.  the music  i am such a gonk i almost forgot music!!! p.t. adamczyk, marcin przybylowicz sorry dont have keyboard characters to spell your name and ofc paul leonardmorgan  my ears thank you. doing a mission with path of the rebel is a transcendental experience. the bad  character customisation could be much more  the ui  i can feel corpo hands around yaroslav getsevich's ui tech neck as he is forced to toil day and night on a ui that is nice for both consoles and pc  genera bugs  occasional tpose, graphics don't load sometimes. nothing gamebreaking on pc"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"cyberpunk 2077 in a matter of history and its depth is a work of art that is worth trying despite the bugs and some errors that can be perfectly solved in future updates, in terms of graphics the game has beautiful views and impressive quality, but there are errors which can ruin the game experience but as i said this has a solution and it is completely worth playing it .... if you are going to buy it, do it but not immediately wait for them to solve most of the problems and you will see what a work is of art"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"one of the best games, great story, great gameplay mecanics, many people dont recognize that because they want to be spoiled more and have many expectations."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"it's a great game, and also it's a victim of corporations because people with money push things so they can get their money. i knew what to expect coming from the witcher 3 and it's great, i've played at the same time with my friends and we share our experiences on discord and they are different , i see people say it didn't deliver the choices system but it did. in a world where big companies release the same game every year i think this is a different experience and it's nice. have patience for the bugs i think cd project red is an honorable company that will finish the game. you can just pretend it was delayed again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"yes .. we came to the end of another game with its pain and sweetness. if it comes to what i need to tell about the game, it is far below the effect it gives to the players ... anyway, let's talk about the positive things at first. the action pleasure in the game is amazing, i can say that it is a feature that can really lock the player, whether it is the music played in the conflict sequence or the atmosphere. the universe of the game is also well studied. night city is a dreamy environment. although the episode design and story start flat at first, it can attract the actor in the middle. besides, the variety in the game attracted my attention. there is nothing in the game ... you can do everything ... and let's get to the parts that upset us ... one of the biggest mistakes of cd projekt red was that they announced the game too early. seven years ago, all the actors gassed with a trailer. but it was under the gas that i was afraid of me anyway .. there is no such thing as optimized in the game and it is technically deprived. in every sequence of the game, every time you play, there are bugs and many more errors... as a result, if we say for today, cyberpunk 2077 is not a game that i can recommend from technical aspects and gameplay. but if any of you are curious about the story, there is a good story above average. get it, play it. or enjoy your torrenting xd but play it after 5 months. gameplay 610 graphics 710 voices 510 musics 710 atmosphere 810 story 610 characters 510 map  universe 910 my average 6.6  10"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i'm not sure where to start this comment. 2077 was supposed to be one of the greatest rpg games of all time. i think people have become disillusioned with the hype to such a degree that they cannot admit how bad the game truly is. let's go over the facts game in front of us right now, shall we. cdpr has intentionally lied about not only the technical performance of this game, ,but i would even argue the entire game itself is one big lie. their are three life paths and all three lead you to the same ending. before someone tells me that's not true, yes i do know side quests will alter some of the main story, however, its still not what was promised and i have to go outside of the main story to change v's progrssion? and even at that its still very shallow. most quests only change either minor things about the story or have cosmetic changes only. the ai are god awful and yes this falls under glitches bugs, but when the game is an open world rpg in name alone not in implementation it gets hard to ignore how lifeless the ai are. games like gta 5, red dead redemption 2, and the witcher 3 all have better ai than 2077. 2077 is a lifeless city. so much of the game has either been taken out, or is just sub par. you can't customize your apartment, the whole game is censored, lack luster customization compared to what was shown in 2018, lack luster shops, no transit system  you can find where the sub way station should be in the game, but they never designed it past that, can't get haircuts, can't eat food, no wall running, failed police ai once again the police do not behave as promised, and i could go on, and on about this game. and even excusing all of the failed promises the game is just very bare bones. why can't you do anything in this game besides missions that are all the same? where are all the epic gang and corporate wars? why do police not patrol the city? the game just is missing so many elements from previous rpgs. this part of my review is complete speculation as i don't have many facts to back it up, however, i speculate that 2077 the game never truly existed. all of the past footage was made up as a fake... much like anthem was. i think they have only truly been working on this game for a few years and not the 8 years that was claimed. this game needs another two years in development to fix all the bugs, broken promises, and now our broken relationship with cdpr. gaming officially has no good, trustworthy companies only money hungry corporations. excuse my grammar in this review rant, but i figure if 2077 can be a little buggy then why can't my writing be for this review. i give 2077 a 510 one of the worst rpgs i've played ever, glitches or no glitches"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"ok so i am playing cyberpunk on pc and its pretty good game its not a masterpiece at least in current condition but i am really enjoying it a lot. first of all the good parts   so the story is pretty good i really enjoyed it a lot and music was the best part of the game.  i really liked the art direction of night city as well it's most immersive city i haven ever seen in open world game.  all the side characters alongside v are very well writteni mean they are not generic everyone has different personalities and you can really get emotionally attached to some characters.  side missions are not repetitive each one gives you a whole new story and set of characters to explore and interact.  although there are certain tasks like clearing area for ncpd , or small gig'ssome gigs have story like side missionswhich can get repetitive but they're very useful for getting money so you can upgrade you're cyberware or buy weaponsclothescars etc.....  attributescyberwarelifepaths now this is where rpg elements comes in now you can choose what kind of  v  you want to be you can make a berserker build ,sneak build, hacker build etc.. depending on attributescyberware you choose or you can be little bit of all.  craftingupgrading weapons is available so you can also customizeupgrade you're weapons by adding modsscopes like basic stuff only.... now the bad stuff   lifepaths doesn't affect the story that much except first few hours.  bugsglitches.... the ones i am facing on pc are character going through solid surfaces like doors, walls, cars.... random npcenemy tposing , npc and cars spawning right in front of you , you're characters private parts popping out of clothesit can be fixed by unequippingre equipping themand some texture glitches.  npc ai is not that good no daynight routine or anything  no police chases they just spawn right in front of you when you commit a crime.   v  appearance can't be changed like getting new hairstyletattoos etc.. after character creation personally i don't care about the bad stuff that much but still i want them to fix bugsglitches at least."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,at first i'm not a cdpr fanboy. i was not waiti g for game. i trusted the cdpr. and they dont mess up. live this gam and waiting for mode content ! i dont wanna stop playing when fabular games end. to!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i was horrified seeing the crash videos that were going around. when i finally got my preorder, i was hesitant and to be honest underwhelmed. i played about 2 hours worth and visual glitches were quite noticeable. it felt like i was just playing the e3 demo, again very underwhelming. it wasn't the visuals that bothered me, but more of the flow of the game. it didn't draw me in and the dialogue was alot... i just didn't like it. there wasn't enough casual play for me, the game didn't feel immersive. maybe if the e3 demo wasn't the first 2 hours of the game? u ended up returning it, to be honest i think i was more excited about thw cool stuff coming with the collectors edition than the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"created world is just amazing, literally i'm soaking in it. that's fact game has bugs but none of them can affect action or my fun from playing. fabula is amazing, side quests is expanded and great also. and the music... one of the best i've ever heard in the game. i've waited so long for this game and i'm not disappointed at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"on the pc, the game is  overall  working as it should. i can not speak to the console versions for performance. that being that, cyberpunk 2077 is a hand crafted master piece with stories that will tug at your gut, make you wince and laugh out loud. gritty, dark and amazing. combine that with the great crafting system, hacking and driving, its aiming to be the best rpg open world game in a long time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,unplayable! too many bugs. if you have a console dont buy it. its just fraud. they didnt gave out consoleversions to the reviewers to hide their fraud and stated afterwards that they didnt knew that it was that bad wich is clearly a lie. f you for that cd project red.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,coming from pc and epic disappointment graphics are good controls are a bloody mess intro story is meaningless and short side missions are generic ai is what you expect from a scam game  the police literally spawns on you other road members wait until the end of time behind you when you stop on the road or park your car you can't pick up several items which are laying around no atmosphere in the open world this list could go on and on maybe this could become a good game in a year bot what botheres me most is how that could get released. media testers went on the hype train apparently and didn't think about what they expirienced when they tested this.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"no, the problem is not graphics glitch. the problem is much more serious. it is the gameplay and the 'open world' theme. npc, cars, cops all look like they have been scripted with ifelse statements. there is no ai. car, cops and nps all spawn and despawn behind your back. i mean, literally. are you in a crowded area? fire your gun and random npcs will all crouch with the exact same animation. then, you rotate 360 degree and boom! they are all gone. now magically cops will spawn right behind you. does not matter where you are. have you seen how the npcs walk? they look like zombies. i could not play the game past the first mission because somehow v's camera kept on shifting to his legs. it was so frustrating. i wasted my time even trying to play this game. this game is a scam."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i played this game blind. no trailers, no expectations, and it turned out well and very fun! the story is actually interesting, but not that deep. characters are fleshed out. gunplay an d driving is passable pure fps games like cod, and driving in gta games are still better cannot comment on ps4 nor xbox as i am playing on a beast pc. overall, its a fun game but and coukd be one of my favourite open world rpg"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"honestly, this game is truly ripped by all these criticism and the 'not so smooth launch', i get that.. i mean a first day patch that is nearly as big as the game and quiet some bugs here and there. but since i play it on an ssd and on a computer that is pretty alright i truly got barly any bugs anymore. there is also a solution for the problem that the game won't start loading into the game, just use the internet for something helpful remember the blooper videos for red dead redemtion 2? that was a buggy start as well, but nobody bats an eye... and i truly don't understand the comments about barly any content .. cause i feel somehow overwhelmed by it, i already have over 20 hours in it and i am really hooked by the story. for me it feels really interesting and new, like a mixture of a way better watch dogs, witcher 3 menus, gta gameplay feeling and fallout cynicism. i don't know how far y'all played or if you mixed up the ps4 version with the pc one.. but i honestly enjoy this game and the story... for me at least it feels like i am having big impact on it.... but how do i know i never reloaded my save to see if it changed when i choose something else but you always have the option, even in the middle of conversations. so to end this up, get over the buggy first hours gameplay and be open to this weird game and you may come to enjoy it aswell. the meme potential is also big on this one, thanks johnny."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,yes there are alot of bugs but most are not game breaking i still found the story one of the best story's i have ever played and all of the ending are emotional the bugs really don't take anything away from the story or game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game is impressive with it's ambition  theme. it's definetly fun to play. i respect that. however, the finished product is barebones, barely tested  full of bugs. so much features are plain, lackluster or subpar. the story is somewhat immersive, but shallow. characters and dialogues do not have a great depth, cyberpunk themes are lacking. cops spawn directly next to you when you commit a crime. collision has repeated problems. multiple display problems. you cannot change the scale of the minimap. you cannot change the colors of the hud. ai is simplistic and combat feels noninteractive, worst i've seen in aaa in years. few customization options. driving is a nightmare with mouse and keyboard. frustrating quest triggers. frequent ingame limitations. moreover, most storylines could take place in any universe with technology or magic. cyberpunk themes are underused, underdeveloped and often reduced to tropes. they sold us hype. we bought. they did not deliver up to their sales pitch. consumers are treated like beta testers again"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"everyone is complaining about the game beeing boring, cd project games are 90 story and 10 gameplay, so it was kinda called that we would have seen a lot of cutscenesdialogs and not a gtakind of game where you just bring chaos all around the world actually you can do it even in cp, but you are stopped by the level gap with enemies becouse... it's an rpg. bugs and glitches will always exist in any game, especially if they are open world, so this is another nonsense complain, since most of them can be fixed by save and loading the game, the only annoying one is the buck arnold fight where after you beat him and then kill he stay unconscius and you can't loot the money back 12k eddie lost, rip, but nothing gamebreaking. it's an awesome rpg game, but avoid the old gen version and buy it when you can afford a next gen console or a good pc, don't get wasted with the hype and use your brain."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,this is the best game in 20s and best soundtrack ever. if u dont have good pc do not play we dont care about your pc this is the best game

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"never preorder! no matter what.  buggy and glitchy in almost 60  70 of the playthrough  same dialogue path and options almost telltale style  lack of customizacion in characters and vehicles  npc ia is basically nonexistent  melee combat is very underworked  hacking system is very basic and almost unnecesary  driving with joystick is a nightmare you need a mouse and keyboard to make it playable  missing soundtracks and voice tracks in several points  crafting system is brokenuseless  economy system is broken  reputation system is useless  shooting system is average in comparison with other tittles  fast travel points are every two meters  stealth system is useless as also their two options kill or subdue, non of the options add any different point between each other making them the same conclusion the game doesn't worth the 60 dollars. yes the sound is amazing and the world they created is really good. but that's it. feel bad for the devs that they put their best to deliver a game that still need to be worked."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,it's a very nice game and people who says that is 010 or 110 just not play it or play it in ps4
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"horrible excuse for a rpg and even worse excuse of an open world game. the world is trash and didnt impress me at all. bugs and glitches everywhere. upgrading of your character in every way weapons, body mods, skill tree, all of it is lame. no new abilities or meaningful upgrades, just a bunch of .01 nonsense. story is hood, but you cant really change it much or impact the outcome meaningfully. you just play as v and not who you want. just trash"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"an amazing game. i haven't had such wow feeling from a game for a very long time. the story is captivating and i always had just one more quest in my head. side quests are also made with love and attention  ive enjoyed every side quest so far. and there so much to discover, to get to know the characters! the characters in this game have their life history... it's just interesting to see what's their past is, why they behave the way they do, what choices they made and how they past affects their life. the atmosphere and the city are vibrant and so satisfying. i can just drive around and enjoy the views and surroundings i never skip an npc driving me  i love to watch the city. sometimes what i see on the screen looks like a movie shot  so beautiful. there're sooo many details! in characters, in cars, cut scenes, city surroundings, quests, side quests, descriptions of the stories and items.... everything is on its place, so much love and attention was put in this game. i just can't get enough of it. it's 67 hours in the game and i still want more and more of it. such an amazing game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"campaign is a 910 yet the ending is such a let down after all the  you went trought... life path change the only first 30 minuts and allow different response during npc interaction, nothing else change. the entire intro is stitched and put together in an embarrassing montage. there are 50 side quest maybe 90 of them are all the same, steal data, protect npc,kill target. the one that really matters can be count on your hands. to many bugs and performance issue that can be fixed, this is not an issue. the main problem with the game are the core mechanics, starting from non existent ai, even on hardest difficulty, once you build your char in a proper way there is only 1 kind of mods that are worth looking for, crit  and crit damage, everything else is just there as filler, the entire gameplay break apart, the ai and enemys can't keep up with you anymore, and you just shred everything without any problem whatsoever. other than that, way to much cut content, you either progress the campaign, or do boring quest, you also have stupid ass world encounters, just there for farming xp and loot, they would be cool, if they were a little challenging, again, non existent ai completely broke and purpose of min maxing your stat. the game got 9 or 10 because the reviewer simply rushed the campaign, so they could be the first to release theyr  article, yet they forget to valuate the overall content of the game, leaving the review itself, only tied to a good campaign. if you want to spend 60 fore a 20h campaign filled with bugs and choices that doesn't matter, good for it, if you are looking for a deep rpg this is not the game for you. this game is the biggest let down of 2020, cdpr dropped the ball so low they need a 360 move and get theyr  toghether, fix the game, add content and stop counting the million of dollar they made, while crunching developers who just needed another year of delay. this company went from being praised by braindead famboys, to actually show itself for it's true nature."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game has its issues, but the overall experience is truly immersive. if you expected gta clone  that's not it  cyberpunk on pc is a mature rpg witch rich storytelling and well developed characters"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"money i wont get back. just because they're not a big aaa company this somehow gives them a free pass to lie to the consumer, watch they'll try to ride this out and collect the accolades for something. ignoring the broken buggy unoptimised mess this is, the game itself is a bland lifeless linear action game, a dumb shooter that asks you to murder everyone for no apparent reason. the marketing was literally dripping with hubris on the run up to this release, oh how the mighty have fallen. bonus the 90100 critic scores are beyond egregious, either they flat out lied to jump on the early views or they're hoping to curry favours within the industry with false ratings. once again journos showing how low they'll sink just to get noticed, vile scum."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,so many bug's in the game i can't even play the game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this cyberpunk 2077 is a scam, i can't add more than other users said before, if u didnt buy the game, dont do it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"cyberpunk 2077 is a microcosm of gaming's best and worst features. on one hand, you have the good. the story is interesting and original. the characters are well written and multifaceted. the world is vast and fun to explore. the combat is satisfying. the soundtrack is fitting, albeit the ads might be a little too wacky. the game is beautiful even on low settings, and the game never drags on. main story missions can have branches of them as side missions that can come back and effect the main story later on. there are plenty of little easter eggs and details in the world to find do you know how to use the 3 shells?. augmenting your body is fun and really helps the world feel like the cyber future. i have almost 40 hours played and i'm still in act 2. i haven't had this much fun exploring a game since yakuza 0. but of course, you can't discuss cyberpunk 2077 without the bad. the game is flat out, full stop, unfinished. i personally have not found or experienced any game breaking bugs, but i realize i've been lucky. late rendered textures, empty streets, cars disappearing. my character was glitched into a crouch once. i was bugged into a never ending heart attack twice. reported blue screens, poor framerates, and of course the console launch. the voice acting is hit or miss sometimes, with keanu showing why john wick and neo are his best roles. at one point they left in a filler voice line with a completely different woman in the middle of a speech section. there are no consequences for going on a rampage. you could slaughter 50 civilians, drive 300 feet, and police forgot you. there isn't much variety in the loot you can find, with only about 20 total guns in the game that i can tell. driving on mouse and keyboard is awful. idk if it's much better with a controller, but driving feels like every road is an ice sheet, and your brakes are mostly a suggestion. c77 was released 612 months too early. i see the vision, and i love everything that makes c77 what it is. every mission is interesting, every side mission is engaging. the story branches with your decisions, and given another solid year of development we would be discussing an instant classic video game. right now i see a 1010 game with 510 polish. 710 right now, but i am very interested in what this game looks like 5 months from now. do i suggest c77? yes, but understand you're getting a aaa game in what feels like a late beta. i love it for what it is, but i overlook a lot of small bugs. i can see past them, but to others they might be death by a thousand cuts. i would gladly lay down my life for panam palmer. thank you, cdpr for making me fall in love with a video game character."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"there are so much bugs, but history is very good and gameplay is very satisfying."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i love it, 80 hours in, deep and engaging. bugs are a minor concern, far exceeded by the positives."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"enjoyable story, interesting setting, amazing characters cyberpunk really has so much good stuff. a game that i am still thinking about days later. as long as you have reasonable expectations and don't expect any evolution from the open world formula witcher 3 established this game will not disappoint. it's not the evolution of open world games like some people began to believe but just another example at how good cdpr are at making open world games with engaging characters, settings and story's."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this might be my favourite or one of my favourite games ever made. its fantastic the storys pretty good but what makes it shine is the character development and the character development gets better in the side missions, the side missions are fun and addictive. the gunplay is like any normal fps so its nothing special but its nothing bad it handles well and feels fine. the movements very basic but gets you around. the cars are very detailed and feel nice to drive. the collectibles like the taro cards look cool and there are a lot of shards, like a lot. but the one thing that lets the game down is the bugs, the game is still playable but there are some glitches that either stop you from completing a quest completely or glitches that force you to restart the game, i understand that they had to release it now because no one would buy it if they delayed it again and yes its a great game but there are a lot of glitches, its good to see that they are trying theyre best to fix them but its just a little sad. but the game is still playable very playable. the thing that annoys me about most of the user reviews is that they post their review on the pc version but talk about the ps4 or xbox one version of the game which is just unfair, some people go to the different versions of the game to see which is best and you doing this is just scummy and a  move, so please dont do this. anyway besides that i would recommend this game in a heartbeat."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"abysmal. yes the game looks pretty, in some areas is pure eye candy. but its a very shallow experience, forgetting about the obvious bugs that will occur in any play session, there is so much lacking in the game, the city is boring, there is nothing to do, stores, bars, etc are just there there is nothing interesting, police spawns immediately by art of magic, all in all a very mediocre and below bar gameplay"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i gotta preface this by saying i was hyped af with this title since 2013. writing this review after i played a ton of the game, here are my two cents good  story is good, better than most of the games on market these days, which is great. cutscenes and are great, main characters are spot on.  graphics is great, especially when using rtx, which makes frame rate dip far below 60 in many scenes even on rtx 3080 that you barely can get anywhere these days. not so gooddissapointing  my main disappointment is that the open world is blank, empty etc. in terms of mechanics. nothing seems to have a substance or feel to it, everything is just there for you to look at, just mere appearance of a city.  game lacks content and variety, there are almost zero minigames, professions, factions etc. no car tuning, even no barber shop or tatoo shop, which is bizzare. rpg systems are weak, because there is no real transmog and not many options to finetune your experience or equipment outside of some not so interesting mods.  some minor things, like hud has no tranparency option, map in uniformative and all secondary missions no matter the type has exactly the same question mark icon etc. you cannot unfollow any mission for just freeroam, a reminder always stays in the screens right corner, unless you switch of hud in potions menu.  lots of readable lore with no real interest to dive into it.  outdated stealth, shooting, driving  gameplay in general.  no endgame or new game  , replayability also seems limited. really not that good  tons of bugs that break immersion. after fixing performance and bugs, i might as well give this game a 8  8.5, but it needs more major changes to be done in order to deliver what was initially promised. more content and many more gameplay systems need to be flashedout, then this may as well be a worthy gta contender in world of cyberpunk."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"in the game, the story is the most important thing for me. there are a lot of bugs that spoil the immersion a bit. but if you don't pay attention to them, then cyberpunk 2077 has a lot to offer. for me, it's still one of the best games of the year"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"all the bugs and technical issues aside ,you can see how incomplete this game is. i think the world has the best living open world i've ever seen but when they see that you're doing terrorist things such as killing npc etc.. there is no ai on them but other than that there is too much variety on the night city for possibilities such as become the boss of the best club of nc you can do that. quest design is so good that i loved it and the side quest design is best side quest design i've ever seen except rockstar games and w3 which is another game that made by cdpr i think the quest design is the best thing they do at game design. talked about the openworld ai ,the combat ai is no different than the openworld npc ai but combat is satisfying overall, the feeling of hitting someone with pistol is different than a shotgun. shotgun blows their head off but pistol would just kill. gun customization and upgrades are good enough to keep the game alive after 30 or 40 hours of gameplay and those mantis blades and katanas are soooooo satisfying that i just get the difficulty to easy to use them, they are so good at killing people. and the variety of combat is also good, stealth is good but bcuz of the ai they can spot you in a corner that cannot be seen in any circumstances which can be annoying but all in all combat is good. rpg this game is not an rpg game you play as v you talk as v you live as v. but you can customize your character your v can be different than my v but heshe is v not another person. however rpg elements are great in this game like the level scaling on enemies are perfectly balanced and you can get your character to the johnny silverhand level seriously you can do that all in all rpg elements are good. but i say don't buy this game right now because it is an unfinished game right now but 2 months later they said the bugs gonna be fixed some problems are going to be fixed. maybe the ai can be fixed by the patches who knows so don't buy the game right now. buy it 2 months later."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,haven't been this hooked on an rpg since skyrim came out. this is gta vs farcry. the many different ways you are given to approach combat encounters makes tbis very engaging. the immersion and graphics is excellent too.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the depth and detail of the city is amazing. the characters are rich and it's easy to get invested into them. the story is well written, and the missions are well designed. you run into the occasional glitch, but only enough for a chuckle, nothing game breaking, and the auto save is generous enough that it won't matter so much. vould depend on your  it on pc, avoid on console. it will only get better from here, very few games come out in a perfect state. i never kept up with the teasers, the 8 year development, and simply got it when it came out, and i wasn't disappointed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"tldr if you look at cyberpunk 2077 without the whole cdpr hypetrain marketing, it would have been a pretty good action rpg with a decent gameplay, superb written characters and a really good story, would rate it 710. the promises cdpr made are simply misleading, so many of those arent kept, therefor i cant give cyberpunk 2077 more than 410, even if i still really enjoyed it. cdpr promised us a futuristic world, where the player defines the way he wants to experience night city. your choices will slowly form your path to the biggest legend night citys ever seen or maybe something else? first things first, the story the story is good, but the character synchronization and the facial animations are just superb. after several hours in game you start to get attached to certain npcs, doesnt matter if its johnny or some other npc youll met on your journey. if youll talk to a friend you can see and hear in their voice when theyre scared, you can see their emotions, this is cyberpunk in its prime. the missions in general are well thought through and diversified. pathingdecision making most of the time youll pick a decision, just to find out in the next moment that it seemed like it wouldnt even matter what youve chosen. often dialog options are just different versions of yes or no and you cant really impact anything but just smaller events. of course there are these big moments where you have to decide how you would tackle a big job, but in the end the result is always the same, just the journey there vary result may vary also a bit e.g. if you decide to use option 1, character x dies at the end of the mission, if you use option 2 character z dies, etc.. its always that particularly sour taste after taking certain paths because it just feels too irrelevant to actually change anything. for mission pathing its a bit different, but also no revelation. if youre into melee combat, try breaching the front door and have some fun. love hacking? try to hack your way through enemy lines by deactivating their optics or distract them distracting works 95 of the time, so its basically your bread and butter on every spec tho prefer sneaky? skill into cool and move in and out again like a shadow without anyone noticing. everything plays a bit different but in the end its nothing too special. ofc. you can combine the above mentioned to mix it up a bit but wont change anything dramatically. character development the character creator is basic, you can pick different presets for certain parts eyes, nose, browns, hair, and so on, pick your first attribute points and start with a life path. there is no way to change your character afterwards no barber etc. at last pick your first attribute points, your origin and here you go. during your playtime youll lvl up and get new points to invest. the skill system is good and there are loads of interesting skills to choose from. your attributes will also let you make certain decisions e.g. you can only open a door if you have body 8, having int 6 gives an additional dialog 95 irrelevant crafting feels pretty underwhelming, tried it out once, never used again. gearcyberware armor is more or less just there, stats arent that impactful therefor my focus was looking good while beating my enemies to pulps. cyberware got me much more interested. after the trailers with those mantis blades i really wanted those. a ripperdoc visit later and after investing all my hard earned money, i went to town to   up. well, theyre pretty lame. not like theyll do no dmg, but having about 3 normal and 1 finisher attack animation simply doesnt make the cut especially when the finisher move takes about 3sec and you can still get shot in the meantime, complete disapointment btw the gorilla implants arent needed to open doors, simply put enough points into body and youre good to go the world night city and its surroundings arent too huge compared to a witcher3, but so rich in details that you can lose yourself just walking through the streets. your playground is big enough and versatile that i never used fast travel once during my 45hs. graphics i played on a gtx1080ti in 1440p, everything on highultra, just a few things lowered to medium and got a pretty solid performance 4050fps but vsync. bugs i had everything, most of the time just minor things, about 5 times game crashes or forced to reload. conclusion i really enjoyed the game but i cant silence the voice in the back of my head asking is this it, this is the great cyberpunk 2077 that weve been waiting for the past 8 years? this is the game cdpr sells us after setting the expectations so damn high? i cant feel but disappointed in this game and especially in cdpr marketing, this isnt the cyberpunk 2077 we were promised."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"this game has become the very thing it was supposed to destroy  a generic actionshooter. bugs i think i don't have to say much about this, because everybody knows at this point. this game is straight up not finished to the point were i had to start fresh on an early save because the game would always crash at a boss fight. to be fair, i'm playing on linux, but there are a lot of other bugs. graphics yes, the graphics are amazing if your pc is capable of running the game. but that's it, good graphics don't make a good game. story haven't played it through yet, but the beginning of the story is a mess. the different background you could choose are relatively irrelevant for the rest of the game and the montage was clearly meant to be playable and would've actually explained a lot about recurring characters. after playing the prologue i felt like i was thrown into a story i have no clue about, meeting people i don't know that are supposed to be my friends just to make them irrelevant in the next moment. i'm interested what's yet to come but after 6 hours of gameplay i still don't get my own motivations except for survival. mechanics this game is by no means a roleplaying game. yes, you have stats and perks that you can level, but you absolutely don't have to. you're just fine shooting your way through the levels. other rpgelements are straight up missing. different classes you could choose or factions to join  nope. at least something like heavy and light armor  nothing. the stealth mechanics are obligatory and simply what we've seen in games before. and even that is not thought out well. the sneaky takedown can only be done when you're precisely behind an enemy and the maneuver is the same animation over and over again. the hacking mechanics are straight up copied from watch dogs and besides that a repetitive buttonclick or unchallenging puzzle. gta online has better hacking minigames to be honest. that leaves me with three approaches to the game shooting, stealth and hacking, all of which are just an implementation of welltried but obligatory game mechanics without doing anything or in some cases doing the simplest things not even right. this also doesn't make the game more of a rpg, because you could just skill all three approaches more or less evenly and combine them all in combat without a particular up or downside to it. technically not much to say either, other than that the game is poorly optimized, the lastgen console versions barely run at all with nextgen console versions not even existing. on pc the community is trying to optimize the game's performance on it's one, but that was supposed to be the developers job in the first place. open world the open world looks great and appears vivid on first glance but upon exploring i couldn't find that many things of interest. the most buildings are not accessible, there are next to no stores or the stores you find are just decoration. npc just wander around aimlessly and the randomly occurring fights are always the same, therefore repetitive and quickly boring. i really don't know what to do in night city except for the main story missions or also repetitive side quests. how are there no dungeons or some paces you could enter, fight through, loot and whatnot? the open worlds unfortunately reminds me of watch dogs and not a bit of the elder scrolls or fallout. press i know it's common, but the game was over hyped from the press even before launch, but also after the disastrous launch the press keeps praising the game like it's some kind of a masterpiece. this game is not only buggy to it's core but even beyond fixing all bugs and optimizing the game it's mechanics are still mediocre and average at best. development i guess all core developers of the witcher 3 left after the blood  wine dlc so they hired new people, mismanaged and had to do the good ol' crunch. well, what possibly started as the fault of management has now to be paid by the players, that bought the unfinished game for full price. i doubt that the game can be fixed, patched and updated to live up to it's first expectations, but we'll see. conclusion the game started with huge promises and a big hype and actually launched to become a meme. everything i was hoping for isn't in the final game! it's not a fleshed out rpg like bethesda games, where you can skill your character to a very specific build combined with specific weapons, armor and gadgets, there's no exploring, looting and fighting through endless but always different dungeons. and it's not a huge open worlds as a rockstar game, as i'd hoped for to walk, run or fly through. with this elements missing or being below average all that's left is a more or less linear story and an firstperson actionshooter like we've seen a thousand time but this time in a different setting."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i really want to love it but it's just not what we were promised... lifepath so much emphasis was put on the importance of your lifepath choice nomad, corpo, or streetkid. but it becomes painfully obvious within the first 30 minutes of gameplay that the lifepath simply does not matter as you are all working on the same main story. besides a few additional special dialog options your lifepath has zero impact on the gameplay. this feature seems more like an afterthought than a primary selling point... quests the quests are good. i feel like there is enough content to keep most people occupied for at least 60 hours. the lore is detailed, you can read many little shards in game to find out more about the world. there are also plenty of eastereggs which give you a nice chuckle from time to time. world the world is large and detailed. the layout of night city mostly makes sense and it's an overall beautiful environment to play in. more on that later... gameplay ohhhh boy... here we go... the ai in this game is a complete and utter joke. the npcs don't have daily routines unless it means pacing back and forth sitting down on a bench from time to time. the cops show up out of nowhere and there is no wanted system besides wanted and not wanted. think gta star system, yea it definitely doesn't have that if you kill someone you'll be notified that the police have been alerted and then seconds later they spawn randomly outside your field of view. if you simply run away your wanted status just disappears. there are no long lasting repercussions to your actions in the world. other than your quest dialog options cops don't even drive cars, so there are also no police chases. the ais do not care if you steal from them. even in the witcher 3 this was a feature. you can't really customize anything beyond adding some mods which are not even visible on your weapon or armor and simply add some arbitrary stats to your item. besides a scope and a silencer... vehicles cannot be customized so it's a you can have it any color you like as long as it's black situation. day and night cycle has no impact on gameplay, neither does weather. there are no environmental hazards overall the game has no content outside of the questing system. there are no meaningful player  npc interactions and you never fully build a relationship with an npc. the game feels as wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle. as soon as you leave the narrow path that cdpr sends you on you realize the game is just empty. if you are expecting a beautiful futuristic gta v made by the creators of witcher 3 then stay away!!! far far away!!! because it's not that... i am having serious buyers remorse with this game... which is sad because it had so much potential."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"game with many bugs but is still playable on pc as least. story is good but expected better. such as the dialogue and choices to saydo different things feels useless and pointless. it carries no weight and it feels like it's there as filler content. it's quiet sad call of duty black ops cold war did better in that department . the story its self is quiet good but doesn't carry any emotion. the games combat is all weapon based and while the weapons are cool and unique, fighting isn't too exciting. the weapons just feel the same because of the friendly and enemy ai that performs worse that call of duty. seriously all they do is stand or duck behind cover and occasionally shoot. no getting flanked or getting pushed while your weak or the enemies running away if you throw a grenade. really disappointing. the graphics are quite good and detailed, this is only amplified by the artstyle which nails the 'cyberpunkfuturistic'. the city its self feels a bit lackluster. i thought i'd be able to have conversations with random npc's just for the sake of it but no, you can't. while there isn't much to do in the city, this is completely made up for in the huge number of side quests available. the game really shines in how you can customize you character and life. you can choose what clothing, flashy car and how to optimize your body to have futuristic gadgets which make you actually do side missions to gain the cash for these things. overall expected more but still a good game to play but only on pc or next gen consoles. it is unplayable due to bugs on ps4 pro, xbox one x you name it. lacking in the dialogue department. expected more from cd projeckt red. 7,510 even though metacritic doesn't do decimals"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"the game is very overhyped. the main story is very short, our choices have little influence on the story. driving cars is very bad. cars seems too big for the small streets. in the city i don't feel the traffic, because there are max 13 cars on the streets. the whole game has too much side quests, but not enough main quests. characters seems like they don't have emotions. npc's behavior is very simple, like in gta 3. they don't do anything instead of walking on the streets. i think the game is unfinished."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"one of the best games ever played. deep mix of cyberpunk, transhumanism, antiutopia with slight touch of philosophy. strong must to play for all fans of these things. storyline is brilliant and allows you not just to be a part of existing characters like in gta5, for example and doing what it is supposed to do by story makers but truly craft your personality by your actions and dialogs. besides, this is one of really few games where additional quests are really interesting and, if there is no direct sign that these quests are a part of main story and these are additional, it would be really hard to distinguish between them. and obviously most of them are not about doing some silly actions and collecting a bit of money  some additional tasks may even trigger additional endings. there is one huge disappointment main story is really short and it took me 2025 hours to finish it. let's say thanks to those who did not finish the witcher 3 and ruined the statistics which turned out to be a reason to shorten the main story of future games. there are also some minor flaws such as the physics of collisions or alien shadow hands for example, but come on! such detail are not this game about, this game is all about atmosphere. and atmosphere is outstanding  cd project red did enormous job to create this masterpiece. just applause. p.s. played it on ryzen 2600 and radeon 5700  full hd with all max settings with no issues. during the whole game roughly 2530 hours i experienced only 1 script bag which disappeared after last save reloading and 1 glitch solved by radeon driver upgrade. p.p.s for those who experience bugs on ps4 and xbox one  do you really expect flawless gaming experience of 2020 games on 7 years old console? i would not complain trying to play cyberpunk 2077 on something like core i53570 and 2 gb nvidia gtx670 with 4 gb ram onboard. just be realistic and be ready to invest in your gaming hobby by buying a new consoleupgrading your pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"one of the biggest gaming disappointments in recent years. apart from the obvious technical issues, the game is plagued by bad design choices. the formula is vastly different to what was promised or heavily implied through the carefuly crafted teasers, trailers and interviews. all the features that made it to the game are very shallow. for a long time the game was presented as an actual rpg. this is not an rpg game. it's an actionadventure game with some rpg combat mechanics. you get to pick perks, put attribute points, loot items and craft gear. but that's it when it comes to rpg. there is no rpg in terms of defining your character, who you are, no options to roleplay through the dialogue options in general conversations are very limited. the life paths are a joke, clearly cut out from the game to simplify it. i was expecting a game where i can enter a club or random shop and talk with some npcs just for the sake of... talking. no, nothing like that, the conversations are only there to push forward the story. no conversations like the ones in the outer worlds, mass effect, dragon age or even fallout games. there's also a big disparity between following the main story and doing side activities. in the main story game is very cinematic and the story is quite good, serious. but once you start doing side quests, it becomes a different game. very shallow looter shooter with tons of random battles. run in, kill enemies, loot tons of weapons and gear, move to the next point on the map. similar to farcry games. it's not an rpg, it's just a looter shooter with very basic rpg mechanics in terms of combat. the city feels dead, everything that was supposed to be interesting and exciting was cut out from game. this game is simply easy to forget. very disappointing. farcry 2077. i give it 510 rating. very average and forgetable game, and that is despite the technical issues."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"perfect game. cyberpunk 2077 is a very interesting experience. i'd like to preface this by saying that i'm a major fan of the cdpr from the witcher series, played all of them several times. they are all 1010s in their own rights, but cyberpunk 2077 is very different in some respects and also very similar"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"its the first game ive really enjoyed in a long  has flaws, but it's still become my favorite from the last few years."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,trash ps3 gen game mechanics with upscaled graphics and more bugs than even pumba could handle.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,terrible experience for a aaa game on pc. all the gamebreaking bug the missed features that cdpr lied about. it really feels like a early acces game on steam thats 10 bucks but not 60!!! it runs bad even on high end systems and looks like a 2018 game. nothing about the game make it stand out of the games released this year. wait a year before the bugs are fixed and when it is like 30
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"probably the biggest game scam ever? biggest overhyped failure for sure. lifeless world, npc's are dead. no interaction, clueless. life paths choice in the beginning of the game makes difference in first 1520 minutes of the game . no ai, especially cars, no random things to interact with. gta 4 that came out 12 years ago is miles away of this game considering npc's, ai and open world. it is a big lifeless world. you could deal with glitches, bugs and crashes but it is an empty game. it makes me sad that we didn't get what was promised. big disappointment"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i have currently spent around 30 hours in this world and i am totally engrossed. the world and the story feel absolutely believable and real. i already had multiple situations which made me question my approach to a mission or how i am playing. so far the story has absolutely gripped me. as someone who loved cyberpunk 2020 i feel like this game is one of the best adaptions of a ttrpg into a videogame. the world looks beautiful, even on medium settings and the stories that are simply told through the environment are en par with the witcher 3. i don't understand how people can call the decision making flat, or call it not an rpg. it has every element an rpg needs. just because it doesn't highlight it to you that your decision affected the story, doesn't mean the story is flat. i already had multiple encounters where my small decisions made a huge difference in the end. i acknowledge, that there are some issues with this game. but that doesn't make the game bad. i honestly didn't encounter nearly as many bugs as some people make it out to be. the only real immersion breaker is the police ai, but listening to cdpr this will be fixed soon. people forget how different the witcher 3 was before it received its updates. people only found it playable by update 1.10 after launch and still call it a masterpiece today. i'm certain cdpr will fix its little kinks to let the true game behind them shine and let everyone experience this incredible story."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"first of all, it is about the pc version of cp2077. ok. how do i assess a game like this? it all depends on the context. my experiences as an experienced gamer will be totally different than the experiences of a new lad who hasn't seen many big titles. the new lad will not compare. imagine that you start playing the game without any expectations or watching the marketing stuff... your perception would be totally different. i believe that trailers or opinions of others before you taste something will ruin your very own experience. however, the gaming industry just like the movie industry needs marketing to sell the product and make money. think , a gta fan, who was waiting for cp2077 long and was living the hype. his rig is from a lowmedium range. then he buys the game on a day one and bang! 2030 fps and you can't shoot people from the window while driving. moreover, the badges are not spawning as nice as in gta. what a disaster! so what do i think about the game? let me compare, lol i am recently playing rdr2. no bugs, or graphical artefacts, outstanding graphics, nice npc ai, flowless gaming. i love that game. yet, on a friday night after 3 beers, i will switch it to quake champions or start watching youtube because it becomes boring after a while. how does my friday night look with cp2077? last friday i emptied all my cans and was still playing the game till 4.00 am. my saturday and sunday looked the same except the drinking. i literally couldn't stop playing... it is so addictive. when you drive a car and listen to a metal radio station you can feel a bit like in the gta but when you are on foot in a shooting... well that's exciting. the colours and horizontalvertical complexity of the city made my eye explode. i could not go from one point to another without watching everything. the game reminds me  hybrid. the fpp while on the street and in buildings was a very good choice because you can feel like more in the game, more real. you enjoy and appreciate the world and the npcs outfits. is the cp2077 engine flowless? no, it's not. did i have to tweak my rig to get a few more fps? yes, i had poor console fellas. there are some bugs. some things could be improved or changed. the npcs ai is not great and i can't kill people with twopunches, and the police . however, those issues could not spoil my fun or change my opinion of the game. right now, i would love to leave everything and start playing. did i have this with rdr2, gtav, skyrim sorry my old friend, i was getting bored in the dungeons and any other gib games? no, with only one exception. the witcher 3. we are coming to a conclusion. it's all about an interesting story and adultmature feeling of the game. that's why i rate cp2077 1010. imagine ridley scott making the alien and reducing the age to 14 to sell more tickets in theatres. what kind of alien would we got  all the crew would be in their 20s showing their brilliantwhite teeth d nevertheless, i hope they fix the issues and let the other to have a great firsttime experience in the nearest future. game creators had a vision when they were making that game. i can feel it. have they delivered? i will leave the judgement to you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"are you joking me? fix the game and then im gonna playing it. im done. even my strong computer and ultra graphics dont overshadow the number of pc bugs, glitches, and no ai on every npc, cops, everything. its just a joke and i will play it when it go out of alpha"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"il gioco  valido stiamo pur sempre parlando della cd projekt ma ha moltitroppi problemi attualmente.....  il sistema di personalizzazione  molto limitato  tendenzialmente sono un amante degli stealth, qui le meccaniche sono tutte da rivedere  i bug non sono l'unico problema pare che il gioco sia stato finito in fretta, la mappa  piena di edifici vuoti o zone in qui si pu cadere nella mappa,  i cali di fps sono eccessivi graficamente  uno spettacolo ma se con una rx 590 da 8gb sono costretto a giocare a 1080p tutto settato a low e sto tra i 4555 fps fino a cali di 3025 non  colpa della scheda video e semplicemente ottimizzato male, non tutti si posso permettere una 3080  la stragrande maggior parte di quello che  stato fatto vedere nei trailer non  stato mantenuto o  stato semplificato eccessivamente  le opzioni di dialogo sono molte di pi ad esempio di the witcher 3 ma, sono buggate anche quelle spesso il  inizia a mischiare le battute e a sovrapporle fino a rimanere bloccato ed a ripetere tutto da capo.  le meccaniche generali del gameplay sono cose viste e riviste in tantissimi giochi usciti da quando  stato annunciato 2012 ad oggi non hanno creato nulla di davvero originale. sembra un mix di deus ex  gta v consiglio non compratelo, almeno non adesso e nemmeno nei prossimi mesi aspettate i primi dlc che in teoria dovrebbero uscire quando sistemeranno tutto magari aggiungeranno pure qualche meccanica nuova ed innovativa, penso che tra un'anno sar un gioco completamente diverso.. spero"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i'm loving the game so far, been roaming the streets and back alleys at night doing the millions of sidequestsevents. there are so many details in completely random places like drug deals gone wrong or corrupted cops getting murdered. i had no expectations for the game when i bought it so there were no disappointments, i just play and have tons of fun. i have an old gaming laptop and even that can run this on 1080p mediumhigh, only one ctd after 44 hours of play. one thing  though the driving is worse than in any major title in a decade, they really need to fix that. but i'm sure they will."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i'm having great time with the game. some bugs here and there but nothing too big, that would ruin my fun. not sure about some gameplay choices but over all it's great! thanks cdpr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i bought this game because i'm an old fan of cyberpunk 2020. i cannot believe there was a star like johnny silverhand in the game! i read enthusiastic reviews, i thought it was the game of the year. it will change the videogames world forever. i don't know how much money took who wrote reviews like that, i can only say that every expectation was completely disappointed. the very first thing that come in my mind is boring. this game is really boring, it's not an rpg, you have no really choices, it's all set in a onewayonly. the dialogues have poor choices, if any. everything is so flat you cannot believe it's a 2020 game. the weapons are probably one of the most disappointing stuff of 2077 they're just aesthetics and numbers. a knife can do more damage than an heavy machine gun. the aiming system it's almost the same for any weapon, the optics just magnify a little, the recoil it's the same. if you play fps you will be extremely disappointed. the only thing that really matters about clothes numbers. so you can wear underwear with snow boots, because you find them with higher statistics, and you really need their armor points in order to survive. cars? just for your private collection, and for some rep points. i never saw such a bad drive system. you can teleport yourself from one part of the city to another with blue points, so don't waste your time and money with vehicles. there isn't even traffic ai. can you believe that? in a game of 2020.. motorcycles? undriveable like cars. npcs? no ai. cops are spawned behind you, without even arriving on crime scenes with cars, av, whatever. buoldings? you can explore 23 floors max. in a . it's ok, but don't sell me this game as an open world with infinite possibilities. it's not. interactions with npcs on the street? close to zero. just a bunch of replies, repeated endlessly. the endgame no, it's not a spoiler it's built on forced choices, really bad written. interaction? you spend an important part of the game as passive observer of infinite dialogues and pauses, which no one feels the need. sex? it's one of the most ridiculous and false propaganda of cdpr. it's few seconds of boring scenes that has really little to do with their advertisement. romance? it feels like playing a game of ten years ago. end of review. i don't want to bore the reader, the game is already doing that. completely waste of money and time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"except that it is very demanding in terms of hardware power, i really enjoy this game... and my sleep time suffers from that a lot p i really like all the way npc reacts when they talk, this technology is amazing, such good talks with them. the fact that you can climb or even jsut stay and see the crowd in front of you... so realist, one of the best. bugs ? honnestly the only 2 bugs i'm facing are you cannot remap the z key for opening shard or view message while you can do for moving forward. so with an azerty keyboard when you move forward you open acquired shard or new messages.  switch to qwerty keyboard and no more problem. second bug is sometimes one speech line of johnny stay on the screen adn so in talks with npc it make the whole thing messier. oh and once a coffee machine flying because the table below was not displayed what's missing ? to be able to sit on bars and restaurant and spend time like that, flirt with random people, and more toyjoy than the only 2. oh and yes your start defines lot of changes depending if you where from badland, street or corpo. more than you think even if it's subbtle."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"i've been playing cyberpunk on xsx and i am having a blast. about the bugs, yes there are some, but it's just like in any other game of that type at launch. a few visual ones here ant there, maybe quest not triggered for me twice and i had to reload save, that's all. nothing really game or immersion breaking like people say. to put it into a context fallout 4 at launch was much worse for me. and i am not speaking about just visual bugs but game crashesh and performance related stuff that actually stopped me from playing. but i guess if bethesda or any other well known developer releases bugged game it's ok, because we expect that. why expect excelence from red and let other slip ? that is just not fair. especially considering fact that cyberpunk is brand new ip, not yet another part of brand well established. we all know those games that are being released each year and we are so used to them that we are not even surpised if there any bugs or gamne mechanics that wasn't fixed for years. what is important is that bugs will be fixed and what we are left with is probably the most impresive open world game i have ever seen. i am not speaking red dead redemption grass fields and forest impressive. i am speaking city so dense, so complex, so rich in detail that it could be used in next 10 cods or split into a few assassins. night city designs is just mind boggling. streetsm buildings, highways, alleys, levels on top of levels and all that covered by shades of enormous  towering over the city. and none on them looking copy paste. each alley could be a seperate level in any given aaa shooter. atention to details is just insane. all that is served in most beautifull lighting system i have ever seen. just the visual aspect of cyberpunk deserves high score. but we are also getting really solid action rpg. with good storyline, well acted characters and great dialogues. animations is what really sells them. there is enough statskillinventory menagment to satisfy any rpg fan. crafting, upgreading items, weapon mods, implants, all there. and the part i feared the most, shooting. it is really fun, good shooter fun actually. i am surprised how well cdpred pulled that of knowing that they have zero experience with shooters. to crown it all, great music and sound, really setting the mood. if you are akira, ghost in the shell, bladerunner fan this game is must have for you. its is like those worlds brought to life. this is easily on of the best open world game ever made and solid very action rpg. any reviews saying otherewise are either written by people who never played it or other games or just pure hatred. in my opinion it deserves solid 9. but i amd giving it a 10 because how the world design and scale impacted me and to counterbalance all those hate zero scores that are just rubbish."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"pros  great story, interesting characters, decent gunplay with great amount of totally different guns, increadible graphics and music. cons  ai of random npcs on streets is quite bad but i don't really care as ai of baddies in combat isn't, some glitches but no gamebreaking bugs so far overall experience  i love every single minute of this game"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"game works perfectly as linear story, which was lovely. i have a problem with poorly designed systems which have been implemented to this game, and are working as a part of san box openworld experience. i also have problem with romance system. i expected an improvement comparing to witcher 3 in that matter, but got even less 20 seconds sex scene in a tank as a reward  rly?  make our partner our companion, implement some actions we can do with them to feel immersion and that this person truly supports our v even after scripted questline. it feels like cdpr put too much effort into trying to keep this game pretty and big, without making in game systems big and fun to play. cyberpunk in current state would have worked fine as linear rpg, sadly , and to be honest."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,reviewers that get paid to give it a perfect score even when they said the game is flawed and buggy should be excluded permanently because of highly unreliable or biased!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"what is this joke? no seriously, this game has been in the oven for almost 9 years, and came out half baked. this game makes watch dogs legion look like a masterpiece. this game is filled with bugs, and most of the features don't even work, at first, i didn't want to buy this game, but the expensive marketing tricked me into buying it.i regret it, i probably should've cracked it. they even got keanu into this just to convince you into buying this game. let's state some of the biggest problems. the game introduces characters that v already knows, but doesn't give any background, they are just shoved down our throat. no driving ai, npcs follow pre determined paths, if you stop in the middle of the street all the cars will just stop and stay like this untill you move.that's there are no car chases with the police. cmon cd projekt, even gta3 had this, and it came out almost 20 years ago. soulless npcs, they walk around in a pre determined path until they despawn. you cant even interact with them, and if you press e they will just say something like  off or i don't have time for this like gta 5. what the  cd projekt? even oblivion had better conversations with npcs. i can't be mad with gta, they really didn't promote the interactions with npcs. the best clothes will make you look like a clown. i literally just found a pair of pink shorts that have 80 of armor. pathetic ai,cops spawning behind you whenever you dare to touch an npc. character progression  basically you dont need any upgrades or because most of the time you can't tell the difference,you don't get new abilities beside hacking which is medicore at best. only few of the choices actually have impact on the story, most of the times they are just here to make the game longer. although the graphics are good, the lightning is pretty bad and also it runs terribly on old gen. lifeless city, you can't interact with anything or anyone. the driving feels sooo bad, and you will find yourself driving around this lifeless city for a big chunk of the game. no ragdoll for the player, for example, when you get ran over there's just a pre made animation. so basically, this game is just a futuristic borderlands. they could've done so much better if they didn't spend so much time in marketing and making jokes on twitter. and they want to put multiplayer and microtransactions into this mess? aha, that's funny. but let's be real, even if they fixed the bugs, this game would still be mediocre. please internet historian or crowbcat, make a video on this, and spread the voice."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,deciced to subscribe and buy stadia and controller for this game. it's awesome! but i'm playing on stadia.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"definitely not what was promised overall. that being said, the game is incredible. the world is immersive, the graphics are astonishing. seriously, the environment artists carry this game on their backs. the story missions are fun but feel very linear. the side quests open a bit more variety but still very rigid. they game plays best as an open world actionadventure game rather than a full rpg. i'm in love with the game. the characters are truly wonderful, going through the story with these people and seeing how they evolve over your short time in night city is truly incredible. i wish romances were a bit more than just a sex scene for the most part, but that's not too big of a deal. the combat is a little better than good. guns feel responsive and punchy, but recoil feels a little inconsistent. swords are just fun to build out and go crazy with and the body augments add a special flair to the game although i wish they were more integrated into combat rather than just a separate dedicated weapon. driving is honestly a bit annoying. cars don't feel like they're on the road, it's like you're always on a layer of ice or oil and you just can't get the car where you want it unless you go really slow. overall the gameplay experience is enjoyable, it misses any revolution to the genre but does everything i'd expect as well as it can given the bugs. the game has consumed over 50 hours of my life in just a week. that being said, if you don't have a good pc, a strong desire to immerse yourself in the dense streets of the future, or a want to play a more rigid rpg experience, then waiting might be best for you. the game has a lot of flaws and bugs and missed promises and that's gonna be hard for a lot of people to overlook. i was one of the lucky ones who was perfectly targeted for this game and had a good enough pc to play it well. this will be a classic if and when cdpr gives it the polish needed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-17,"visually impressive on high end hardware, story and characters are enjoyable. cutmissing features comparable to no man's sky, riddled with both annoying and sometimes gamebreaking bugs, poor performance on even cutting edge hardware, poor implementation of dlss, distracting mesh pop in even on max settings, pedestrian ai decades below contemporary counterparts that's rivalled by bt ai i wrote for a one semester university project. nigh city feels like a beautiful painting, not a livedin, interactable place. npcs path, react and behave unnaturally, 99 of places are closed off and many that are not are empty of player interactions. gunplay and driving control is poor, and the hacking gameplay, while initially interesting, is surface level and lackluster compared to what was promised a trend in all aspects of this game. here's hoping that the revitalization of this game will be as comparable to no man's sky as its launch as been."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"while the gameplay felt alright when it was working, and the main story was intriguing and well acted the rest of the game falls very short. everything outside of the main quest feels shallow and incomplete, from lifepaths having an effect on the story to interacting with the open world. so much of the game feels cut or scrapped to save time. even if they fix all of the bugs in the game i would not feel the need to play it again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"once again, the old rule holds true the more hype, the worse the final product will be. this is an absolute travesty . empty, dead world with absolutely nothing to do. the scum that made this game didn't learn any of the lessons of open world games of the past 20 years. it's comically bad. it would be funny and all if the scum that works at cdpr were not making money off dumb console players that are too ignorant to know they're being scammed. god i hate capitalism and to all people involved in this project, you are literally the bane of humanity and you are all that is wrong with pure profitdriven game development. consider yourself spat upon, cdpr. i'll make a point to badmouth your company to everyone who'll listen and i'll pirate all your products and distribute them as far and wide as i can just to try and prevent you from making undeserved profits. please don't buy this product. it's literally terrible. gta 4 is a masterpiece by comparison and that wasn't all that good to begin with."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,its beautiful game.  bugs. i can live with them. the main story is great and the graphics... omg
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,in one word overhyped and there's nothing revolutionary except maybe graphics with rtx on.after 8 long years they gave people this buggy mess. they should have spent another 8 years on this  can not even cut your hair or shave in this game and cdpr talks about this game having deep customizations.honestly really disapppointed with the side quests also except maybe some story related ones.i liked witcher 3 because of it's side story and witcher contracts which felt more like main stories rather than something you complete in order to grind for xp and those quests also dealt with human emotions and moral dilemmas but with cyberpunk 2077 every other side gigs which are not story related felt really straightforward it's either kill or retrieve or steal or rescue and so on and felt like i was just grinding and grinding which is unlike my experience on witcher 3 which made me want to play more side quests and witcher contracts.main story is worth it but they should not have advertised it as an open world game when the open world is just plain empty.cdpr lost my trust.they overpromised and underdelivered .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,most people upset because of bugs. they saying it's unplayable but i didin't see those unplayable bugs. i only see the graphical ones like npc's and car's passing through the walls. i think people too hyped before the game release. i didn't hyped at all. like the original watch dogs people hyped and not loved the game but i didn't and still playing it sometimes.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"it's hard to judge the game that has been waiting so long the expectations and promises we made in our heads collided with what has been served to us recently. we fell victim to our own imaginary expectations, fed with an unnecessary mass media. if not too much is known about this game after the premiere, probably everyone would be delighted. the fact is that there are errors, glitches, shortcomings. which game doesn't have them. i don't look at ps4 and don't judge other versions because i'm playing pc. i think it's a great game with a great storyline. you can only play the storyline and you'll have a great time, and you can also catch every marker on the map and it'll be great too. it is true that i do not like opponents who swallow lead like a drug hypochondriac and the points flying out of them, but the world in which this happens eliminates this experience, giving me great fun in the cyberpunk universe."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the game has lots of glitches in it, and the 2 most damning game breaking ones are weapons being unusable, and vehicles being undriveable! the stealth mechanics in cyberpunk 2077 are complete garbage! there is no smashing out walls after eliminating who can hear you, and sneaking around in ventilation ducts like the newer deus ex games human revolution, mankind divided, the fall in order of goodness! the gameplay makes me really miss deus ex! there is nothing quite as satisfying as a stealth ambush that nobody saw coming their way! i love sneaking around, and then picking off a bunch of targets from the perfect vantage point! i'd rather work for david sarif, than be v! i am a david sarif loyalist! i love sarif industries way more! the stealth mechanics are no better than the ones found in perfect dark on the n64! also i don't believe cloaking is a thing in cyberpunk 2077, and where is the typhoon blast system? car combat in cyberpunk 2077 is practically non existent! even redline gang warfare 2066 a 1999 pc exclusive game has it figured out better for a single player game! coop could also solve this problem too, but driving mainly exists to get from mission to mission which is extremely lame! cdpr please go play the olde console exclusive game called roadkill! ripperdocs only give you a menu for upgrades, and never actually do any surgery! car upgrades are not a thing in cyberpunk 2077, and cdpr should have played gran turismo, and every game that copies it's formula, with my favorite being flatout 2 which plays a lot like the olde midway rush games! i only love arcade racing games, and really hate simulators, and only brought up gran turismo because that is the game that seriously started the vehicle upgrade trend in racing games with way more options than road rash 3 or some of the older racing games look at that game's vehicle count! i love upgrading my vehicles as a reward, and it also makes racing games far more immersive! you can't use the boats in the game, or fly! the character creator is nowhere near as good as the one used in the saints row game series! all you get are presets with no fine tuning adjustments like the saints row games have! also the ending of the game is disappointing when you decide to be sent back to earth, because there is no fmv to show this!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,it's a futuristic game where the gameplay is very fun. the plot is addictive. it was a great experience to see the future in a different way.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"first, it turned out i find the whole cyberpunk aesthetics cheap. it is plain simply ugly for me that's why i can't value its graphics it doesn't matter what rtx it has, it is just ugly. cheap and ugly. a kitsch. i couldn't find a single positive thing with this game, lots of negatives though  as i said i don't like cyberpunk aesthetics to be any appealing, so the graphics will look ugly for me no matter the tech used.  the interface is seriously overburdened. too much info, i can't even get message i am reading. just too much info on the screen.  everything is too flashy. this makes already subpar design even worse.  city design. blocksblocksblocks. everything is too tight so there's no real open world. it is technically but it is wasted by the design team.  cars are utter crap. i like driving and the good driving is challenging one, in a predictable way, which means driving should be close to the reality. the driving here is a big time  and, of course, the map itself is not really suitable for it, i see no place where i would like to ride in.  fps mechanics for shooting without the most satisfactory mechanic of it headshots. just no fun shooting here. then why so much shooting if they can't make it right?  and, i didn't expect this after their witchers the story. i start playing for some piece of flesh with gadgets i give a flying heck about. a bland game partner, jackie, i couldn't care less too. useless piece of trash i can't even rely on in numerous ty fights. then need to save some robot girl for some unknown reason. the story is off. i mean off. it is totally clueless. no idea what is happening here, what are motives and what are purposes.  no sense of immersion i had with both witcher 2 and 3. i tried to get it so can't refund the game more than 15 minutes. but the lesson is learned will not buy dlcs. ps it is the shame they wasted their time on such a poorly thought out thing instead of adding dlcs and small missions in witcher 3. i tried to play it but exit after jus"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"if you just stick to handcrafted missionsmain or side, the game is pretty fun. a solid 710. just as in withcer series it is the stories and characters that stand out. other game mechanics such as combat, loot and crafting system, etc are all very mediocre howeveragain just as in witcher. but i cannot in good conscience give this game a 710. even if you look the other way on the complete fiasco with console version of the game, cdpr's marketing has been nothing short of fraudulent. there are so many things big and small which indicate that a huge portion of the game has been cut out at the last minute, and as the result anything outside of the main quests are conspicuously halfassed and unpolished."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,i know there is alot of bugs on low end pcs and some on top tier ones. i had some bugs but man the game is so beautiful. the amazing story telling. the brilliant side quest. every corner in this game is filled with love. all we love about the witcher games is all there. please give the game a chance to heal from that bad launch. we all know that cdpr will fix it it's just a matter of time . it's so heartbreaking to see all these zeros please be fair.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,actually this game is not that bad but cdpr are really doing trash things. cdpr are not even decent company. i heard that they are deceiving people by false refund information and people who purchased cyberpunk 2077 on playstation or xbox are really disappointed. they also tried to hide their problems on game and tried to fix reviews. it is really deceptive and bad. i am shocked while they delayed to release this game three times they didn't fix any bugs. the real game was too different from the trailer. i expected very great game experience but this ain't even be close to skyrim which was released almost 10 years ago. cyberpunk 2077 will be remembered as what other game companies should not follow. i still can not stand big false advertisement. i will get a refund in gog for sure.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,not really what i was expecting but im playing it anyways. layout and all are really just thrown together. its a mix of batman arkham knight and saints row and thats not really a good thing.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,yes the game have bugs but nothing to major to take away from this amazing game. only minor bugs like people and cars disappearing for me with items being invisible bit what does that realy mean when your playing one of the best story line games of the year. i have played on the normal xbox and it is iffy with low res and freezes witch is bad and i would say that it is bad to play but putting past that still a good game. with the patches coming in i see no reason to not play the hame
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the game is the biggest spit in the face to gamers since fallout 4. the dialogue system is regressive and has set back rpg's for the next 5 years. the graphics are laughable for a game that came out a week ago that is supposed to be the cuttingedge of video games. nothing about this game is worth praising and everything else about it is a complete middle finger to the gaming community as a whole. combat is worse than most ps2 games i have played. hacking is almost pointless and takes far too long. visuals are  the only game you have ever played is superman 64. other than that it very underwhelming. the game feels very linear and i don't feel as if the choices i am given really make any difference. laziest writing i have ever seen in a game in my life. its completely lazy to give me the choice to choose half of my dialogue but most of how dialogue is engaged is via a question. seriously that's the best you can do? questions? i don't even get to choose all of my dialogue, plus what i choose isn't even what i say. it's more of just the gist of what your character will actually say. but to engage in dialogue the npc's have to ask a question half the time is just lazy and just shows what a true  company these game developers really are. they don't explain  in this game and pretty much leave it to you to figure out how to play most of the game. so yeah i give this game a 0 because all my gripes with this game will never be fixed and you can quote me on that. sure they can fix glitches and bugs, but to advertise how custom you can make your character but i'm stuck with literally the same name and voice for every character you make. yes you get a different voice based on choose male or female, but that is the bare minimum if you ask me of what they could do. having a voiced protagonist takes away so much of the emersion of the game is sickening that anyone thinks it is ok. you are literally gaming cancer and should be ridiculed as such. when they are done fixing the game it will still be an underwhelming game that falls short on nearly every level and will truly be look back on as one of the key moments to how an era of  games came about."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this was pulled from my steam review which i edited a bit for professionalism and such. so here goes the law system in this game is completely brokenand or missing, cops don't chase you, and quite literally appear out of nowhere sometimes within eyesight. they have two modes, 1 star in which you can escape the doughnut boys on foot or 4 stars which is 1 hit kill. the perk system is cool and this is where it becomes apparent that the game is truly trying to be an rpg, one of it's upsides for sure. in fact certain mechanics are locked behind these perks which is a good idea for the purposes of really making you choose your play style. levelgating is kinda ehhhh, i don't mind skill checks if they serve a purpose however bullet sponge enemies are not so in for good reason. it does somewhat make sense in the context of cyberpunks with reinforced skinarmor etc. but yeah this needs a revisit. crafting system and loot system is kinda your typical looter shooter, keep stuff, throw it away once you get something better, maybe utilize the pretty generic crafting system. this isn't a huge problem so to speak but doesn't evolve much beyond what we have seen before on a pretty basic lootcraft system mechanic. the traffic and pedestrians in this game is just embarrassing. vehicles and people will change literally if if you do a 180 spin. people and vehicles spawn in often right within eyesight. they have some weird fake draw distance thing going on where you'll often see cars in the distance but not in front of you. this is especially cringe when you are in the badlands. not much in the way of tutorials which i don't personally mind but some people might initially be a little confused on their first steps outside of the main plotstory. ahhh yeah the branching story line? a joke, things coalesce pretty quickly. not say it's not a good story, just not what was promised. the corpo role specifically is a bit of a joke since you don't actually do much for corpos, introducing v as former corpo for that role could handwave that i suppose. i fully went into this hoping i'd be able to do some shady  but i kinda realized something was up closer to launch when it was apparent your story was closely connected to the same characters, of which many are interesting and well written. the voice acting is top notch. there are however a lot of improper audio cues that can take you the hell out of it pretty quick, while the story is great and all i literally can't go 5 damn minutes without seeing glitches, clipping, or some immersion breaking nonsense. the gunplay is fun and the guns themselves feel proper and powerful. you can meta around a bit if you feel so inclined, but unless you turn the difficulty up you'll probably mow through stuff anyways i also took notice on the menuui for crafting that the bottom middle circuit part that corresponds with skills normally greys when you hover over it. not a huge deal but this is one of the things that make you go, why? what is this? placeholder for something else you shouldn't put these front and center if it is the case? a skill that didn't get worked into the game? something broken? cut content most likely? the graphics performance is just atrocious compared to some of the stuff i've played recently. pop in, cars that transform when you do a 360, hell sometimes they'll change right before your eyes. often times you can see the spawn in points for pedestrians and cars. it looks really really bad. compared that to say rd2 you look off into the distance and see something, chances are it'll still be there when you arrive. what are some good things? well the game does look good when turned up and i envy people who are people to play this with rtx. the story is solid and character building is what you would expect of cdpr. the soundtrack is also an absolute banger so huge props on that. it doesn't take anymore than a simple google search to see that cdpr is on record, and not through some word of mouf bs, i'm talking literally video interviews etc. discussing mechanics and such that would in the game. there is an abundant record of evidence that cd did not deliver with their promises on this game. it also clear they lied about the state of last gen, which will naturally hold up progress on addressing the above issues and yes for us pc players too. in addition to this, while you can generally actually play the game, your experience will be riddled with bugs, glitches, performance issues and problems that will effect your experience. bold statement but this is easily top 5 botched launches this decade. if you told me this was the same devs as the witcher 3 i would've declared you a damned liar. tldr good story, world, soundtrack, graphics, nailing the basics, big reductions for failure to implement promised features, non stop bugs, poor performance, and an extremely deceitful marketing campaign"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the devs really did overhype their own game. showing unrealistic ambitious trailers. fooling 8milion preorders... myself included, this was my most anticipated title like many of you. this isn't a bad game at all, it just is unfinished.. it needed another year at least to iron out the gameplay systems and optimisation.. here's my review. graphics 810 shockingly bad on anything lower than ps5xsx. stunning on pc with rtxhdr on.. although not perfect, parts of the city seem unfinished with low textures, visual glitches etc.. story 810 short but fairly enjoyable, many likeable and interesting characters throughout, although i never really felt consiquences for my choices likea true rpg... gameplay 710 playing on very hard from the beginning, the game does a terrible job at scaling enemies, no matter how much health or armor i get, i would still get one shot quite frequently, enemy ai is absolutely terrible in most fights, from downright overpowered to completely oblivious to me standing infront of them. the police ai is completely broken, if you commit a crime they spawn in ontop you lol.. combat 710 i've tried most of the weapon types in the game, smart weapons are cool but feel like some cheap aimbot, shotguns just end up getting me one shot because of terrible ai scaling on very hard.. melee and blunt weapons much the same issues as shotgun, mantis blade is fun at first, but feels extremely janky. my build ended up with just using a silenced revolver, it one shots most enemies taking any series challenge from the game..better me one shotting than them! xd bugs 1010 lots of them haha, glitched flying cars, hovering while running, instant deaths, police ai, broken weapon scaling, characters talking over eachother..... i experiended tons of bugs many immersion breaking and frustrating.. conclusion, 810 i believe the devs will patch this game over the next few months, dlc is innevitable so its in their best interest to get the game fixed with patches... the game has alot of potential, witcher 3 wasn't smooth sailing at launch either. lets give them some time to sort it out."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"just perfect. cpr delvered in every aspect. people who are saying that life paths havve no meaning and that the world is not immersive have no ability to oversee a few bugs here and there. as with the witcher the most of the magic happens in the head, not the game. as with every rpg you need some kind of imagination and need to be willing to let yourself be immersed. the world of cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best ever created, in combination with the marvelous story and the exceptional side quests gigs  short get this, klii that one side quests  real side quests with unique storys question marks  can be anything and many, many open world activities you can do quickly on the run. the charakter building is almost perfect and really functions. i feel most of the negative critics are people who wanted something to turn their real life around. cpr never said that they will release a gtardrskyrim clone  no, they made their own version of a dystopian future rpg shooter. and in that field they delivered a 100. if you're into the witcher and have even a tiny bit of imagination many of the lore is in text, small details, item descriptions etc. buy this game. of course there are some bugs but the game itself is amazing. thank you cpr for this crazy immersive and superb experience!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"to start with, i am a big cdpr fanboy, witcher fanboy. etc. so i had such high hopes for cyberpunk 2077 but as much as i want to give this gave a higher score, no game ever made deserves a 10, an 8 or a 9 if this game delivered on all its promises but masterpieces just don't exist. i am still playing through many of the great side quests, finished the main story line and got one of the endings but sitting at around 35 hours or so. i have loved it and the game looks amazing, managed to run the game on highultra settings with ray tracing and get 60fps on average unless i'm speeding through the city or enter a crowded market its just a shame despite so many npcs walking the streets the game feels pretty baren. i had one crash and it was during my first few minutes when i was changing graphics settings over and over to find the best setting for my rig. the bugs i encountered were that of t poses here and there as well as once or twice my car or bike falling through the ground, lastly was a bug where the scanner function would get stuck and i had to reload my save to fix it. in the grand scheme of things none of these bugs made me mad or anything but i was just lucky. unfortunately, cdpr over sold the capabilities of this game, there's no hairdressers, ripper docs don't have further unlockable cosmetic cyberware for v to equip, i see so many characters with different cyberware and even some characters with chrome arms or bodies, v can't get anything like that, the bigest changes for v you can make are the arms, like mantis blades and gorilla arms but its honestly pretty minimal. there's no car customisation, not even being able to change the colour some them. took ages to grind for the cash to buy many of them. the quadra from the trailer, that nice black one with the spoiler and such, the one i bought in game is a bright ass aqua colour or something. the life path you chose impacts so little, in a bunch of conversations you get you nomad, street kid and corpo dialogue options, but they don't actually do much to change events or anything. the people giving 0s, 1s, 2s and 8s, 9s and 10s are  idiots with their heads up their own asses. the game isn't the messiah many wanted nor is it a steaming pile of  that is unplayable and should be thrown in the bargain bin. it is a fun game, but just not the one we were led to believe. the issue is basically we didn't get the whole pie, things were cut out or left for dlc i suspect."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. despite the bugs and crashes, its one hell . really. the story its just... amazing. ive never felt so touched by a game story like that. the weight of your decision making its surrealistic. the ending its just perfect, perfect. one wrong choice and you may change everything. this game its a absolutely must play. tho you should wait for the bugs and crashes to be fixed, so you can have a even better playthrough. i played the game on ps5 and i know this its the pc review place, but it just didnt felt right to review it on the ps4s place"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"how often does a game that's visually beautiful, luxurious, and laden with high tech weaponry and seductive design elements have you struggling to keep your eyes open half the time? cyberpunk is rare in this regard, as rare as it is uneven conversations that drag to infinity, until the music picks up and empty words start to have a little zing. characters blowing up your phone like hiroshima, until you play certain missions that allow you to get to know them. tons of upgrades and cool hacking abilities, but with no real reason to invest in them. and a story that want to breath, but is suffocated by jerky, stopandgo progression and too many characters popping in and out with no rhyme or reason. then there's v. a guy in my case who's as confused as the player getting jerked around by everyone he comes across, unable to make heads or tails of anything. where did he come from? what does he want? what is he doing at any given time, and why? questions the game can't answer, because it's too busy throwing everything it's got at the player in the most uncoordinated way possible, and then doing nothing at all. leaving the conversations to keep the momentum going on their own, which they usually fail miserably at. where is the energy? where is the forward momentum? where are the critical moments where the player takes charge and the protagonist comes to life? they exist, but only as highpoints along a largely passionless journey. it's too bad. this game has so many great ideas, and some of them come to fruition, but cyberpunk 2077 fails to bring them together with enough calculation, consistency, and determination to make the game's inner diamond shine to it's maximum luster."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"do you buy games for their nameless crowd ai? or the driving ai of the traffic clutter? i dont. i buy games that have enjoyable game play and interesting story. if your not a review brigadier or a 'game journalist' odds are high that you already own and enjoy this game. if you are looking for a once in a century masterpiece, well this aint it. but its still easily the best thing released on pc this year. hell id be willing to bet a kidney that most of these morons 0 brigading are actually playing the game and loving it on pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"they lied over and over again throughout the entire trailer videos. majority of the content was cut out which leaves a feeling as if the game is in it's alpha stage. reading the details about the game makes you realize its none of the things it tries to sell it as. story is only mediocre none of your choices matter, your lifepath don't matter. this game is only a shell of what it advertised itself to be."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk 2077 is the cyberpunk scifi game i've always dreamed of. no bugs on my end for the moment i played it 35h. i am not disappointed. everything is perfect  the story, the city, the characters, the atmosphere, the music... very good game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"for me, there is hardly anything i can say poorly about this game believe it or not. once i had downloaded the game and heard about all the issues, i expected to see many of them. to my surprise, i had encountered very little bugs or general issues during the game. the only things i experienced were some enemies that would sometime spawn inside of containers i couldn't reach. i saved regularly so i was not bothered when i had to load a save. the game consistently looked fantastic with a decent 5070 fps with only a few times dipping into the 10's or 20's. i realize i was one of the few lucky ones who played all the way through the game over 60 hrs thus far of play time without having any issues. honestly, i would take the risk and play the game, because this game turned into probably my favorite game ever."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"ended it yesterday, 50 hours on timer... and for me it's one of best games i've ever played. is it bugged?  well, yes but while i played those 50 hours i had one crash that closed my game, 2 maybe 3 times lost sound for example while running, had to stop and start run again, maybe 34 times model didn't appeared or glitched. but not a things that you can see on youtube or any vids, idk what people do to have that buggy experience. but bugs can be fixed, and definitely will be as reds showed in witcher that was buggy as well on start. the bigger problem is with ai  yes, police is for now a big problem. for me they could as well not exist and need huge repair, same with car traffic and pedestrians. but for me this game isn't about running around and doing 'nothing' like gta, it's not 5th game of this same game where you just improve things that you have included, it's something new for reds... and the plot not only main line but sidequests as well is just great. graphic probably is great too i still wait for my new graphic card to switch to higher settings but even now it's really good. and music... damn, i'm still iistening to it. tl  plot  sidequests  music  graphic  police  traffic  need bug fixes i hope police is just one of bugs and is implemented better or that they will fix it as well does this game deserve 1010? for now.. not really as it's buggy. if cdp repairs bugs will it deserve this note? definitely yes, for me it's one of best game experiences in years and i had this luck or smth not to be hit by many bugs and as i prefer to run and sightseeing without attacking random people so police didn't hunt me... well i had really good experience even now. definitely not deserve 010 so i give 1010 to align score... for now i would give it 910 anyway but won't downgrade score because of bugs that can be reapired. which game, this big game, nowadays starts without bugs? reds are known for delivering bugged games... but are known as well as those who repair their mistakes and in the end deliver really good and enjoyable experiences."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i've played this game on pc for about 30 hours now and it is very stable. i have a good pc with a 1080 video card running this game at ultra settings and i've had no crashes and no problems. there are a few minor game bugs, mainly where you occasionally can't pick up a piece of junk material off the ground, but that doesn't affect the game and doesn't bother me. the game has only been out a few days now so i'm sure cdpr will get around to minor patches for the pc sometime later. the visuals in this game are really fantastic. the city itself is stunning, the amount of unique npc's walking around the city, the individual pieces of graffiti on the walls, the unique tv ads that come over the monitors throughout the city... absolutely amazing. you can tell a lot of work went into this game. even the car traffic on the streets is great. cars will honk at you if you stop at a green light or drive on the wrong side of the road, the traffic acts as close to real traffic as i've ever seen. some people might not appreciate that, but it's that kind of layering that really adds to the feel . you can fast travel in this game, but i often drive my car from point to point just because it's just so amazing to look at how amazing the city is that cdpr built in this game. the game play and missions are really good, the number of side missions are massive and fun to play. i've probably spent 23 of my time up until now just running side missions. i can see people ripping on the game here because they expected more from the game due to the marketing, but if you don't overhype the game in your head then you'll probably appreciate this game, in my opinion i would say it's still the best of 2020 despite the overhype that the company did and the problems it has had on some console devices. definitely recommend it for a good pc system though. i heard there were bugs on the ps4 it's december right now, so if you have a ps4 just wait until february when they plan on fixing the issues. but if you have a good pc with a good graphics card then i highly recommend this game. for game play it's similar to deus ex, but far, far better in its execution, graphics and it doesn't have all that ingame purchase stuff that i hated in deus ex. there's just so much to do in this game. i highly recommend it, but don't overhype the game in your head, it's still just a video game but it's better than most and still has video game limitations. probably hold off until february 2021 if you plan to play on an old console like ps4, but i definitely recommend it for pc right now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"gra fabularnie bardzo dobra, ale ilo bdw jak na chwil obecn jest masakryczna. znikajce na oczach graczy npc, samochody, tekstury oraz glitch'e w animacjach i shader'ach. na szczcie mi jeszcze nie trafi si bd ktry zmusi mnie to zresetowania gry albo wczytania save'a."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"zip, zilch, zero, nothing, nada. thats my score. i dont care if itll be fixed with patches. i have a ps5, so the bugs didnt really affect me.the game still failed to deliver on promises had i not secured a ps5, i wouldve been one of those unfortunate ps4 users who bought a broken game. we, the consumers, shouldnt be the ones testing this hot pile of dog , because we dont work for cdpr. at least ea and ubisoft are somewhat transparent about their big corporation way of doing business. cdpr had us fooled, with their phony image of customer first enjoy this big, fat zero of a score, it also happens to be the same number as the dollars i will be spending on future cdpr games."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,game is amazing! low scorem ust be due to people playing on last gen concsoles but this game shows how advances ot is an prepared for current and next gen. beautifully made and great story. people in the game looking so realistic
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"what so big deal of this highly anticipated game? its just scrapped deus ex,gta,and cod graphic? looks standard when we already have rdr2 gameplay? generic and clunky world and level? normal town and desert with bunch of led strip everywhere, nothing unique. do this game have a.i? lol story? not really powerful and is it make people care about character? nope it left with quest, and thats the biggest factor why cdpr is so big deal in witcher 3. they make good side quest, but it depends on how it deliver the rest of. so.... its mediocre game even when all running fine the only thing that get appreciation is for marketing team, lol. thank you ledneonpunk  2077"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i was so excited about this game. i waited eagerly with everyone else. i thought this game was going to be spectacular seeing as it was developed by cdpr. i was wrong. this game is buggy, crashes, and looks terrible and im playing on xbsx. its clunky, poorly executed, and pales in comparison to every modern open world game. the content is completely dependent upon sex and filth. its the main theme all throughout the game. in diaries, on ads, magazines, posters, etc. its like a group of perverts were handed the keys to creating the vibe of the universe, and put their deepest most sexually explicit desires into every aspect of night city. its over the top and feels forced and unnecessary. the content exists for the sake of being controversial. i returned this game. biggest disappointment of 2020 in terms of entertainment."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cdpr lied to all of us. overly hyped this basic game and falsely advertised on all their marketing efforts. videos upon videos of stuff that is not even in the game, or nothing like they talked it up to be in those stupid ass nightwire videos."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"best gaming i ever had since deus ex mankind divided. this game has given me back that kind of hope in the cyberpunk genre because deus ex mankind divided has caused a wonderful disappointment at me. i know that it's a bit buggy, but come on! the developers had proven their bests as ever they could!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this game is very good. the ps4 version  and i won't write about it. after buying a ps4 version i decided to play on pc instead. so, the game itself is very good. i mean graphics, main plot and some other things. of course. there are a few things that can make you angry while playing cyberpunk 2077. some things like bugs and strange glitches, but i can forgive that. the one thing that made me angry and disappointed at the same time was the fact that the main story line is very short. i don't know why cd projekt red decided to make such a short main story. it's very disappointing. i believe they will show us at least 2 dlcs in the  they patch this game as it should be patched it will definitely deserve a good 10. i recommend playing on pc. i hardly advise you not to play the ps4 version at this time, because it just . you'll be more satisfied with the pc version. i've never seen such a good game in a few years and i believe we'll have to wait a few years to get a game that will deserve to be compared with cyberpunk 2077."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i am literally stuck in a endless credits loop after beating the main story and i am unable to get back into the game. this is quite possibly the worst video game bug i've ever experienced cd projekt red studio has no excuse for this, and i'm playing on 1500 dollar pc so this all on them. i've never played a more buggy game triple a game ever. the game has a great story line but the countless game breaking bugs takes away from it almost completely. bugs in every single mission and game breaking bugs every other mission. the story would be fantastic if you were able to get immersed but you are constantly reloading in a previous autosave because of bug that prevents you completing the mission."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"a classic example of why companies need to stop rushing the game out of the door just to meet deadlines. underneath the glitches, performance issues and game breaking lays a game with breath taking graphics, amazing story and characters. night city is in my opinion the best looking game world so far, the blade runner inspired world is a joy to explore seeing how different each section of the city looks, however, there's not much to do in night city. you can't customise your vehicles, gamble or even change your characters appearance, so far i haven't found a single mini game, i can't even play on the arcades or get a braindance from a stripper. , i thought i would get something similar to gwent or hell even play the table top games cyberpunk 2077 is a continuation of. wouldn't be great if you relive some of the stories that cyberpunk 20132020 told but as playable side missions where your main character would have to wear a vr headset to relive the memories of the characters in the tabletop. the only thing you can do in night city is side missions and i haven't played a bad one so far. most of them are pretty entertaining and a bit emotional at times. the characters are written very well and most of them are likable. i like keanu reeves as johnny silverhand i think he did well for the most part. the gunplay and combat is decent but not amazing it can janky at times and the driving needs to be a little bit better but it's still okay if you play on a controller, the traffic ai needs a complete rework hopefully it will be solved in patches and the hacking is enjoyable. the glitches, the bugs and the performance are the biggest problem with the game. it's hard to get immersed in the world when your vehicle randomly glitches out or npcs in the world walk through each other and vehicles, police randomly spawn out of nowhere and the enemy ai isn't very smart at all, they are average or even brain dead stupid at times. some of them will stand there while you are shooting at them, and some quests you do will glitch out at times forcing you to go back to your last save which does resolve the issue. even the patches that has been released it hasn't solved much of the issue. it still functions though well... on pc, the consoles? forget about it, the console versions aren't worth buying yet. i hope the ps5 and xbox x series versions are handled better. do not buy this game on consoles unless you have a ps5 xbox x series. also optimisation needs to be fixed. some areas i get 45 fps others 30, i do have an rtx 2060 and while i enjoy using ray tracing, it's hard to get a decent frame rate with rtx on, even with dlss on sometimes i below 30 fps at certain places within the game. if you have an rtx 2060, put dlss on balanced to get above 40 fps, if you aren't bothered too much about framerate being nearly locked on 30 stick it to quality. also features are missing, not everything you do effects the story and the ability to bribe cops and get powerful npcs.chasing after you are gone from this game. i hope they add it back in a patch because it would make the game better despite all of its problems i still enjoy everything else about the game. hopefully in a couple of months the game will be fixed mostly and perform better and hopefully more features will be added by the end of the year as i do feel that apart of the game is missing. once most of the bugs and glitches are fixed i re score this review an 8 and if they add more features that are good of course i will re score it a 9 maybe even a 10. this game desperately needed another delay maybe another year in development because if it was given more time we could of seen a potential game of the year for 20212022 and it might have lived up to most of it's very expectations. for anyone that doesn't have this game yet, get it within a few months, hopefully by the, the game would be mostly fixed. goodnight night city"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i played and beat the game on my xbox series x. the review is going to be divided into the following sections a. the glitches b. the look and feel c. the game and gameplay d. the campaign  story. the massive amount of glitches, bugs, freezing is completely unacceptable. its a complete nonstarter. i have to uninstall twice and managed to get through. b. with the obvious out of the way  while not revolutionary in graphics, i actually really loved the look and feel of the game. its 1st person, and i think that gives it a fresh feeling  i really did enjoy that aspect. c. i actually found the gameplay enjoyable, especially the shooting  it has an arcade game kind of vibe. while the an infinite number of options in developing your character and weapons, along with the crafting abilities is really awesome , the game itself does an absolute terrible job in balancing everything, along with feeling completely disjointed. you can beat the game without even coming close to utilizing the very large selection of customization. this leaves you updating and collecting everything, well after the main campaign is done. it feels completely unrefined in how everything is connected with regards to leveling up. d. maybe its me, but the amount of story is really overwhelming  even the ending  i found myself skipping it a lot towards the end. its just tedious. again, this may be somewhat subjective, perhaps other folks really love getting into the story, personally, i think it feels like a chore. i think about oldschoool games, like metal gear solid, etc. and you simply dive in, hear a little story here and there, and then you get to playing. it feels like the whole game was out of balance. way too much story and not enough gameplay in the campaign. i really wish a game moved away from main story  side gigs and into something that felt more like a 1st person  strategy game hybrid. but maybe that's just me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"can't get past the practice makes perfect tutorial after spending 3 hours on it. thanks for making a game so hard it makes me feel like  60 wasted, will never play it again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"it was a total disappointment... as far as plot and graphics are concerned, i havent noticed any disadvantages since the first ending. however, to my regret, the plot and graphics were my only satisfactions. the opinions of my friends are strikingly different. approximately a half of them hasnt got a regret about the purchase and a great deal of time, which they spent on cyberpunk 2077. while others have a similar opinion to mine. let me explain it. the first and the main thing is an among of bugs, such as unprocessed textures, getting objects stuck in walls, etc.. all this little bugs spoiled my expectations and the desire to replay the game several times. moreover, cd projekt red spent 8 yearsthey announced it in 2012 and 120 million  on the new cyberpunk, postponed the coming out of the game 3 times and didnt prevent bugs which the cheaper games have. talking about physics, i cannot not to mention car mechanics. i replayed farcry 3 several weeks ago and the way that cars move, they move very clumsy, is the same as in cyberpunk 2077. by the way, farcry 3 came out in 2012. summing up, cyberpunk 2077 is so overrated due to the immense amount of time of waiting of the release. i mean, people had been looking forward to it for 8 years and thay cannot say, that it is bad due to their desire to justify the time, that spent waiting for this game. it was considered to be the best game in 20202021, but the cyberpunk did not meet the expectations of more than 60 of gamers. my rate will be 510."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk's youtube channel is a gold mine of videos that show a lot of content and features that are nowhere to be found in the game. the storyline took me about 20 hours with multiple hours of side quest....joke. game is not even close to pushing boundaries on video game development. a 7yearold gta campaign has a more immersive feeling than cp2077, with way more things to do. this game is lacking so much and scammed so many people. i have no respect for cdpr, i can promise you i will never purchase a game from them again unless they give me my 60 back"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,cyberpunk 2077 is one of the greatest rpg games ever made. storyline hooks you in and keep you there until the very end. made me sad to see it end. well done cd projekt red studio

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"el mejor juego por mucho no hay juego que se compare con esta obra maestra era todo lo que esperaba en un juego de rpg, se lamenta que las versiones de consolas no lo puedan jugar bien, este juego solo debio salier primero a pc y despues de mejorarlo sacarlo a otras consolas, muchos juegos de otras consolas tambin duran meses o aos en dar la licencia o actualizarlos a esas esas versiones de consola, tambin opino que mucho de los review en esta pagina son es por los bugs en consolas, ademas que mucha gente lo dejaron jugar sin tener la actualizacion del parche dia . y la gente como es inpaciente lo juega y le da mal review por no tener una buena experiencia de principio y no por la calidad del juego en si despues de su parche dia 1 y el detalle que tiene llevo 55 horas jugados en la cuenta gog y hasta ahora wow impresionante todas las misiones, como de alguna forma se hacen familiares entre si, en la inmensidad de nigth city, es una delicia jugarlo con tiempo, no solo, ir a matar y tomar los puntos de viaje rapido que alguos no estan en el mapa y hay que buscarlos y con forme el mapa se va actualizando, las armas en el juego son geniales hasta te hace coleccionarlas las mejores armas y de crearlas, de la ropa opino lo mismo la necesitaras para abrirte caminio en el juego, las combinaciones de prendas y siempre buscando las epicas o lejendarias el ciberware increible te ofrece muchas opciones para ser una arma indestructible, el extenso arbol de habilidades neuronales son increibles,el extenso catalogo de carros y motos que te ofrece el juego, los puntos de interes en el juego, el sistema de modificacon de cada ciberware instalado, admiro a las personas que le pusieron tanto detalle en esto,hasta ahora la historia principal me tiene con ganas de seguir jugandola mas pero para estar a la altura de un golpe hay que hacer varios encargos primero, una ciudad tan basta y tan lelna de personajes por descubrir, en mi opinion solo pocos juegos me han llamado la atencion de tal manera que trasnoche por seguir viendo a donde me lleva el camino que cogi en el juego, esos han sido zelda breth of the wild, the witcher iii wild hunt, ni no kuni,red dead redemtion 1 y 2 y tambien he jugado juegos que me han decepcionado como athem, sea of tihief, conan,no man skys, the last of us 2, asi que los que quieran comprarlo haganlo sin miedo es un juego increible para jugar, solo que tuvo una mala imagen al momento de salir y repito es culpa de los usuarios que cuando lo retrasaron era por estos fallos pero que hicimos casi queman vivo a cd project por demorarse, y ahora dicen que no lo hubiesen sacado si no estaba hecho quien los entiende, y hay gente aqui que ni lo tendra y da reviw del juego"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"let me preface this by saying that i didn't buy into the hype, i'm not one of those uber fanboys of the game, and i didn't really expose myself to too much media about the game before i bought it. loved witcher 3 and was excited to try something new from cdpr. the game is ludicrously beautiful in terms of graphics and art design. the city is incredibly dense, immensely detailed, and a joy to explore. the graphical fidelity on pc is insane and i'm not running an rtx card  up close you can see clearly detailed individual threads on clothing and super fine textures. the designs of guns, clothing, and vehicles are pretty great throughout. i really can't stress enough how pretty the game is. decent performance on my computer, too. averaging around 45 fps on nearly ultra at 1440p. the first 15 hours were magical. the feeling of being unleashed in this vast city with your own freedom to do what you want was awesome. collecting new weapons, leveling up, trying out missions. the story was mostly decent, though the intro for your origin story was laughable at about 15 minutes long followed by a cinematic that skips months of your life in night city... and you basically never touch that story again. but still, fairly engaging story missions. all of it was so cool at first. and then i hit this point where it dawned on me that i'd basically experienced everything the game had to offer in terms of gameplay in that brief amount of time. from that point on, you realize there's just not much variety here. every smart weapon has the same effect, every tech weapon has the same effect, every npc, regardless of what gang they're in, acts exactly the same, every side mission is the same  kill these guys, collect this thing, move on. the npc ai is shockingly bad, like impressively lackluster. citizens do nothing but walk aimlessly, say one canned line of like 20 possible voice lines, and loop an animation. enemy npcs are completely braindead. i put almost all my points into hacking, thinking it would be this cool opportunity for cyber espionage and clever, futuristic ways of outsmarting enemies. nope. it's basically just light guys on fire from a distance while they stand around cluelessly shouting the same threat over and over. they have no way of finding you in stealth, no way of stopping your hacking, no way of even slowing you down. it is stupidly easy, even on hard difficulty. the cars handle like crap to the point that i don't even use them though motorcycles are a bit better. you see this cool scene when you get your first implant where it shows the ripperdoc changing your eye out, but from then on, getting now implants is just as basic as changing your character's pants. and speaking of characters, v has absolutely zero room for roleplaying options. you can't choose how you act in almost any situation because you're only presented with one scripted piece of dialogue, maybe two. there's just this enormous rift between the story missions and the open world that makes me feel like the game was rushed and left incomplete. the open world is so sterile in terms of gameplay. all there is to do is go from boring side mission to boring side mission doing the same thing repeatedly, selling junk at vendors, and looking at new things to buy. there's almost nothing to do in terms of cyberpunk themes. there's no crooked cops, there's no interesting things happening with gangs, there's not even an appearance of these huge megacorporations that dominate their world. it's just stunning how devoid of purpose the open world is. now don't get me wrong, there's a certain amount of fun in the game. like i said, i love exploring the city and the main story is decent. but otherwise, it ranges from an average to subaverage open world whackamole kind of game where you blast enemies like you're in a shooting gallery and pick up a ton of crappy loot to disassemble or sell. that's the game in a nutshell. it's disappointing for sure. the game doesn't innovate or set any standards whatsoever beyond visuals. it's a run of the mill aaa shooter with poop grade ai, terrible driving, and little to do beyond the main story. i wouldn't recommend this game honestly, i regret buying it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"at the current state, this game is like the deformed kid from the goonies. great story and character, and pretty cinematic, high octane moments in the main questline are marred by frequent bugs, dumb ai, and cut content. i have hope that this will become an 8 or even 9 someday."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"astonishingly bad. pathetic, an abbomination. still in shock. there were so many paths that could have been taken, we were sold a lie that this was supposed to be some second comming of jesus, reinventing the future of gaming. the npc ai is a joke  one of the worst in recent gaming history. ai behaivior is literally on gta 3 level. police literally spawn out of nowhere when you are not looking even in places that are unreachable. even if they fix all the bugs the rest of the game is very mediocre. why is there no real, different, story. what is the story? where is the main plot? it's all so concusing. how could every team department screw up so bad? from the sound design, to the cheezy music, to the coders. and whats up with the swearing and so much unnecesary    sex. why didnt they reinvent for example how first person perspective looks? something in between virtual googles and playing. what this is is a failed frankenstein of a 70 cyber gta, 20 fallout 4 and 10 need for speed most wanted."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"con 30 horas marcadas ya en mi cuenta de gog mi opinin de este juego esta aun mas clara, por un lado el mundo abierto me a encantado, he encontrando la megalpolis mas real y atrapante visualmente hablando, es una utopa en carne propia que vivimos viendo el da a da de los npc que no tendrn la funcin de ser los mas inteligentes npc de un juego, pero estn ah para denotar carcter y personalidad a las distintas zonas de la ciudad o las afueras de night city. por otro lado, la historia del juego y la narrativa actual de el mismo me esta enamorando, atrapando cada hackeo, cada apagn de cmaras que hago en tiempo real, cada misin que se me otorga y la posibilidad y libertad que me da. son pocos y nada los juegos que me la han otorgado y estoy muy sorprendido de la calidad del juego en mi experiencia como jugador de pc lo jugu el da de salida con el parche ya puesto y los bugs que presentaba el juego eran los tpicos de cualquier sandbox que sale el da 1, para la actualizacin 1.04 los bugs visibles eran nfimos ya que yo me limitaba a salir a recorrer las calles, visitar a los riperdogs y completar misiones secundarias , ayudar a la polica o casar a npc con recompensas  dejando de lado que tambin sigo la historia principal el juego me a parecido un gustazo enorme y de momento me esta convenciendo de lo que realmente es, un juego de rol con posibilidades de hacer las misiones como se me plazcan, en mi caso es el sigilo, el juego lo fomenta mucho y aun mas si mis atributos de temple y fuerza estn avanzados. el juego premia cada decisin en combate como en sigilo y fomenta cada forma de jugar de manera totalmente independiente, aunque si tienes un equilibrio de todo te dejara igual de todas formas.. las localizaciones y misiones que te da el juego son muy variadas y sin contar de las sorpresas de algunas corpos motelnotell 4 planta! que me han dejado sorprendidos y interacciones as, el poder llamar con mi telfono integrado y responder a ciertos mensajes me dan una sensacin de interaccin muy agradable. espero que mis prximas 30 horas sean igual de buenas en el caso contrario comentare y cambiare mi opinin aqu y dar a conocer cada punto por separado para denotar bien los pro y los contras de esta obra que me esta encantando a las 32,4 horas que le tengo . dado que mi rol no es el de jugar a gtav en cyberpunk 2077 no he podido ver el problema de la polica y como respeto las normas de trafico tampoco me a tocado ver como actan los npc. agrego algo que me gusta que si he notado son la negociaciones clandestinas que hacen las bandas en donde me aprovecho de todo y me quedo con el botn."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,i feel completely betrayed by their marketing. i fully regret getting this game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,beside bugs cause cdp will fix it anyway. the game is nice. but only nice. the story of course is amazing. but the rest of it is .. they promise a lot more. the city is beautiful but after 30 hours is boring as hell. street cred is awful. missing a lot of features. game is good but still disappointed.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"truly an amazing game. one of the best looking pc games out there. it also has a good and engaging story. have not been this immersed in a long time. game gives me lack of sleep due to not beeing able to put it down at night. interesting and really well played characters. everybody should experience night city. on the pc version i have experiences very few glitches and when they do its mostly some npc glitching into something. no crashes or game breaking bugs. there is so much going on in this game. main missions are awesome. most sidemissions have the same quality and often same length as main missions. there are also shorter missions called gigs that are fun to play. no problem recommending this game your pc is up to it. its demanding with all whistle and bells on, but turning down gfx and effects it can be played also on older pc's. excited to see what more they will do with time with this game. it can only get even better."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the world of cyberpunk 2077 is dead, its plastic and fake. a real disappointment. they are not only technical errors or bugs. the details and the interaction with the world in this game is 0. the player does not even leave footprints in the mud, the puddles are ground directly, nor do they sound. it's just an example. i say this as a small interaction with the environment, which is null at all. the effect under water is bad. cars are useless the street npcs and their reactions are the worst we've ever seen. information and tutorials are missing from the menus. the police teleport instead of going with one of those flying vehicles as we see at the beginning of the story, they don't follow you with the car either. some npcs are presented directly by phone without seeing them first. etc etc. it is impossible not to compare it to other open world games like gta or rdr2 where the detail is incredible and the world feels alive, in this game it is not. the story is good and interesting. the gameplay is good and fun but it looks tainted by all its bugs and crappy things."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,even with the glitches and bugs this game is off the hook! like many other tabletop gamers i been waiting 8 years for this. they really have outdone themselves with the content. definitely worth the wait.i hope they have plans to expand this into a multiplayer concept at some point. where you can build gangs and work together as a team. well done! i am sorry but i can help but laugh at all the people who are giving this bad reviews because their system is  read the requirements... if your system doesnt meet the minimum you arent going to enjoy what happens next. learn to upgrade your pc people
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"fantastic game, graphics, story, characters ... love it. still buggy but i'm sure they will fix it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i didn't finish the witcher 3 because it was just so damn long. i don't wanna finish cyberpunk because it's just so damn dull. the bigger gripes the ai is far behind games like gta iv. yes, the one from 2008. the bugs. oh sweet baby jesus. i actually feel terrible for those who got swindled of their cash playing on the og xbox one and ps4 consoles. if you bought digitally attempt a refund through the store page you bought it from. if not then head to that link cdpr mentioned and get your money back before next week. the hustles and sidegigs. people wanted more depth in even filler quests and random encounters since the days of fnv. that was 2010 and you still couldn't figure that out? go here, loot this. go here, shoot them. return to atm in wall and drop off quest item, receive eddies. spoilers ahead from here. the prologue doesn't mean anything at all. i only played most of the way through as corpo and spent maybe 15 minutes as one. i also spent about 2 hours with jackie before he wound up flatlined. not a bad bit of story there but i never really cared because it was such a short time that i spent with a character meant to take the training wheels off. the rest of the story really isn't that much better. you meet johnny silverhand, the  rockerboy who is actually just a little bit of a pansy. you'd think if he was living in your consciousness and seeing what you see he would have a lot more to say, but you have some pretty short, lame conversations with the guy and that's about it. the driving. i feel like a sports bike handles like an articulated city bus. the first vehicle you get is about as sloppy as what it must be to guide a crew capsule back to earth atmosphere while being slapped in the face repeatedly by a whole class of 6th graders. if you don't believe me still and have the money to spare, give it a shot. so far though, sounds like to me that cyberpunk 2077 has flatlined, and flatlined hard."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,one of the best games i've played personally. the storywriting is phenomenal the gameplay it's self is quite good. personally the bugs haven't affected me and i played it on a day one xbox one. this being said i don't know if i've been lucky in encountering bugs or the bugs are being heavily overstated.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,". i would suggest either using a top end pc or not getting the game at all. i reached out to cdpr for a refund request and have yet to hear back. the game is unplayable. cdpr are liars and theives. do not waste your money please. i am giving 2 points, 1 for the semi interesting story and 1 for the character panam."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"like the witcher 3 cyberpunk 2077 delivers a great rpg experience with so many great side quests and a decent story.however, if you don't have a good hardware you need to wait until cd projekt red releases a new update to improve the performance."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"hugely unfinished, horrible gamebreaking bugs, poor performance, tons of console to pc port problems. should have delayed 6 months. that's not even going into the many incredibly mediocre and uninspired game mechanics. most of which are shallow and halfimplemented. even if all the bugs and options were fixed, this game is a 610 at best. the world feels more hollow than any other openworld rpg i've played. i've spent more time encountering situations where i go wait, i can't go in there? or why can't i do this? for basic stuff. your choices mean little to nothing ingame, the world doesn't change, your origin has no impact on the game. the whole story arc is supposed to be a rags to riches scenario and yet you can't even changeupgrade your apartment, can't join clans, or work up into a corpo. all of this character development happens for you during the flashforward montage at the start of the game. where you get to watch all that wonderous content they scrapped. it's honestly a joke. i had zero expectations for this game and it's still a disappointment. witcher 3 had many of these same issues on release as well. they haven't improved at all."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"pc version, unbelievable game. seems like a game that pushes existing rpg mechanics and game tech to new limits albeit with a few easily ignored hitches and bugs. beautiful, vibrant world that feels rewarding to explore and stuffed full of so many small minute details. combat feels fantastic, driving a bit touchy but quickly got used to, and ingame skills and systems are fun to develop and level up. i cannot speak to other platforms, but it does feel like a generational step up in gaming, appropriate for new consoles and new pc hardware. hopefully going forward there are ways that people can afford to enjoy it as i have."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the pure essence and with that i mean side and main content ist masterful and definitely a 1010, but there are some aspects which fall short in comparison and i'm sure that if this were a linear story game or a rockstar open world type of thing, that it would have been without a doubt a 1010, since genres like those are centered around the campaign, but cyberpunk is an open world rpg. don't get me wrong, i love the open world of cyberpunk, it's verticality and amazing complex structures, but cyberpunk 2077 fails to deliver in some simple key areas, that are fundamentally important for the sake of immersion, like being able to go to the barber, sit in a bar and have a drink or two, or generally being able to interact with people like red dead redemption 2, with that i mean antagonising people, killing, attacking, steeling from them and as a consequence the npc's reacting accordingly, however in cyberpunk 2077 npc's are merely placeholders with no ai whatsoever, if you shoot nearby or attempt to aim your weapon at them, npc's won't try to counter your attack nor will they show any kind of reaction to your actions, regardless of what you did, they will just start to crouch and despawn after you lost sight of them, the same goes for traffic as well, if you try to block a road npc's wont try to drive around your car, they will just stay and wait in line for you to move, because they have no ai whatsoever. i understand that these games can't be compared since the level of scale and immense number of npc's is not comparable to rdr2 but games like gta 5 or even watch dogs legion have large numbers of npc's and delivered better. this was one negative aspect out of a dozen. the combat is mediocre, maybe it will get better the more i progress, the variety of gameplay and replayability is amazing, although i'm a bit sceptical whether or not the lifepath choice makes a substantial difference or not. well, since i haven't got all day i would like to wrap it up in a few sentences. the game is good, but fails to deliver in basic areas which have become the industry standard, even though ai is terrible the world still feels alive, in every corner there is something happening, occasionally you will hear npc's talking about the personal matters and police investigating crime scenes, arresting criminals, gang wars and more. ithink that it is very clear that the base consoles had a negative effect on cyberpunk 2077 and that this game should have come out only for the series x, ps5 and pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"as someone who had played quite a bit of pen and paper rpgs converted into video games, i wasn't expecting much from cyberpunk 2077. the visuals in promotional materials looked stunning, and the overall general concept for the game seemed compelling. after roughly 20ish hours i can say the game has certainly exceeded what i expected in some areas, while failing to deliver in areas i thought to be easy water to tread in modern open world games. for instance, the personal story and set up for the game is very compelling. you meet some interesting characters and start with a friendship that feels earned, although i really want more interpersonal relationship development in a game like this. contrast that with some of the most abysmal driving i've played in the past few decades. every car controls like a boat on icy water, with traffic that doesn't really feel like its being driven by proper ai. that was the early letdown for me, and a common theme in the game, a lot of systems that could be better, not the worst, but really in need of improvement. you couple the myriad of underdeveloped games systems with a ui that isn't easy to read, and bug after bug after bug, and you get cyberpunk. i have some hopes that cd projekt will patch the game into a better state but as it stands, a 6 is the best i can give it. it has a lot of potential, and has provided me with a healthy serving of genuine fun, but becomes a drag to play when things just don't work right."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,the game was great in the first 10 or so hours of playing. after i started noticing a lot of things that just didn't feel great. it's like the game has features but just as checkboxes. like for example is their romance in the game yes check the box is the romance meaningful and engaging once you finish the romance quest line no. the immersion of night city falls away when you realized the npcs are less advanced than grand theft auto 3 npc ai. i could list everything that the reddit furoms and other reviews say but why bother in the end red is just another corp looking for income and making sure the shareholders are happy. how the mighty have fallen. i think what hurts me the most is all the promises they said about the game. so much missing content. i have never written a review before but i felt i had to write something to express how i feel about the release. i will add more to the score as they add the missing content back to the game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the game is absolutely phenomenal. the rpg elements are extensive, the worldbuilding excellent, and the characters extremely well written. the city is utterly beautiful and shockingly immersive this is the only open world game i've ever played where i haven't used the fast travel functionality once. it is buggy and the ai needs improvement, but there is so much that this game gets right that far outweighs its issues."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cbp2077 is a good game with deep side and storyline . you need atleast 100hr if u want to complete all side quests , and believe me , almost all are unique! dont listen to bunch of antihypers , or ppl that tried to play this game on poteto and past gerenation consoles! graphics are amazing if  optimization also ok , but could be better . played on i7 3930k and gtx 1080 gpu"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"there's been a lot of controversy with this game, so some of that unfortunately needs to be addressed before i can even review the game. such are the times we live in.  transphobia they could have allowed players to simply choose their gender, not determine it by voice. an oversight, but they do allow choice in genitalsgender. the game does objectify trans characters  exaggerate sexual presentation ... everyone else a trans character on a poster might have bulging biceps  a heavy crotch. heteronormative characters are similarly exploited. that is the point of satire, and especially in this capitalist, violent, sexualized,  technophilic dystopia. you decide, do you want a sterilized environment that pretends that humanity will not use capitalism, sexuality, fear,  bias to its advantage?  asian  in our world today, technological improvements do frequently come from japan, china, south korea, vietnam   all these have their own approaches to it in production, in art and aesthetic, in advances. cyberpunk supposes that this expands, and it does presuppose that japan leads in that innovation. whether we agree that is realistic or not is beside the point. cyberpunk is a fiction. the answer, then, is to bring in the multiplicity of languages, diversify the representation  depiction, make them visible. that. is. exactly. what. cdprojekt. has. done. artvisuals stunning. the same quality as witcher 3, though the aesthetic is very different. i don't find myself gaping in awe at the beauty as much, but then i don't really do that with any other aaa game, and it is a dystopian world. the eye flits from thing to person to light, wondering at the activity, engaging in the city life around me. my 1000 pc, a year old, handles it all pretty well, without many hiccups, on medium ray tracing. the clothing looks wet too often though,  a little plasticky. 9.010 gameplay it's taken some getting used to because of the variety. hacking, shooting, fighting, melee with shooting weapons, targeting, cyberware action hacking different than regular terminal hacking, sneaking, roleplaying choices, racing, recon, throwables, explosive environments, police responses, random encounters and jobs, stores  goodness. lions  tigers  bears oh my. i find myself having fun in one way, then another, then another, then coming back to the story  taking my time getting to know both night city  my character. 910 character creationdevelopment this part is quite a joy. i enjoy the twopart leveling system of street cred  levels. the levels work much the same as they did in witcher 3, opening up item use. street cred does a similar thing, as do stats skill choices require stats at certain levels. in the end, it drives you to think very carefully about your choices,  the game style you want, but it doesn't punish you for not being a robot of efficiency. i play on hard  i've shifted the focus of my stats more than once. the physical character creation is detailed  flexible, allowing male, female,  trans characters like bg3. one thing that is worth mentioning is that your choices in stats have many opportunities to matter. this includes dialogue. really, where are all the people that trash first person shooters for useless stealth mode or forced stealth mode? no? silence? 9.510 story it doesn't evoke the same emotional response as witcher 3, even witcher 2, vampire bloodlines, and other great great titles. we'll see. i do appreciate certain characters. perhaps if people spent a little less time presenting their cool side, or their bfg and their ba threads, and more their human side, i'd be pulled in. but, that's the world we live in, eh? still, the human disassociation takes its toll on the storyline. i think there's room to do both. otherwise, story progresses well. not too predictably, lots of options, lots of wit, lots of character. 8.710 world the world comes to life beautifully. characters speak in multiple languages with correct inflection. i'm not used to seeing such attention to culture  language except for certain ac games. architecture varies across districts. atmosphere changes across the day  its changing lighting, in various rooms, down varied alleyways. the size is quite large  on the level of gta5 or so. it truly feels like a city  not a few blocks to provide the impression of a city. one hears snatches of arguments, lovers' spats, notes a couple staring at the sunset on a construction zone overlooking the city, radio personalities reminiscent of v bloodlines  deb of the night ok, nobody is as good as deb. sound scapes, visual scapes  they come together beautifully. they give you useful information, flavor, opportunities to engage  all of it. 9.710 total 9.310 possibly 9.0  9.5 i am, after all, only on act i here's to more of this kind of video gaming. let's not destroy the things we love most because they don't meet our ideal."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i haven't finished the main story yet. but the huge amount of gameplayimmersion breaking bugs, poor ai, and performance issues even on highend pc all keep bashing my experience to the negative side. the marketing of the game during the last two years promised a lot and only little was delivered in the current version 1.04. overall, cp2077 is rushed and it is so unfortunate."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this game is completely overhyped. the main storyline is engaging with a nice pace but only for about 40 hours ingame. and then there is barely anything to do. the potential of the megacity is completely not used. hacking in a cyberpunkstyle game should be one of the main skills but here it's complete crap. upskilling the character is useless as the skills barely change the game experience. i would see if anyone was so determined to go through the game with stealth and hacking only. most of the engagements end in a bloody mess with really poor implementation of the combats. the company promised it will fix issues by february but i bet there will be not many payers still waiting for that. content packs announcement could solve that issue but with all the resources assigned to bug fixing, i doubt we will get anything valuable in h1 2021. so wait for the gold edition with 70 discounts to enjoy the solo main story quest chain. i feel the company has cheated on me with promises not delivered and i bought a product that is not what it was promised. as cd projekt red acted like a regular peddler i will be extremely cautious with their games in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"9.510 i just went back from 60h run and read that people are experiencing bugs. i did not have any immersion breaking bugs, although i got over recommended pc specs. a shame, i hope everyone could experience what i just did, great story, fast pace katana gameplay, rpg build theorycrafting. my experience not tainted by bugs was 9.510, it sound petty compared to others but i just dislike keybinds, especialy dodging."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"pc version, unbelievable game. seems like a game that pushes existing rpg mechanics and game tech to new limits albeit with a few easily ignored hitches and bugs. beautiful, vibrant world that feels rewarding to explore and stuffed full of so many small minute details. combat feels fantastic, driving a bit touchy but quickly got used to, and ingame skills and systems are fun to develop and level up. i cannot speak to other platforms, but it does feel like a generational step up in gaming, appropriate for new consoles and new pc hardware. hopefully going forward there are ways that people can afford to enjoy it as i have."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"my review is only for the pc and my own personal experience with the game. in my experience, i experience minor bugs even do it was constant, for example, doors lock even do they suppose to be open, weapon information stuck on the screen, and out of place speech of characters. other than that i did not experience any crash or major issues. i love the story and the events on the main mission and also the side quests. i really have fun with the game, in my opinion, if it had more deep customization would be a plus. i would have loved to be able to customize my cars and apartments. this is a game in my opinion if for not the major bugs that i did not experience, is a game that is worth coming back and play it again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"8 years of waiting and 80 of cut content. cyberpunk is the biggest flop of the year. gunplay feels clumpy, driven is terrible, npcs are lifeless, ai is more outdate than ps2 titles. life path doesnt make the game that much different than the other. at least the graphics are nice... for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the game has fantastic graphics, if your pc can handle it, its a fantastic visual experience, but that is all the good i can say about it, there is nothing more, a city that feels more like a theatrical scenery than a real world, there are no rpg elements in this game and it has the worse ai i have ever seen in a video game, totally immersion breaking."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"unplayable on xbox one, even after the recent patch. the graphics are extremely bad  xbox 360 bad, the streets are mostly empty, the ai is worse than halo 1. riddled with bugs and glitches, which i would have looked past. but the graphics make this unenjoyable. i want my money back but they refused to. what a disappointment. i wish i waited and bought the ps5 version."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,cannot put 10 until they fix all the bugs and improve all the ias but the history is wonderful and after playing more than 50h of hacking i didn't finish the game yet but i will play again and again to test other builds.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,", no adianta. por mais boa vontade que se tenha com cyberpunk, o problema dele  estrutural. se fossem s os bugs e performance, seria uma beno. a histria parece interessante, o que j era de esperar da cdproject red, porm o core dele  quebrado  cagado  pra dizer a verdade e ser mais gentil. eu acho que patchs podem resolver muitas coisas dos bugs, mas algumas questo so bem mais complicadas... como as mecnicas defasadas, as to faladas escolhas no game, influenciam em praticamente uns 30 minutos de jogo. o gameplay as vezes parece saindo do skyrim ou gta 3. o melee  triste de se ver, tudo  genrico e truncado, o gunplay no fica muito longe. tiros sem impacto nenhum, atirar no p ou no peito, no tem diferena alguma, aquele the division feeling. a fsica  prxima a zero. npcs sem reao ou reaes ridculas que esto al abarrotando o mundo s por estar, sem propsito nenhum e ainda aparecem uns 3, 4 iguais ao mesmo tempo. o stealth  de dar risada de to fraco e ultrapassado que . o sistema de polcia, a forma como eles respawnam,  de dar vergonha alheia. a movimentao do personagem, nem se fala. acho que no vejo uma movimentao to ruim desde...,sinceramente, nem consigo lembrar, e isso que  em primeira pessoa, que teoricamente serviria para camuflar a m ou a inexistncia de movimentao do personagem, a vc olha para a sombra dele, e kkkk. 7 anos, pra isso, srio? a impresso que eu tive  que os prprios devs perderam o amor pelo jogo no decorrer do desenvolvimento, como se tivessem percebido que ele no era l aquela obraprima to esperada, e no final j estavam fazendo por obrigao mesmo. dificilmente se percebe a dedicao e o amor que colocaram em witcher 3, por exemplo. em witcher 3 vc percebe que eles mesmos estavam curtindo demais todo aquele universo, eram como fs de rock que de repente tiveram a oportunidade de participar da sua banda predileta, fizeram o seu melhor e acreditaram em si mesmos e no produto do seu trabalho sempre ...toda essa sensao passa longe em cp2077. tudo feito nas coxas. at os grficos, se voc reparar bem, no so l essas coisas, muito efeito e ps processamento para mascarar que a modelagem em si so padro 2015, e olhe l. e a falta de uma pegada mais cinematogrfica prejudicou demais a percepo de grficos bonitos. muito potencial desperdiado. no justifica todo o peso do jogo. ainda colocaram o modinha keanu reeves, muito nitidamente de ltima hora,  visvel que ele no era uma parte do plot do game desde o incio, visto a forma como a histria dele  mal encaixada no lore do game, para que ele possa aparecer mais vezes no decorrer do logo. cppr fez a fama com witcher 3, e deitou na cama, literalmente. o agravante foi a quantidade absurda de prvenda, por causa witcher 3  simplesmente, para eles isso foi um alvio quando viram que o produto final no estava nem em 30 da expectativa da comunidade. mas fica a lio, preorder s pensando 3 vezes antes. enfim, cp2077  um jogo ok, muito pela histria, mas o gameplay  de 7 anos atrs. a chance de ser goty, s se comprarem muitas reviews mundo afora, seno t muito difcil. da minha parte, s fico aliviado porque no vou precisar comprar uma 3090 to cedo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,this game is crap. they lied to us all the way up until the day the game released. what a joke.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,awesome story and seeming solid mechanics but the bugs make immersion difficult and requires regular loads. open world ai also leaves a lot to be desired. if it could get cleaned up could easily be a 9.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"performance and bug issues aside that is, supposing the game runs beautifully without game breaking or visual bugs, the game has a remarkably shallow level of interactivity that is a few steps down from other cdpr games and most other contemporary open world games. any time you chose one of the dialogue options or presented methods of resolving a quest that isn't roleplaying as the an aimless, 1dimensional anarchist streetkid v regardless of chosen lifepath, the game falls apart and resolves the quest as if you had picked that outcome. there are a few occasions where lifepaths remember, a lifepath is supposed to be so substantial  choice and roleplaying element that you should be forced to create an entirely new game to experience a different one may influence dialogue with an npc, but they are typically things like negotiating more money for a job or an additional line of dialogue that has no impact on the outcome of the quest. this gameplay mechanic, which is supposed to be the saving grace of the game and allow for multiple playthroughs, therefore making up for the game's relatively short length actually has very little impact on the progression of the game. one playthrough is definitely enough to experience the game without missing anything. additionally regardless of the lifepath, there is usually only one resolution to a quest  this is in stark contrast to every game the studio has ever made and contemporary rpg design which cdpr themselves is partly responsible for. the choices are often presented in such a way where you think you are definitely going to get a different outcome, but the alternate resolution to the quest simply doesn't exist and you are forced to do it anyways. a spoiler free example is you are given a quest to investigate someone and report back with your findings. you tell them what happened no choice to say nothing is wrong, and the questgiver kills them. then they call you to clean up the mess and the game gives you an option to help them or leave them. regardless of which choice you make, you have to carry the body to a dumpster. it's not buggy, skyrim is buggy. the game is simply not finished. you can clearly tell that it's not finished because the gameplay mechanic for introducing you to new characters is to have them randomly call you with a short bio and then the extent of the quests they give you is to buy cars from them or to shoot up a dingy trap house to collect loot and lore shards that are utterly forgettable and sometimes completely incoherent or containing developerstory notes that make you think they are a part of the preproduction notes for the game. in addition, instead of a prologue introducing the gameplay mechanics, you get a 1 minute montage of your character being a street kid and doing quests for the valentinos an ingame gang and doing cool things that you wish were actually in the game. the corpo intro abruptly ends after you taking a flying car to a bar and have onedimensional conversations with tposing purple haired androids. in addition to the unfinished narrative elements, the open world gameplay mechanics driving ai in the context of quests or narrative expositions like driving with a character are immersion breaking and bad, the nonquest npcs in the world are not interactive beyond one line of generic dialogue or killing them. the extent of what happens is they crouch down and put their hands in the air and shake around until you move far enough away from them that the game can cull them from existence. but if you kill them you get a wanted star like in gta. that should allow for some fun emergent gameplay right? getting chased and having to escape the police? no if you do anything illegal 3 police officers pop into existence next to you and start shooting even if you are on top of a building. and if you shoot back more keep popping in until you get ones that do hundreds of damage per bullet and you die. and you may say, what did you expect? well i expected that a game with a budget of 300 million made in 2020 and is marketing itself as a open world game with driving and reactive police systems would at least match what gta iii, a nearly 20 year old game was able to accomplish and make run on a ps2. there are more problems with the core gameplay mechanics than this but i am actually characterlimited. what are the good aspects of the game? it has really good lighting, the world is very details and fun to look at. and the combat is aboveaverage. it's fun to play stealth or with blades. but in general, if you are expecting to enjoy doing anything other than shooting up random buildings and looting and selling stuff and repeat, you are going to be disappointed."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i give the story itself, the main quest line story, an 8. of course, it can only be an 8 if you do the right side quests which fills out johnny's character and v's relationship to him. if you just do the main quest line, the story is at most a 6. the open world aspects get a 0. they aren't there. you can't really customize anything. most of the shops are unfinished, and half of the shops that were supposed to be in the game do not exist at all. it is very easy to have a million eurodollars and literally nothing to spend it on. the game physics are ... passable. car physics are a bit bad. driving is atrocious. there's supposedly interesting bullet physics in the game, but there is literally 0 reason to use them. 410  because the driving is that damned bad. rpg elements. even worse than the open world. they just aren't there. 010. i wish i had more to say, but they just aren't there. the reputation system, wanted system, etc is an absolute joke. cops spawn from thin air in front of you and even if you have the maximum level of wantedness, it will completely fall away if you simply walk a block. 010 the character customization tool is nice, but very much under utilized. you can only do any character customizing during creation  you can't change your hair, get tattoos, etc during the game. there are three  sizes to choose from, but only 1  variation. and it doesn't matter as i played through the game twice and never once saw my own junk. not once. if you are wearing a hat and look in a mirror which, btw, is not a reflective surface in the game world that you walk past, it's one of a handful of things you must interact with, you are bald. inexplicable you are bald and not wearing your hat. in the mirror. 010 personally, i do not think this is a big of a ripoff as no man's sky was. however, no man's sky was from a dev with a lot less experience. there is no excuse at all for cdpr, who did this after the nms debacle. and lied through their teeth the entire time. genuinely, people should be in jail because of this. fraud is a crime."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the game is very successful but not as shown in the trailers. rpg rpg elements only affect the end of the game, maybe one or two side missions, but not as successful as advertised. you can influence your character, you can finish the game as a hacker if you want without fighting with any enemy. i used weapons and melee weapons. although the melee is not very successful, the weapons are really impressive. action it does not feel as good as a fps game, but it feels enough, especially tech guns are very good. close combat is not very successful. bombs are nice but a few bombs are unnecessary. body implants are pretty good. you feel the difference when you wear it. but ai is very bad. some enemies stare blankly instead of squeezing. open world  tasks you feel yourself in the game. graphics are very successful. open world ai is very bad. when you park the car on the road they wait like a fool. if you enjoy the action, you will love the open world missions and they repeat each other. vehicle driving dynamics have nice realistic sound effects"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"per quanto questo gioco, sia su versione pc e next gen ma sopratutto su old gen, abbia bisogno di parecchie pacth, ed  innegabile questo fatto, secondo me bisogna vedere cyberpunk come l'inizio verso una nuova generazione di giochi open world perch, tralasciando le missioni principali che devono finire sempre in un modo, ogni missione secondaria o contratto pu finire in modi diversi e non ci sono un paio dimissioni secondarie ma sono decine, questo comporta un enorme numero di variabili che porta ovviamente a un numero di bug pi grande, ma proviamo ad immaginare un gioco open world con una mappa grande come quella di cyberpunk o di pi esplorabile come quella di cyberpunk o di pi con ancora maggiore scelta, ovvero che neanche le missioni principali debbano avere un inizio pi o meno uguale e una fine pi o meno uguale, ma possano essere estremamente diverse in base alle nostre scelte con pochissimi bug questo sarebbe il futuro ma ancora non  momento, io credo che cyberpunk nella versione attuale ovvero la 1.04 sia sufficentemente giocabile , ovviamente non e accettabile che il gioco resti cos ma stiamo vedendo che la cd projekt ci sta mettendo molto impegno nel risolvere il pi possibile questi problemi ma giustamente c' bisogno di tempo, infatti io credo che questo gioco diventer uno dei pi belli mai fatti bisogna solamente saper aspettare"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i have to make this review because i've been waiting for this from the very first teaser trailer and i am disappointed by this. this could've been regarded as a masterpiece if it wasn't for the features that was cut out, less buggy, and an unoptimized mess. blaming people for having an oldgen when it was advertised where it's aimed at. this was never a nextgen if it wasn't delayed and got released last april. no rtx 30 series cards, and no ps5, and series x. the excuse would've been invalid but the amount of defending this game just because you are not experiencing bugs, glitches and running on high fps, then congrats on being part of the 10 who have highend pc or just lucky. the minimum specs for pc however, was gtx 780 or rx 470, but they never mentioned how many fps they were getting. instead, you have to find out when it was released. now, i'm pointing out it's missing features, and errors or flaws. if there is something that i have missed, then add it to your own list. this is also what i gathered from other people's opinions in which i agree with as i don't know how to put a review properly. negatives  there is a good bit amount of spelling errors on dialogues, signs, and on shards.  ai system as a whole is just disappointing enemies, cops, civilians, cars, i thought it would be the same level as gta v at least.  gunplay is not that great, but i would say average, while it's somewhat a bit satisfying on my side still not good enough to carry on it's own.  customization is lacking, they removed the car customization, no barbershop, and tattooist as people mentioned, and the character customization is just average as well. 2018's demo of their character customization is really good, it was easy to see because you can choose the color and not pick left or right and guess what color are they and not just that, there are other parts of it that they were proud to show.  armor system, i really don't know why they decided to use the clothes as armor, i just thought maybe it would've been great if they put it on cyberware as it actually makes sense because you replace your body with a better system or mods.  rpg but instead was an actionadventure game, this is not a negative but i just think that this should be considered as false advertising.  no difference in 3 lifepaths, their difference only was the first 30 mins and only a few dialogue options and that's it. no replayability.  openworld is dead, yeah sure, you get side activities if there is a robbing happening but that's it. no interactions at all. i'm not talking about getting into each and every building, but just the world itself.  driving. probably the most annoying handling on any cars i have ever seen in any game. the car's handling is so bad that it's hard to turn without over steering unless you drive 50mph. but if you drive 200 mph and you could see jesus miles away before you turn. gta v's handling on keyboard is miles better compared to this. positive the game's story is great, it's carrying the game so hard but barely because of the missing features that were promised. the characters as well. if it wasn't for these, it would've been a disaster. johnny silverhand  keanu reeves performance was great, i think his character fits very well to his voice because he's a stonecold  people may not agree with me here but i actually think he did a good job as johnny silverhand. there are some serious lines that i shouldn't laugh but because of his voice it makes me chuckle a bit. overall, i do like the game, however with these missing features and npcs it's hard not to notice it, the optimization of this is not forgivable. if they should've just kept their mouth shut until a year before release and blaming people for being hyped while i do not allow sending death threats then there would be no high expectations, but instead, they promised us lies and deception and eventually bit them in the ass. i hope they add those features eventually as it is possible, but right now it's not worth the 60 and it's a goddamn mess."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this game will be fully appreciated some time after the release, when most of the bugs will be fixed and the haters will subside. it is deep and detailed, it has its own style, atmosphere and quality narrative. it is worthy of attention."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk 2077! this is the game that everyone should be recommended to play. maybe in this game there are bugs on the release, but everything else is at the highest level, shooting mechanics, side tasks, character development in this game i remembered each character by name, because i believed that they were alive what can not be said about the characters of ubisoft games. the plot of the game. there are no words to describe how carefully cd project treated its performance. it's sad to see people's bad grades. i think that cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games of the decade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"pretty cool wellwritten story. all main characters have their own story and background and players can explore that during side quests. so amazing character writing. in a few hours you are so attached to these characters. great graphics, still need some patches though for a few not game breaking bugs. most side quests add to the story and the rest are interesting and fun. only some are repetitive. wish the story had more complicated aspects like for example your life path should change the story significantly and not just the first 15 minutes or some dialog options or starting clothes. many complain about the lack of a police system or ai driving but this is not a gta game. i would not want it to be one personally. this game is all about story, characters and feelings. that is what i am looking for in a game, so for me it is a 10!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"one of the best open world setting for an rpg to date. absolutely beautiful and has a wonderful story to lead you through it and enough side quests to keep you distracted for hours. there are occasional graphical glitches. i didn't experience any kind of crash or gamebreaking bug. just the occasional floating phone or overlapping subtitle. don't expect to hit ultra and be able to play the game at 60 fps. it's built for future hardware. a lot like ms flight sim or any other aaa game heavily reliant on immersion. like witcher 3, the game has about a 10h prologue. more if you get wrapped up in sidequests, less if you blitz. once that passes though the game opens up and you are free to explore all the back alleys and ripper shops around town. your choices do matter. if you're expecting jarvis level ai to call you up for a drink than you need to lower your expectations, if google home can't do it, neither can a game's ai. but characters do tailor their responses to your actions and you can entirely expand or fridge npcs depending on how you interacted with them and your environment. combat can take many paths and synergies can be set up effectively between each type. personally i'm enjoying a netrunner style but melee, stealth, and shooter styles are all there and fun. it seems a lot of user reviewers really had their expectations set to something ridiculous. cyberpunk is an excellent game and easily one of the best rpgs out there. but it's not game changing. and that's okay. as an aside it was discussed as a possible project before witcher 3, but cyberpunk has been in earnest development for around 4 years starting after witcher 3's final dlc was released. not the 8 that's floating around, not that development time should really matter. we didn't pay them for the game x number of years ago so they owed us nothing on a schedule. a reviewer's impatience should not be a slight against a developer. and note that any reviewer that didn't stick around the finish the prologue didn't actually experience the game. it's a 50100h playtime game with many different endings. as for the ps4 and xbox one problems. it should never have been released on 7 year old consoles with potatoes for hardware. that's a big mistake by cdpr and further shows the problem with consoles lagging far behind pc yet having silly long life cycles. i honestly believe cyberpunk would have been a better game had it focused solely on pc and next gen console platforms. unfortunately, cdpr put themselves in a console bind and it'll hurt their rep over an otherwise great game. if you're on pc  get it. enjoy it. and ignore the obsolete consoles crying foul. they'll hopefully get their refund and we can go back to flatlining scavs!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i finished the main story and did some side quests, as well as experienced with some decision you can make. you have to compare the game to other open world games, like rdr2, gta, fallout, skyrim and so on. and comparing to these, cyberpunk 2077 isn't as good as the mentioned above or even other open world games. positive graphics, design, world. negative gameplay is outdated. ai is outdated. random encounters are non existing. stealth feels like 20 years ago, but even games from 20 years ago did stealth better. the world feels just like a backdrop. there are almost no interactions with the world or random encounters that feel like you are a part of a world. the are almost no decisions to make that have an impact on your character or the world. the 3 starting paths are a joke. the main story is kinda ok but nothing special, was hoping for more corruption in the world, politics, interesting character stories and relationships. or at least a way to choose what kind of character i am, by making decisions, choosing my path. but there is nothing. it's just do quests for one character, than for another character and then again. you can't join a corporation and do work for them, or be involved in politics, or do quests for them, or for the military or for any faction. it's super weird. feels really weird. and johnny silverhand, most annoying character, and the character you play? he is just a empty shell. weird game and honestly didn't enjoy as much as i hoped i would. and i don't want to even start with the bugs on pc. i think some people can enjoy this game and find something they like. but for me everything is just mediocre or below mediocre and nothing really sticks out that i can hang on to."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"so there seems to be a lot of confusion around what this game is. i was almost completely ignorant of the discussion and marketing surrounding this game so i came to night city almost completely without expectations. all i knew i had been a fan of william gibson since the 90's and i just wanted the experience, all of the genre tropes, all of it. and yes, this game delivers exactly that. and it is gorgeous. i game on a fairly modest 2year old pc with a rtx2070 and i have maxed out everything but ray tracing, as to me the global illumination fits better to my vision of the genre. i have not seen a single performance issue, but have had couple weird resolution bugs which were cleared by simply reloading. i also want to underline how gorgeously the main characters are motion captured. their animations convey feeling, nervousness, boredom. at moments you can forget that it's not a cutscene, but being rendered before your eyes and you can move around. to me this game sets the bar on how a game should create an atmosphere. to me this is also the sweet spot in the openworld rpgland. it's somewhere between metro exodus and fallout  you can decide on a lot, especially on how to excatly solve the problems thrown at you, but if you're not interested in the rpgish elements, you can mostly ignore them. my rpgloving friends have described their experiences as lackluster, but again, this is closer to metro than fallout which to me is perfect. shootermechanics wise, cp2077 is at least at the mass effectlevel of fun and ease of control, but with more satisfying weaponry. the looting mechanics seem a bit rushed, but i expect the developer to almost completely overhaul the balance in future updates. the biggest disappontment has been the ai. theres practically no sense of 'danger' if you can stumble on an enemy way beyond your characters' level and just back off beyond it's preset routes and pick it off from the distance. it won't follow you or try to hide, it'll just stand there. it'll most likely take a major update to address, but it hasn't kept me from enjoying the story. tldr  if you're worried about your pc performance andor bugs, i'd encourage you to try  i had no problems beside few minor visual glitches. but check your expectations before buying. it's a beautiful city filled with stories and interesting characters first, a mediocre shooter second and a rpg third  if this is not what you're looking for, you might want to hold off from buying for now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cdpr focus a lot on the story side of the game and it shows, the main quest are good, the side quests are engaging but that's about it. thankfully by playing on pc we can talk about the content of the game rather than focusing on the abysmal console optimization attempt. but there's still bugs, more than you would expect from a modern aaa title that has promised rdr2 level of polish. everything that's hyped up by cdpr are exaggerated and doesn't really contribute to the game's quality. lifepath is one of them, not only it's disappointingly short, it doesn't really affect the story as much as they hyped it up. all you get for choosing different lifepath is just an extra dialog that doesn't affect the gameplay and nothing more. it's as deep as a puddle. that's my main grip, there's a lot more problem with this game that others have pointed out, and i agree with all of them. the ai is is more a than i, with cops spawning and multiplying literally 3 meters behind you, npcs only have one reaction to violence which is crouch in fear, cars are driving on rails with no traffic ai. character customization is too basic for an rpg game, no sliders, can't edit character post creation, can't transfer stats on fashion item. imagine being in a world that's all about making personal statement and having your character walk the world like a clown just to have good stats. inventory system and crafting system need an overhaul, currently there's no need to craft something that takes multiple hard to get parts since you get always get something better from world drops. you can carry dozens of rifles and shotguns on your pocket, this makes the stash on v's apartment and car storage irrelevant. list goes on and on, there's a lot of missing basic feature that is overlooked and bad design enough to distract you from immersing into the world. this game isn't an rpg first game that was promised by the cdpr 2 years ago, it's something else completely different. it's riding on marketing hype, with no results to show for it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"a tragic case of goodnatured ambition, or a suspiciously dodgy instance of a company trying to make a fast book. i played about 15 hours of this game and it is largely awful. you've heard it all before. it's buggy, slow, unresponsive. it looks absolutely terrible. it is barely an open world game. barely any npcs or accessible buildings. it's a giant shell , waiting to be inhabited with life. what i played of the story was good. but it is just too weighed down with the bad. worse still is how good cd projekt red had seemingly been prior to the release. they were one of the good guys. this just makes them appear like secondhand car salesmen. promises upon promises all of which have not been delivered. they have instantly destroyed years worth of good faith in a single release. they ae the new ea of gaming. i'm sure the game will get patched. but i don't think it will ever even come close to matching the promises that have been set over the last 8 years. maybe i'll pick it up in a year or two when it's on steam for a couple of . because that is all this carwreck is worth."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"yes  810 .. why not 1010? because it not perfect of course  nor is it comparable to some of the actual gems out there. story the main, the one metric ... but how good is it? i have played a few hours .. and the story is good. yes, good .. but by no means as good as say some expansions of fallout new vegas in terms of story telling and atmosphere. i would put it on par with skyrim. you are always being pushed to the main story .. and there are side missions that keep you entertained. all in all however, the whole construct plays it safe. no old world blues story on the fringe of insanity. no dead money suspensetechhorror. in fact .. it has much more in common with skyrim or gta for that matter .. not much substance to any story or character. graphics excellent .. with a few performance problems like low poly models that only switch to normal poly after too long a while and many other related problems.. sound good  but unremarkable. music and sound design cannot hold a candle compared to like vampire masquerade bloodlines. gameplay streamlined for the limited nature of consoles. i am playing on the highest difficulty .. and it is way, waay too easy. not in terms of taking damage or npcs being sponges .. but in terms of very, very predictable and simple ai. especially the ai is lacking very much  it seems at least a decade behind comparable open world titles. customization nice  cannot complain conclusion i like it. but it is no epiphany of any kind. it is not a masterpiece .. but falls more in line with the likes of fallout 4. much better than average .. but far, far from the top to become a classic. however .. there is a path open for all that  optimization  expansion dlcs both of those are very likely to come in time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,this is the best rpg that i have played since the witcher 3 and the mass effect series. so excited to see what expansions come in the future.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"edit lowered my score and added a rant after initial 50 hour review it's far too bugridden to be a 10, and even a 9 is generous in it's current state. still any game that manage to get 50 hours of playtime in it's first 3 days, without even going fully into the story, can't be described as anything but totally addictive. the bugs are all over the game.. but i don't really care about them right now. nor do i care about keanu reeves. i finally have a city to burn in my own pace and way. ..burn it nomad.. burn it  edit that were my impression after around 55 hours of playing mainly outside of the story mode. now i'm past 80 hours and just gone past the few first story missions.. and the story gets in the way of the game and my way of having fun!? it feel like i'm at a really boring job when playing.. the idiots just keeps calling and try to tell me that their mission is a lot more important than the other idiots that call, and even more important than my char being stuck with keanu reeves in my head, and sadly only slowly dying from it. it feels like the neon painted cardboard walls are about to fall down and only show me the flaws of the game the further i go. the game is not a 10, nor a 9.. it's somewhere between a 5 and a 9.. with the lowest parts being the city itself.. followed by the totally wasted npc's. they sit in a car while i'm shooting their windscreen and around their heads.. they don't even blink. dealing the final blow to their head and walking up to the next car in line.. it's just the same dead eyes. ..and then the cops show up. outside the apartment i teared up everyone with my mantisblades, the cops did a full 'agent smith' and spawned inside the person behind me. the ..texmex ..special ninja cops came flashing by.. and i managed to kill them too and hid 5 meters away. the cops totally lost sight of me.. in a damn corridor outside my own apartment?!?! seems like the trauma team have cloaking devices.. as when i turned around to loot the corpses, they were gone, but not the blood!? for a game like this to work out, it have to rely on suspension of disbelief.. when the entire house of cards falls down on you at once.. there is nothing left .. not a thing! the city is dead, and populated by dead  physics don't really apply.. if you start with that as a main setting, the game might be a full 10.. but start the story and suffer every bug there is and it's not possible to keep playing right now. the replayability is really really low, as even if going into the game with the intention to literally burn the city.. it don't really matter, you will never score the lesbian anyway! the game is so far from finished that the title could just as well be the release day"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"extremely poor optimization. core design issues that require large overhauls in order for story to work with rpg progression mechanics. as it stands cyberpunk 2077 has two good games that detract from each other, making the overall experience below average and often frustrating."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"hello everyone. this is the most ambitious game i have ever seen. the main quest super cool but side quest is the game core! i have never played so many sides since witcher 3! but...! i played on ps4 pro and the bugs, bugs and bugs... and crashed the game every 5h! wtf cd projekt red!!! i hope they will fix the issue soon and i will be more happy to play the second play through. good luck with the game and see you in night city!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the game does no live up to its hype, and certainly it's not next gen as some like to believe. i gave it 610 because of the bugs, but even if they fix everything the game is at best a 710 i'll probably change my score in a few months. pros the world is huge and nicely packed with stuff so it does not feel overcrowded. the level design is great. the story and characters are both really well done. and that's all for the good parts of the game. now for the cons the shooter mechanics are really generic. the character progression system is boring and to top it, the game is not build in a way to make you want to upgrade, just find better weapons and kill every one. the weapons are boring, only 4 ranged types, and melee blades. the guns are all the same in each type, you don't want to upgrade because at a few minutes an enemy will drop one that has higher damage than the one you spend your upgrades on. the crafting and upgrading are a  joke. the game economy . going to a weapons trader and giving enough guns to supply an army makes me only about 23k... the driving . the a.i. is one of the worst i have ever seen. the  idiotic cop spawning system. they will literally spawn right next to you even inside a small closed room. that's not a bug, they made the system like this the above are for the game without any bugs, it's just the way it is and will probably need mods to make it better. now time for the bugs. graphical bugs and glitches. too much to say here, just go to youtube and search for cyberpunk 2077 bugs compilation or cyberpunk 2077 wtf  funny moments. npc and other models disappearing or spawning out of nowhere. player dying by falling from a small object on his path. player also inside a vehicle getting launched to the sky and crashing to a stupid death. i have lost a few times on hard missions this way, really frustrating npcs stuck inside objects. npcs passing through objects or closed doors. npcs using telekinesis and holding objects in the air. if this is a feature i want it to npcs and objects hovering in the air. bugged quests, that may not be able to be completed. there are probably more, but i don't want to lose more time on this. finally the horrible performance even on pc. the game has the performance of a next gen game without the visual quality to back it up. this game has been a huge disappointment even without all the issues. after all the problems are fixed and the dlcs are out with additional content and gameplay improvements, the game may reach a 810. but it does not worth full price. wait for the price to drop bellow 40 before you buy it,"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i like this game. it is undeniably buggy but i have not experienced anything game breaking, i have been playing on version 1.04 at 60 fps at 1080p on high settings on a ryzen 5 3500x, rtx 2060 and only 8 gb of ram, my game has not crashed once and the only tweaking i did was downloading the ryzen cpu fix mod. i'm not mentioning the bad things about some game functions like ai which is not very good or the driving that actually reminds me of the wooden ass watch dogs driving because despite that i am still having a lot of fun 9 hours in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this is a fantastic game. it needs time to iron out some bugs but no big deal really, that's normal in new, large and complex games, top delivery of an exceptionally rendered immersive world. it's infuriating to see so many 1,2,3 and 4 reviews of this game by people who are psychologically children. i'm open to hearing deeper criticism, plenty of things to discuss, but how these children throw their toys out the pram based on minor issues and not receiving enlightenment and a blow job when they get the latest hyped game. the polarity of reviews shows the disparity between people who can give an even handed view on something and a growing vocal group of people morons who are in all likeliness  very unsatisfied people in all walks of life  who take it upon themselves to distort the perception of an, at the very worst average game i think it's really decent it's just a game, it's a toy, enjoy it, stop taking yourself so seriously and can you just take your bitterness away and fume alone in your dark corners please, because i want to interact with people who have more nuanced thoughtful ideas."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"a great game plagued with bugs and missing features. cyberpunk 2077 has been in development for seven years and this launch is unacceptable. cd projekt red is no different from other game companies and they have released a buggy mess. i ran into some big game breaking issues while playing the game and if you want to play this game on console i would recommend for you to wait until they release patches. the story is great and the characters are amazing and well written, however i did sort of have an issue with keanu's performance since he didn't really do his best this time. the gameplay is decent enough for it to be passable but it's not enjoyable at times since you can stick to one weapon and upgrade it so it would basically kill enemies in two hits which that isn't really balanced. another issue with this game are the missing features. you can't customize your car, no police system like gta, storylines are not different from one another, and interacting with random npcs. overall the game is a buggy missing features mess but the only thing that keeps it from getting a 510 or lower is the story, characters, and the immersion when the immersion doesn't break. the game is good when it works and that is why i think it deserves a 710."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"the visuals of this game are amazing. the storyline at the beginning is captivating and sets you up to think your heading for a real adventure. however, that's where it all stops. the rest of the game outside the prologue is very repetitive and the cracks begin to appear. the ai is terrible, worse than farcry 3 which came out over ten years ago. the police spawning system is laughable they spawn out of nowhere. your character development is nonexistent beyond the limited cosmetic changes you can make at the start, and what's worse is the constant adverts reminding you of the augmentations everyone else is enjoying around you. this game looks amazing, the storyline is interesting and probably the best i've played since detroit become human, but beyond that, it's flat. a good analogy would be as wide as the ocean but as deep as a puddle. i think this game needed a good two more years of development. it would have given them time to really make the game perfect including working on the abysmal ai and including all the features they promised in the trailers and buildup to in the game itself i'm guessing they cut a lot of content, way too many loose ends in the game and random dialogue which doesn't make sense. i think we would have forgiven them given what's happening in the world. this feels rushed and it's a real shame."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"game plays decent enough on a midhigh tier pc, but the number of bugs is overwhelming, multiple times story objectives have bugged out and required me to reload a save and replay sections. items falling through the map, npcs spawning incorrectly, missing items, missing textures. sections of the story appear to be missing as well, since choices you make have no impact at all on how the story progresses, overall a pretty middling open world game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"first of all, buggy within certain parameters at launch but nothing that can't be ironed out once the developers at cdpr work on optimisations, bug fixes and patches. i feel once these are available a lot of players will be satisfied with the game. cyberpunk 2077 is a unique and beautiful experience on almost all other levels. i personally play on a midspec pc and there is a few issues with performance however, i can't say i have ever played a perfect game at launch as a lot of new games do come with bugs or teething problems. i mean look at cold war for e.g. texture bugs, random crashesfreezes, fps drops and so on was all within the game for the first 12 weeks."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i'm writing as an avid fanboy of projekt red. i'm also aware that in this day and age relying on the developers to compensate for technology that is obsolete is not their responsibility. i own a ps4, and up until about two months ago had a very dated 1080hp tv from 2012. i changed that and bout a smart tv from sony. i realize the issues with rendering come from the fact that the programming that went into this game took some effort and were not done just by humans. as a result, we need bots to interface with the automation that goes into the display. you can't do it with a crappy 1080hp tv. get a smart tv and join the rest of us. if you can't get a ps5 which most cannot at this time. i don't have the pc version, but i'm sure you need the specs, which include similar technology i.e. display drives. i've been playing it for about a week and ran into very few issues with crashing and whatnot. it plays with no issue, non whatsover. the load time takes a while, but that's bc the board on the pc is slow. if i had a ps5 it would zip things out. display and graphics are fine, you just need to configure the settings. make sure you get a smart tv and you should not run into any issues. this will not change for any future games coming out next year either. i'm giving this game a 9. nobody deserves a 10, unless deployment is without  this has a few. it's model is gtaish, but that's arguably minimal compared to how gorgeous the rest of it is. i can't see anything wrong with this game, period."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i am very impressed and admire everything that the company has created with this game! the graphics are unusual and wonderful! drawing, movements, gestures, the reaction of the characters is impressive! separately plus for thematic music !! screenshots  that's something, but if you could still make a video  honestly  exceeded all expectations! why doesn't someone like it? haters will always find something to whine and pour dirt on. what lags, what shortcomings? i did not find anything like that in 12 hours of play. the pc is not very convenient when shooting  because you intuitively shoot where i point the weapon, but the sight is a little sideways i understand that on the consoles just like that. it is inconvenient to drive a car  very sensory control, if you change the settings of the axles  then a long mouse must drag on the targets longer. elsewhere, everything works fine maybe someone who wants to play celery  then whine  but very dissatisfied with the russian voice acting !!! i was not ready to pay for my time, in front of the monitor, in headphones, enjoying the game  to listen to that rotten bazaar and mother. developers  you are very wrong, because you did not understand the big and powerful  rosemary can be great without mats. very unpleasant  sometimes even the intonation, etc. of those speakers is not in the topic. but if the developers had an idea to cause disgust for russian speakers  then they succeeded  i hope for the possibility of changing this voice acting to an adequate one, for people, and not only for connoisseurs of bazaar, hair dryers and purulent bad breath. it's strange why they bypassed the opportunity to add ukrainian localization, because there are many voice actors in ukraine and they are much better than the russian ones you picked  despite all this, the game is a masterpiece! with your participation! thank you for the impression! change the voice acting  or add an alternative !!!  please !!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this is the turning point for this kind of stale formula i would say. we are back to square one, to the tired out of date dystopian blade runner future. the lack of vision for the future is not only stunted worldwide by utterly absent. just like the recent picard series, instead of progress, it presents us with todays culture, on steroids. people in this future have no ability to think critically instead theyre just further reacting to their childish culture of selfobsessive aesthetics, social status, massconsumption, chemical abuse, rapacity, deevolution  poverty. thats not the future. that is this current limited society  from an american perspective  as always. eurodollars is the height of cdprs imagination,  apart from purloining everlasting clichs from the last century, it really has nothing new. this will sit well with all the middle aged wage slaves who are bombarded with nostalgia every 3 minutes. oooh yes i remember that. i havent heard that in a while. that reminds me of things i already know about. the good ol days. i dont have to learn any of this im having fun yes. yeh we get it. you miss your childhood  dont know how to move on. never mind the fact that it is trite, stale  offers nothing original, innovative, experimental, or inspiring. nostalgia is a little like celebrating the ability to keep your brain the same size. the game mechanics are all there as usual. dont expect to be blown away by anything other than headshots, customization,  lacklustre upgrades. a tired old formula. made by geriatrics who are obviously still reminiscing over 80s science fiction which was never taken that seriously in the first place. the human population feels very hopeless right now. latestage capitalism has failed all but 2, weve had no social progress trapped inside the industrial revolution, biodiversity is in the gutter, ecosystems are collapsing, and the climate emergency currently threatens us with the 6th great extinction as our natural resources are squandered on military posturing. but cd project red utterly ignores all of that. because this is about going back, not forward. this is the slow crawl out of what has become a stale formulaic generation for gaming. they havent realized yet that if you give humans the ability to create a better world, they shall. instead, cdpr want to make money by pandering to their mental afflictions by building the world they want you to see, full of socialeconomic decay  priming you all to expect the very worst from the future their generation have arrogated from you in real life."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"finished the game with 2 endings. 75h in game. still have some sidequests to finish and a lot were locked due to my ingame choices and i feel like i want to play more. so how's the game? one word it's amazing. storyline is fantastic, with a lot of choices that changes the behaviour of the city. also the game did something no other game managed to when it came to few ingame choices, i sat for couple of minutes scratching my head, trying to weight what the outcomes are going to be, and how the characters i care about will be affected. truly genious design. speaking of design. design of the city is a masterpiece. seriously. richness of all the buildings, interiors, all little details in bars, clubs, hotels, penthouses, megablocks, crackhead places, guns and cars... i honestly don't know how they managed to pull off something that big, looking that good. in game graphics are very nextgen, with absolutely stunning views and moments. i spent way too long in photo mode, taking hundreds of pictures. architecture in this game, with the attention to detail is truly one in it's kind. never seeen something like this before. and probably never will. then comes the music and sounds design. now that's a treat. i don't know what kind of audio engineering sorcery was used to create inclubs sound, but they sound like actual clubs. when you walk in the club and you're in the corridor, you hear only the bass coming from the walls. it gradually changes as you walk in to the dancefloor, with all the reverb of a real dance hall, that changes as you walk on the floor, from one speaker to another. seriously, it sounds like reality. blew my mind couple of times! gunplay is great. side stories are like main story, and i strongly encourage everyone not to rush the main storyline, but to just dwelve in the heartbeat of the night city, by completing all the little side quests and contracts. they are better than most of the main storylines of other games, so yeah, just do them, trust me on this one. i'm not going to talk about bugs and glitches, as they were just funny little things, not breaking my immersion and experience. loved every second of the game. came here for fantastic story and world setting, and boy was i not disappointed! true masterpiece. thank you cdr"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i have 33 hours in the game and beaten it playing almost only main missions. the graphics are incredible and it is great to see such a beautiful game which finally brings my pc to limits where i can play it almost on the very best possible settings with over 60 fps. game contains glitches which can be seen througout the game but don't hinder the gameplay, great endings and cinematics. the game could have more choices, but there still are many amazing endings. if you don't like the current game then don't buy i, because for me it has been one of the greatest pc experiences i had this year."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"there's a plentiful number of bugs, i'll admit, but if you can look past that it's a relatively fun game with a good story and engaging characters. i was determined to hate jackie when it first came out and i found myself loving him a few hours later."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"first off, yes, there are a lot of bugs. i'm reviewing from the pc perspective which is apparently considerably more playable than consoles. cd projekt red have a ton of work ahead of them to restore the goodwill but what we have here is a timeless masterpiece wrapped in a garbage bag. i haven't been this immersed in a game since mass effect 2. i trust that cdpr will make this right and we will be enjoying cyberpunking for years to come."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"30 hours in and barely got halfway through the story, side jobs and gigs are just as good some even better as the main stuff. if it was just a linear, compressed world i would have given the game so far a 9.5, really close to a 10, but the ai just keeps reminding me how there's no perfect game out there...also experienced a really low amount of bugs tpose, can't loot some junk, dissapearing npcs through map and one bug that had me reload my last checkpoint. so far the game met my expectations, even exceeded some in regard to the world and character building. if only the npc ai and police ai were better and the performance wasn't so all over the place, i would have given this a 9.59.8. it's a 9 for now."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"48 hours in. done most of the side stuff, though apparently more pops up later after some main quest lines. done some of the main quest lines as well. i've been enjoying this game immensely for the vast majority of time. enjoyment is mostly only dropped when the framerate goes sub 30, which happens in well populated areas easily. cp2077 is immersive, which is exactly what i was hoping for. v feels like a character with real relationships with people shehe works with and meets in passing. world itself is vibrant and alive with an absolute ton of stuff to discover i was a bit apprehensive if this would actually be the case, as cp is smaller in terms of the map than tw3, but there's something to do at almost every corner. strong 910. after cdpr fixes the framerate drops, solid 1010."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"despite all of the bugs, i have a great time so far, over 30 hours into it and yet i have been exploring the city like i have never explored an open world game besides the witcher. the performance is lacking and i am sure this will be improved in the future. what is still dissapointing me is the npc and police behaviour. this is by far the biggest problem i have with all so far. you find some maelstroms in a robbery shoot at them and suddenly police spawns on you."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,game is amazing.. the really only negative thing is the obvious bugs. it should of been delayed but it is what it is. this game will be 1010 over the years as the devs work on it and will be a no mans skydestiny 2 situation where they pull it all together.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"yes the game is janky and full of bugs at the moment. i crash every 2 hours or so, however... this is one of the best games i've played in a long time. a mixture of all the best parts of deus ex, gta and watch dogs all rolled into one with a great story. it's not as long as i'd like, taken me about 50 hours to complete but i'm sure there will be some killer dlc. i'm not taking point away for bugs as cdpr have always supported their games really well post launch and i have faith that they will be resolved."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,great game a few bugs on my play through. my only complaint is how long the prologue it about 68 hours. the bugs are usually just textures dont load for 10 seconds or another common one is the drinks when they pour they pour longer than the pouring animation so the liquid keeps going after the bottle has been set down i dont think that once they have poured the bottle without that happening. just very minor annoyances but tend to be pretty funny. it is really almost impossible to have a huge open world rpg without that happening in this day and age just with the amount of code and animations and scripting that needs to be done. so bottom line is its a great game with a couple of bugs. note that the game works fine with ps4 but best with ps5 and there is quite a notable difference with the amount of stutters. hope this helps with your purchase decisions.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"dear cd project red! part 1 dear developers, i have been a fan of your robots in the company since its foundation and the first game you developed! my indignation has nothing to do with you, great fellows! you have done a huge robot that should be rewarded by evil corporates and marketers who did not give you objective terms and conditions for robots. thank you very much for your trumpets, i love you very much and wish you success! love you! strongly thank you and sincere thanks to the development team  artists  for designers  for programmers  lvl for designers and your whole team i wish you good health and happiness in the new year! part 2 warm greetings to pan adam kichinski and all corporate evil of the company! thank you for the fact that as a fan who purchased all the products you promote and as a child who rejoiced at the success of your best games, i, as the last scoundrel, demand back my funds to the account that were fraudulently received by you and your false promises. thank you for taking hours of time to get my money back from those. support that cannot answer me! thank you for a nice christmas present in the form of the much anticipated game by me after the witcher 3! thank you for sending screenshots with errors and bugs on the forums or technical support, you do not watch them safely! i wish you to experience the same when you are waiting for something with such sincerity, and you are slyly outwitted and cannot say anything in response to all the comments on your product! i wish you an honest, successful and good new year! may everything be good for you!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"first of all i have to say that i played the game on ps4. 35 hours was very tiring for me. fps problem, hangups, late loading of the skins could sometimes be annoying. however, going back to the game, i think it had a good storytelling and action. i must say that supporting the action with moving music excites me. i would also like to say that sometimes conversations are very long and tiring. generally as follows story 710 gameplay 610 action 710 music 910 night city 910 bugs 1010"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,where do i begin? i have seen most people complain about the bugs and optimization and say that besides that this is a masterpiece of a video game. no. this game is very mediocre and that is apparent especially in the second act of the game. all those different life paths? makes no difference besides each having a different intro. night city is great to look at but you can't do anything there. most interactions in nc are shallow and poorly though out. there is nothing dynamic about this game and its a completely linear experience for the most part. branching story lines based on choices? again no. even the choices you make in independent side quests have nothing to them. the side quests have a lot of heart and emotional depth but besides that nothing. the difference in endings is based on if you do some side quests and not even the outcomes or choices of that side quests but just the fact that you completed them. this is a very shallow game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"yet having a decent story with ok characters on a peculiar ambient, the number of bugs and errors this game has did it for me. the city looks dead, the ai is a complete disaster, fps rate is lower than expected, having a constant 2030 fps with a replica of the recommended specs on highmiddle graphics, textures, sometimes do not load correctly, and lastly, the dialogues are a broken mess. i wish cd projekt red fixes these errors and optimizes this game to give what people have been waiting for 8 long years."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"first of all, it's the first time that i write a review on a game. im 28, an average gamer that is now playing on shadow cloud gaming. i find it important to write my opinion about cyberpunk 2077. with all the respect i have for developers, 210 is really a punitive note addressed directly to the board of directors of cd project. but not only, the marketing and communication departments are also responsible for this failure. i bought the game on . after playing more than 15 hours taking my time, i've decided to stop to play. this a mature decision that is quite difficult to take for someone that has paid 60 eur for playing a game. 1. the game wasn't ready i need 1 year more i'll not come back on the bunch of bugs on the console versions. 2. scam of the century none of the promises of the game has been fulfilled. they are essential things missing to be at the triple aaa level. a the immersion  the story itself seems to be well written. but you need so much efforts to follow the plot. you dont feel night city, its a city without any soul. yes its beautiful but it is soooo empty. cockpit view without mirrors, no food that you can eat, no customization, no clothes. b the narrative experience good plot so far, i stopped after the apparition of john silverhead but you drown under the side quests, calls, sms from characters you don't know at all. side quests are just there to fill the game even most of them are well written dialogues are well written but are a total scam. your choices dont have any consequences on the main story. even your origin street kid, nomad ou corpo has only an impact on the first hours of gaming. c gameplay nothing original, lots of copypaste of previous aaa games. fights lack of punch, they are messy. infiltration is nonexistant. looting becomes really annoying. talent tree is just there because it was needed. to conclude, the total experience is ruined because they are so much ngatives aspect that is not worth to continue playing the game. i dont recognize cdr that created the witcher 3. i'll come back in two years and see if my review can be modified. 2 years it's long. but during that time, independent studios will maybe take their time to create a new licence that needs our support."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this game has a really immersive and beautiful world with a great story. but as many have mentioned before me, the game is ruined by the many bugs and glitches. but my biggest problem with this game is that the world feels dead. the npc's have a terrible ai and they only reply with one sentence when u talk to them. when you fight the various gangs around the city they often just stand there or crouch behind some cover, without trying to make any kind of tactical moves. you can't interact with stuff in the world except for buying and selling stuff. most of the doors are locked and the verticality isn't accessible unless you follow the story line. another problem is that the choices you make doesn't seem to affect the outcome very much. it's so sad, but when i play the game i seem to have the feeling that my actions doesn't have an impact on the world, and that's a problem with a game like this. such a shame, i'm really sad that it turned out this way"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk 2077, the most anticipated game of the year. the most hyped up game, of the decade. and most buggy mess at the start. this game had a lot of expectations. too bad in the end it fell short of those expectations. but bugs aside the story was ok at best. the gameplay was fun, but not great and i also believe they made a huge mistake keeping the story short, as it did not allow you to really bond with all the characters. things i did not like. almost no npcs you could interact with in the world itself. aside from the 5 sidequest lines, i encountered, no good police system. after you romanced your choice, no new events after that. choices did not seem to matter, until the final mission. so is this game good. hard to say it's ok, you will have fun the world looks amazing but that is about it. the world is full of npc walking around cars driving but you can't interact with them. there is one quest i remember in the beginning where you found an npc that needed your help. it was a funny quest but i never saw it again as all quests are dots on the map once you near one you get a phone call for doing that quest most of those are filler quests by simply eliminating or stealing something out of a building. it's painful writing this review as i had such high expectations. i expected more from the creators of the witcher series."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"read this if you want a genuine unbiased review of the game itself, and not of the poor performance. cyberpunk 2077 is a mixture of a handful of games, most notably fallout and deus ex human revolution. it is heavily roleplayfocused, and the developers took many creative liberties, some of which are taboo and some of which are gimmicky. if you are looking for a game to go in guns blazing, then you may want to turn around, since this is likely not for you. you are expected to be pacifistic and only fight when necessary, as you can potentially lock off plotlines otherwise or render the game too simplistic. you have the freedom to decide how deep it is you want to get involved with the world and how easy it is you want to make your experience. despite what was advertised, the game doesn't adapt to your dialogue choices. at the end of the day, you return to the main storyline without any repercussions for your decisions. you don't get punished for playing aggressively, so it is easy to rambo your way through. there is a reasonable effort to get you engaged with the story and its characters, but you usually end up staying in the spectator seat instead. the world was meticulously crafted to give you a futuristic cyberpunk experience, but it is largely underutilized outside of the main storyline. plenty of unique side missions are scattered about, but many of them have poorly scripted ai which weakens the immersion. there are tons of bugs in this game that are yet to be patched out, but are mostly minor. and unsurprisingly, this game is unoptimized and i do not recommend playing unless you have a gtx 1080 ti or better. all in all, cyberpunk 2077 is a decent experience, but a borderline 8 is the most generous rating i can give it which is primarily for the amount of content that was provided. but, that score assumes you actually have the hardware to run the game. if not, then there isn't really a proper rating to give as you wouldn't be able to even play it to give one."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i've played 61 hours of this game now and while some elements are done exceptionally well. there are lots of other key elements missing to the genre of open world rpg that even 15 year old games had. i cannot, in good conscience, give this game a good score. let's start with world interactivity. there's nothing to do in the world outside of killing gangsters and doing side missions, what's the point of putting bars and restaurants in the game if you can't sit down and get a drink, or eat meal? there aren't any minigames to do, you can't even use the shooting range at 2nd amendement!!! brain dances are a really cool concept and they missed an opportunity to turn them into something more  but didn't. there are no npcs to interact with, you can't even interact with your romance options once their questline is finished. what's the point of building a relationship with them and then just cutting it off? you should be able to have them as a companion, and to accompany you on missions, take them on dates to bars and restaurants. you could do this in gta san andreas, and that's 16 years old! there are no ways to customise character ingame or reset your attributes  it's an rpg! why isn't this in the game? there should be barbershop, tattoo parlours, and the option to change your appearance and a ripperdocs. in a world where people drastically change their appearance, the fact that you can't is mindblowing! same goes for your apartment, why they didn't include options to customize them or buy new ones, i'll never know. so much for making it in night city. npc ai is terrible across the board. in combat npcs stand there and shoot at you. they don't flank, they don't take cover. they stand there and shoot at you. driving ai is absolutely terrible, i parked my car on the sidewalk with a fraction of it overhanging on the road and the ai just queued up behind it and didn't even drive past. pedestrian ai is even worse. shoot a gun? they all synchronise and run the same direction or just squat down in the road. causing cars to pile up behind them. the police system is, well... probably the worst i've ever seen in a game. even gta 3 had a better system. commit a crime? police spawn 2 feet away from you, wherever you are, be in in the street, on top of a 10 story building or in the middle of the badlands. no police chases either, run 10 seconds down the road and you lose them. not once have i seen police actually drive their cars either. it's just terrible. the writing is strong at some points, really weak at others. life paths don't really do anything except give you some different dialogue options. the way quests are managed too with fixers ringing you up constantly is often overwhelming. not all is bad about the game though. night city itself is beautiful both visually and soundwise. guns feel awesome too, and there's a great variety. you get some pretty cool one man army feelings. cars look beautiful too, inside and out. overall, except for the world, sound and visuals. it's a pretty poor game. anthem 2.0. cdpr promised so much but delivered so little. a true disappointment."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk is a masterpiece. a mustplay for every rpg lover. nightcity is something never seen before, the attention to details is massive and every corner of the city has something to discover. the lore and the story are simply beautiful and all the dialogs have been written with extreme inspiration and intelligence. i knew since before its release that cyberpunk was seen by the mass as a different game and therefore all this negative reviews in the pc version make no sense to me. on pc the game is just stunning, there are few bugs but seen the size of the game it's normal. just think when skyrim released. cyberpunk is what all the rpg gamers where waitin for, cdpr has done another masterpiece and i am sure, they need just few more weeks to fix everything that need to be fixed. cyberpunk on pc is a must have, a game that ha a place in the hall of fame of videogames"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"okay, first of all do not think any of the negative claims regarding game breaking bugs are valid. i have played about 50 hours on my charakter and i have not encountered any game breaking bugs so far. i could complete any quest and i could do whatever i want. my game never crashed and it runs stable. people claiming that gta 5 or anything is better didnt played the game at all. this game is more like a skyrim  the main story is not all  there a many stories to be told but not in the main story. the charakters have their own stories to tell and those are amazing. and there are alot of things to do. its not a perfect game by any means but its way better than those people claim. and its sad that people who are happy dont tell you they are happy. only the haters write reviews and cry on twitter. cdpr might released the game earlie but witcher 3 was a buggy mess at launch too. today that game is one of the best games ever released. so back to cp77  yes the game has it minor bugs but in 99 of the cases those are really funny, mainly those are floating objects  phones, tablets and cars start floating from time to time. sometimes items like coffee mugs are still in the hands when they start to smoke. but the game is not a unplayable buggy mess. they can fix all of it  and they will. but unplayable is definetly not the right thing here. ea games are unplayable cause they always crash and will never be patched. this will be patched. also, some people claim that only 15 mins of the game are determend by your origin, which is mission wise true but u can solve a lot of parts in the game differently if you have the right origin. i play as nomad  so naturally my charakter understands what the badlands are and how people out there live. i can solve alot of situations without blazing revolvers just because i could use my nomad option. mission wise its not much but inside alot of other missions you can do alot of stuff. i hope some people will read this and understand that its not what alot of people claim. the majority of negative reviews are from people that love to hate and just search passionate for flaws that they think justify bad review. if you dont want to play the game yet, wait until the next several patches are out. anyone knew that this game wasnt ready and propably the devs didnt wanted to release the game yet. but money is much stronger in this world... also the sound design is amazing, the attention to detail in the world and the npcs are so much deeper than any other game... peace out."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"fantastic pice of game! as for now i didn't experience any bugs or bugs that won't let me finish something. some graphics glitches, thats all. moreover, the game is better optimized than it was announced! i predicted to hit 4550fps but it runs over 75fps. even with rt on i got more than 50fps  great job! proper hardware  no problem with gaming as it seems  main story is great so far. i feel te characters, emotions, the seriousness of actual events  it's really involving! city looks amazing, it's a little bit overwhelming at start, but complex and compelling. drive model is pretty fun, some kind of spongy, sometimes like driving on ice, bricky without feel of speed, but after all its predictive and some kinde of futuristic  acceptable in rpg game definetly not in racing game what i dislike? way too many repetitive missions with not so deep storytelling. as for rpg some quests are too linear can't eliminate target other way than designed  only one way to get to the target, rest are blocked by police cars, only effective was mele combat, even shotgun hits weaker than bare fist punch! overall it's time to continue playing..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"first of all, i'd give this game a 410 but to counter these ridiculous witcher in the future and best game of the decade 1010 ratings i have to give it a 110. the visuals are certainly nice. cdpr set a proper stage. it's the content or lack of i have a problem with. a lot of missing features you'd expect in an openworld game. especially one taking place in the future and developed by cdpr. no weapon customization despite the weapon trailer where they absolutely implied it with that disassembled gun shown. instead you get a looter shooter like borderlands. and borderlands does a way better job at that. no vehicle customization. and that in a game where you spend a big bunch of time in your vehicle. instead you can buy some  cars you never gonna use. instead  or at least a proper menu you select them from a list which doesn't even show the vehicle's stats. is it fast? is it slow? who knows. you'd have to summon it, scan it and remember the stats for all of them. but it doesn't matter anyway because they all drive as if the rear sits on oil. and let's not even mention that in the year 2077 you still have to drive while looking at a minimap. couldn't have been displayed on the street via your cybernetic implant so you could actually look at the city. also the map is way too zoomed in not adjustable so you miss turns all the time. crafting is is barely existent and pointless anyway since you gonna find a better weapon a few fights later. same goes for the clothes you wear. you just put on whatever has more armor. therefore you look like a clown most of the time. which doesn't matter anyway since you're first person all the time. the character creator at the beginning? pointless. and don't even think about customizing your character later. not available. the 3 life paths are also only there so cdpr can mention them for marketing. they only affect the first 15 min of the game. you gonna end up being a street kid no matter what. exploring the world is also very disappointing. what am i gonna find? a stress ball? an ash tray? or even a usb stick shard with a conversation's transcript of some guys i never heard of talking about their favourite laundry detergent? gone are the times of the witcher where the notes you find were actually worth reading. talking about the witcher. you remember that even tiny side missions in the witcher had the content and quality of some main missions? well, not in cyberpunk 2077. you get a phone call, go there, shoot some guy, get money. kill this, steal that, hack that. repetitive and boring. there are a handful of side missions that are worth doing but the . the technical bugs and glitches will be fixed over time i'm sure. if the basic features i expect in an open world game will be added? i doubt it. for once i break my rule of no preorder since it's cdpr and i wanted to give my support to this former great company and then this....... 2020 strikes again."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"fun game, the main story is great and the side quest are even better. the city itself is packed and vibrant, and there are many hours of content. every choice you make eventually has an outcome in the end, and i like the subtle differences what faction you choose in the beginning makes. the bugs are severely overblown, though. i run this on a system that was subpar for tech three years ago when i bought it, and it still runs this game just fine. i just feel bad for the devs. they were pressured by both stockholders and gamers to push out this game, and now these same gamers hold this game up to a gold standard and bash it for every little thing that is wrong."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"going to give it a 10 just to raise the score. the review bombing on the pc version is entirely unjustified, only fuelled by the justified outrage surrounding the last gen version. yes the game is buggy on pc too, but perfectly acceptable on launch compared to other games these days. yes, there are some missing promised features. and yes the npc ai in the open world is either really bad or entirely nonexistent, which breaks the immersion. but at the core of it theres a game with a great story, great character with great performances and beautiful world, amazing graphics and i could go on. its not a 1010, but its not the complete catastrophe that some people make it out to be either. its a flawed but great game, definitely deserving of an 8, maybe 9 even in its current state."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"it's been a while since i've seen and played a game with so much attention to detail, it's been not a few times that i've been gawking at everything, looking for easter eggs, observing the set... i've been looking for a sensation for a long time so thanks to cyberpunk i've achieved it. very good treatment by cdproject by giving us a map, an anthology etc.. the stickers that come with the game are the best quality stickers i've ever seen the game feels great, the setting is incredible, the game world is very immersive, it has a very fluid battle system and is very customizable to the type of player you are, has the best dubbing i've seen in a video game where they take care of even the nationality of the characters, something i haven't seen even in the movies, the customization is a very strong point of the game, you can tell that they have thought about the players and that they wanted us to have the best experience possible, they have also thought about the streamers and youtubers putting a mode without copyright. in short, you can see that the game is made with love and that currently is very grateful. sorry about my english. written by a ps4 player."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,this game is such trash. i'm not interested in the story at all. it doesn't draw you in. it's boring as hell. the dialogue is a joke. also you can tell this game was written in the last 3 years based on how the whole story revolves around so many women. they were so busy with strong female characters quotas that they forgot to write characters that anyone actually cares about. even with the wokeness aside the game is still trash. night city looks great good job art team! but it's lifeless. hard to describe you just need to play it. dont' tell me you can't make a good open world game with a smaller budget than gta v. watch dogs 2 was actually not that bad. much more fun being marcus than v. watch dogs 2 was woke as well but at least it was playable. so now we know cdpr has also been compromised by sjw's. it's sad because i though this company was so amazing after playing witcher 3 and the expansion blood  wine and the other one
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,can't stop digging night city. make sure you have a good graphics card though. can't wait for the free dlc!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"while having quite some bugs and cut corners, such as citizen ai, the game still delivers a very great experience. i enjoyed the core mechanics, gun play, action sequences, as well as really well written story and masterfully crafted, fleshedout characters."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"i could start this with a witty remark that for a game that had been delayed so many times, it's quite a glitchy pond to ponder at pun intended. in my twentytwo hours that i've already spent playing the game, i lost count of how many times plant life attacked my field of view, buildings failed to render or supposedly inanimate objects started levitating on their own accord  and yeah, all this happened to me despite the fact that i am a member of the pc master race that actually has some reasonable hardware. i won't, however, go into depth here, as so many have before me, may the lord bless their souls. what i really want to talk about is the year 2077, which i was promised in the game's title. in the year 1977, a child was asked how they imagine the year 2000 in their head. they replied in the year 2000, we will have all round buildings. we will have a robot teacher, a robot maid, and all workers will be robots, too. we will have a pocket computer that has everything you can name. we will even be able to push a button to get anything you want! marty bohen, aged 10, 1977  which i can't really prove to be authentic, as i've just looked it up here and took it without really giving it any thought whatsoever. when we enter the night city for the first time, it really does try to sell itself the best it could  in a way of a travelling salesman hauling kitchenware. the city presents us with flashy lights, pretty slogans, an occasional flying frying pan that we shan't ever sit in again for reasons unbeknownst. in a few hours, however, we might find out that the initial sales pitch might just have been too good and by then, we've only got what've been given  which is far less than was hinted. the night city of 2077 doesn't really look like a megalopolis of future imagined in the year 2020, but more like a mediocre city of 2020 imagined in the year 1993  hence the filler a few passages up. almost all the cars in the night city are still manually controlled with a steering wheel, you can't find a reasonable touchscreen anywhere and social media and internet are the things of a selected few. every little gimmick has their button for every single function  even in the supposedly detailed car interiors you can find one plastic button for opening the car's trunk and a different button for closing the car's trunk. dacia, lada and other lowcost car manufacturers must feel really proud to be inspiration for such a cuttingedge game. and by the way, if you ever want to connect your hightech consciousness to something, you'd better use a freaking cable with a correct connector  because god forbid there'd be a thing like bluetooth, wifi or something else that could possibly remove the necessity of direct touch. in fact, technology of the night city is a proof of a lacking imagination. in the year 1948, one george orwell wrote a book in which he accidentally predicted the technology of the year 1984 with a terrifying accuracy. he came up with colored televisions, videocallconferences and with the general infocracy that would take over the world very soon. dang it, how smart can a writer be, right? well, not the one that wrote the night city's setting. the better parts of the night city look like today's tokyo japan  or next week's kyiv ukraine. most of the night city, however, resembles a confused mishmash of everything we've already seen elsewhere. not much of the new crap, but at least some of the crappiest of the older ones we've got the backthenimaginative architecture of me, robot the 2004's movie with will smith, some weird amateur car tuning of death race the 2008's movie with jason statham and then some really dry combat gameplay employing guns and katanas from any of steven seagal's movies and i am not proud that i've seen many of them. there are no miniature combat drones that would fly to one's ears and then explode with no collateral destruction, there are no mindgames that could utilize the everpresent power of the internet connection everyone in the night city has their heads tapped into, you can't even shoot from your car  because, naturally, you got to steer your wheel with two hands  you always have to remain in your role of a rolemodel responsible driver, goddammit! role of a rolemodel. got it? nah?  instead, you have guns. like, the normal kinda guns that dudes in the us still use to reduce the number of unarmed black boys roaming the streets. cyberpunk 2077 proudly presents you with the technology of world war i we read that 'i' as one i am not trying to maka witty metaphor when i say that pistols from the supposed year 2077 look completely identical to the iconic colt 1911 made in, well, the year 1911. i mean, it is a timeless design, but come on. really?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,there is some bugs but they are not critical. various ways you can develop your character skills and the world in which there's no time to sleep are making this game 1010.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"70 hours into the game, i have barely scratched the surface of the side quests. the main quest is built on some of the side quests, and overall this is a great game. it is not without bugs collisions bugs, fights bugs, position bugs. and of course your pc needs to be a warbeast to sustain the demand. i do appreciate that many are upset, but if you are looking for a great rpg with plenty of choices and character construction, this is it. 1010 to compensate for the supernatural number of low scores who, obviously, are not expressing any constructive criticism otherwise it would have been a 7 or 810."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"one of the best videogames i've played in my almost 30 years of life, without any doubt. the graphics are fantastic, the atmosphere, the characters especially jackie, the city, the music,  i don't give the game a 10, it's due to some bugs that don't ruin the experience at all, or at least not in my case i absolutely recommend this masterpiece. i've already played almost 30 hours, and only crashed once, shortly after starting the game, but that's all. what i didn't like at all and hated it's the crime system... it doesn't make any fking sense that committing a crime in the middle of nowhere is automatically reported as a crime even if there are no witnesses  why the hell cops spawn from literally nowhere even right behind you, instead of being realistic like in gta v... why do they have cars if they don't use them to chase you after committing a crime and trying to  pedestrians dont interact with each other, they just walk, but dont interact with the environment in any  projekt you must fix that... it's ridiculous for a 2020 game...i really love the game, but you must fix these things if you wanna improve the game..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cyberpunk is not a goty, nowhere close but he is has the damn potential. first to mention that, this game right now, requires a really good pc so be aware. pros cyberpunk simply revolves around shiny nightcity and the lifehell in it. cdpr really created a perfect darkmoody city model and atmosphere that will  you right in and consume your hours just for hanging here and there. the city is really a masterpiece by it self and deserves a 10. characters and models in main and important side storylines are well crafted. they look so realistic, and believe me the romance scenes hit different in this corona situation ah the loneliness. except some of the side stories they were damn boring, the whole main and side story lines are really good. kept me interested in for whats coming next. and the choices in those journeys give you some replability options and also helps you to catch feels. talent tree allows you to either focus on certain, or go mass hybrid. which is nice. cons holy molly buggy af. like bethesda games can give the crown to the new king. rather then animation bugs, there are some bugs that screws your cars on respawn, blocks you from shooting with aim down sight or zeroes your health and keeps you alive somehow. gameplay, only the shooting part seems really good but some guns are way overpowered with their stats. even the main character's legendary weapons will look  when compared to them. melee gameplay is rubbish and has no feeling to it. crafting has no sound so becareful not to craft a dozen of shotguns, etc. car driving is a joke, like, why did you even add a break when its not even working. just let us stop by crashing. no need to keep this any longer. the game is solid 8 or maybe 7.8. its definetely a must play game, but again, not a goty, nowhere close."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"marketing material and the hype like always screwed a lot of peoples expectations and they ended up going into the game with a preconceived concept of what the game should be instead of an open mind, eager to learn what the game actually is. once you get the hang of it, which will take you a a while since its not all diced up into pretty and sterile pieces like an assassins creed, a sprawling and fascinating work will open up to you and you will end up feeling like your truly taking a part in it. the makers drew a lot of inspiration from our world today to imagine a believable world 57 years from now. from the culture to the technology, the structure of society, ideologies, all of it the game lets you live with news broadcasts, advertising and stories happening around you. sometimes its spiritual, sometimes its trashy, other times its classy or erotic and all of it has a good sense of humour. the game definitely has serious flaws however and can feel undercooked in certain areas, however these days a game being released doesnt mean its out of the oven and i am certain that cd red will fix the issues and add to the already amazing world over time. when that happens my score will go up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"most fun i have had in a offline video game since witcher 3. played 10 hours and haven't even seen the title screen yet. does the game have some problems? yes ai is lacklustre for example, but it makes up for it with the story and a beautifully crafted world! also the gameplay is imo very good and varied, especially once you level up. don't listen to the hate circle jerk and give this game a chance!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"cdpr provided us with a half cut diamond! i really love this game, it is a long time ago since i had the feeling just one more quest... and the hours run by! the core is there and on pc it is looking amazing! just a little bit of fine tuning here and there looking at you non playable bd's outside of quests and bad ai for pedestrian and cops. overall great game with potential of a masterpiece!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"this game is a fraud, and i feel for the developers who clearly have been pushed by the marketing or management to release a beta version of an open world engine as a game. i preordered and on day 1 i fell into 4 bugs and 1 crash in the first 3 missions. the graphic performance is terrible, if i run in a crowded area the faces of the npcs become triangles that takes 2 or 3 seconds to become faces. i clearly saw a traffic light go from red to green, and then back to red in a matter of 4 seconds. that's just poor design work, i understand the traffic ai and driving of npcs might be difficult to implement, but a simple cycle of a traffic light? come on. i know it's difficult, but you live in a world in which rockstar games exists, and you have to compete with that. if you can't you should take your witcher 3 engine and give geralt the cyber arms and eyes. period."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-16,"el juego tiene bugs, pero no afectan al gameplay en general. son en su gran mayora visuales. a estas alturas ya se mejoro la optimizacin en pc y con un parche especial creado por un usuario puedes mejorarla an ms. es un juego de rol antes que nada y no tanto de accin. si hay algn juego con el que debera ser comparado en mi opinin es con los fallout en 3d. jugu en la mxima dificultad del juego y an as, el juego es fcil en mi opinion. bsicamente sube la resistencia de los enemigos y a ti te hacen ms dao, pero teniendo el suficiente cuidado y paciencia, morir todo el que se te cruce. el juego durara unas 80 horas con las secundarias incluidas, las cuales son recomendables y lo ideal sera pasrtelo varias veces ms por los distintos finales y variaciones de la historia. en cuanto a la historia, el juego tiene su propia manera de expresarse. a pesar de ser un mundo tan colorido, con mucha accin, con personajes carismticos que parece que les importa ms que cualquier otra cosa su estilo y la msica chula que escuchas de fondo, la realidad es que todo est plagado de injusticia y maldad con la que intentaras combatir de forma impotente. casi todos piensan solo en si mismos y en su pellejo. no puedes confiar en nadie y te la intentarn meter doblada a diestra y siniestra. da igual las veces que te levantes y luches contra esta ciudad, est te pondr en tu lugar. recomiendo mucho leer todos los textos que encuentres y de todos los dilogos posibles, intentar actuar como realmente actuara v en los dialogos, investigar el mundo y incluso atender a las conversaciones de npcs de la calle que son a primera vista aleatorias. todos estos elementos son claves para que el juego te recompense con lore, que te ayudar a adentrarte en el mundo y la atmosfera de cyberpunk. por desgracia, nada en el juego te intenta explicar esto y solo te das cuenta cuando comparas tu experiencia con la de otros jugadores o con la de otras partidas. si no lo haces, la historia te parecer flojita y sin trasfondo, ya que el juego avanzar ms rpido, sin pararse a explicarte nada del lore del mundo o los personajes con los que tratas. en cuanto al roleo, no tienes eleccin realmente. vas a jugar como v y las elecciones que tomars en los dilogos no variarn mucho en cuanto a lo que el juego decida que tiene que sentir o hacer v en ese momento. no tienes la opcin de ser quien t quieras ser y no es recomendable intentarlo siquiera debido a lo del lore. el gameplay no es nada del otro mundo, pero est bien. a pesar de que digan que el sigilo no es bueno, a m me pareci que no se diferencia mucho de juegos como skyrim o dishonored. los enemigos son tontos y puedes conseguir algunas habilidades que te ayudan a jugar de esta manera. hay misiones especficamente diseadas para el sigilo y si quieres descubrir ms sobre este mundo, escucha las conversaciones de los enemigos. deberas jugar as cuando el juego te lo pide. adems podras descubrir algn paso secreto y recompensas, que quizs no descubras jugando de otra manera. las armas tienen una buena fsica, animaciones y sonidos, pero arruina un poco la experiencia que la ia no sea tan buena y que se frene el ritmo con una cantidad de vida exagerada de algunos enemigos. hay bastante variedad de armas y ropa. se pueden customizar y crear, pero no es necesario adentrarse en el crafteo para avanzar en el juego. el combate cuerpo a cuerpo trata bsicamente de clickear al enemigo hasta matarlo, menos en determinadas situaciones donde vas a luchar contra bosses que tambin usen armas cuerpo a cuerpo o en las peleas a puo limpio. la subida de habilidades, las mejoras con los implantes y la mejora de las caractersticas es simplemente genial, y existe un gran potencial en cuanto a la cantidad de builds que puedes crear. recomiendo el juego por su historia, su atmsfera, por sus personajes y por su rejugabilidad para ver los distintos finales y variaciones del trayecto a estos ultimos. no se merece un 10 ahora mismo, a m parecer por la ia de los npcs, ya que si se mejora, las builds que puedes crear tendran mayor peso, al igual que el crafteo de items y el gameplay sera ms intenso. las mecnicas estn bien diseadas, pero todas las herramientas que nos dan son innecesarias, ya que jugamos contra enemigos fciles de matar si tenemos la suficiente paciencia para ello. pero ni de lejos se merece una mala nota, por eso tiene un 810 segn mi criterio. y dej claro que no tengo en cuenta en mi opinin todo lo prometido por cd project ni los aos de desarrollo."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"cyberpunk is a total mixed bag for me. while it's certainly a modern marvel of art  design, it's a massive step backward in the open world rpg genre as a whole. ai is abysmal  nonexistent especially the police. outside of being a backdrop for the story, the city has nothing to offer. hacking is unfathomably boring and simple for a world that revolves around the net and netrunners. the gameplay loop gets stale after a mere few hours. outside of the main story, there's only a small hand full of decent quest lines that are interesting  95 of the side missions are mmostyle fetch quests that involve going to a location, killing 3 enemies and looting a crate. the vast majority of the npc interactions you experience in this game take place answering phone calls from strangers offering you jobs  25 text messages every few minutes asking you to buy a car that is conveniently placed in a parking lot for you to approach. it's honestly baffling how this level of quality and blatantly missing features  content  the amount of bugs has received anything higher than a 4 or a 5 from critics and the audience. this doesn't even feel like a cdpr game, let alone a deep, rich rpg that was going to set a new standard in the open world rpg genre like they had promised back in 2012 when they announced this game. such a monumental waste of an incredible ip and setting. hopefully cdpr can do what's needed to turn this mess around, although i highly doubt their investorsexecs will see the value in that. much like the corporations of night city, the deeper you look at the game and its systems, the more you realize it's a hollow shell of overhyped and underdelivered promises."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"after all of that lies from cdpr about what could we expect, constant agressive marketing of nonexistant product, receiving such a mess from the technical perspective is something that for me personally discards any reputation cdpr had, but if it was only about some technical issues i would most likely be fine with it on release. guess what, it's not... for me it feels like boring lootershooter in lifeless city, with almost no rpg elements at all your choice in 85 doesn't matter, each of the unique backgrounds have 1015mins of gameplay and don't mean anything later, except of some options in dialogs which make 0 impact, total abscence of ai, terrible physics and driving, bad combat, quite predictable heavily scripted main story it's not bad though, but definitely nothing special. besides main story which is really small by the way, and probably couple of sidequests everything else is in go there bring that or go there kill them format. i could go on for a long time, those things are just a tip of the iceberg in the ocean of cyberscam 2077"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game suffers from being rushed into release. the developers obviously cut corners to get this game out. it is hard to not consider the comments from developers and the marketing team when critiquing this game. a lot of major aspects of the game mentioned before release fell short or may have been halftruths. the game itself has many small bug issues that need to be fixed. but the major issue this game suffers from is what feels like a chopped up narrative. soon after starting the game you are shown a montage skipping over what should have been a meaningful, interesting part of the game. even with 3 different lifepath options the diversity in the stories is very limited as they all seem to merge shortly after the start of the game. the setting and gameplay mechanics are the best parts of this game. but both once again suffer from what seems like rushed development. you will get tired of trying to open doors and converse with npc's. almost every door tells you it is locked and not many npc's are able to interact with out in any meaningful way. what seemed like a huge interactive city at first, starts to look like a like a pretty picture that you can't touch. i would love to say i have confidence this game can go the way  such as no man's sky, but the commitment from the developer seems to be lacking. there seems to be a mixed message between what we hear from the marketing team and the actual developers."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"cyberpunk 2077  the crysis of 2020 playtime at the time of writing this review  35 hours my system specs on which i'm playing i processore  amd ryzen 5 1600  motherboard  msi b350m  ram  g skill ripjaws 16gb ddr4  gpu  zotac gtx 1060 6gb ddr5  ssd  samsung evo m.2 512gb  psu  coolermaster thunder 500w graphics settings  highmedium but can it run cyberpunk 2077 is the new word on the street! and i absolutely love it for what it is. it had been years since a game that pushed pc hardware to it limits, had stepped in. not only is the game a resource hound but tons of fun to play. i didn't have much hope left in aaa games  out comes cyberpunk 2077 smashing all sorrows regarding the same. if not for the graphic card swallowing visuals, there's one thing that you should play this game for  is the lore! when you think about the time cdpr has taken to make this game, it's the absolute firm base of lore that they establish for players to be in  this isn't scifi gta as many are mistaking it  it's a more detailed and vast dues ex world. just how they've done with the witcher 3  cyberpunk 2077's world creates a very strong presence and mood for the player to be in  countless times while wandering the streets of night city i forget that i'm in a for this game is that it presents the most next to possible future that mankind might eventually encounter  i've just crossed the interlude doing a mix of side quests and few main quests in between and the game boasts it's deep thoughtout world really well. they don't focus on a cliche scifi future  they present to you it's demons, it's ghosts, it's best and it's worst in so much detail and it feels so so familiar to so many elements of today that it establishes a strong sense of fear, resentment and excitement for a future that our present might lead upto. people out there might be mocking cdpr for making a game that doesn't run well on old gen consoles but cyberpunk 2077 is a game changer that many will come to love as many of them hate because the amount of time they've taken has purely gone into making a world that you relate to  can see  version of future closer to our reality. i'm from india and while taking a stroll in night city, countless times i've came across areas that resemble places that i've been in new delhi and bangalore! means somewhere there's a sense of unified vision of what a homely place in your city might look like, every area is distinct  has a different aura to it  you'll know when you're in japan town  you'll know when you're in pacifica  nothing is just duplicated around  it's a very organic handcrafted world that hate to come out of! it's hard to put down the controller once you start playing as punk of future streets! yes, the game has bugs, but nothing gamebreaking, few ones i encountered were more of skyrim types  laughandmoveon types, which will eventually get patched anyway  cdpr has been rolling out patches backtoback. it's a must play for lovers of rpgs."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have a high end pc unlike some of the delusional fan boys below who have trash setups with 2 year old hardware bragging about how much better the game runs on pc than console. no, the game has serious issues on pc too. i've encountered very few bugs, however, the game crashes frequently. after an hour or two it will crash, and then keep crashing to the point where i have to restart my pc to even load the opening cutscene without it crashing. i can only play for an hour or two before it becomes literally unplayable. open world elements are nonexistent. you can't even order a drink outside scripted side missions. the story is good but that's where the positives end. you can't do anything in this game aside from play the campaign and side missions. if cdpr was honest and advertised the game as an interactive linear story with basic shooting mechanics, i would have rated the game a 7. but instead they decided to deceive their fanbase and leave us to believe the game is a rich and deep cyberpunk experience when it's a far cry from that."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,honestly take away the bugs and glitches. the game is boring... it is one of the worst open world games i have ever played.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"first i will talk about the positive i think the story is very well done and engaging. the dialogue options are well done and people in the comments say that choices don't matter but they do! example my brother had a mission where he chose different dialogue and ended up fighting a guy. i ended up getting information which took my story in a different direction. he had to go a different route to get the information needed. yes, the overall story is essentially the same, but it does change how you play the game and how you interact with npcs. do not believe those people saying that your choices don't matter. i mean, how do you know your choices don't matter unless you are restarting every conversation. lucky for me i am comparing with someone else so i know they matter. keanu reeves is awesome. there is tons to do besides the main story. some of it is fluff, some of it actually has interesting plot. combat is fun and can be challenging i suggest you do a fair amount of side quests to level up and become a real ba. this also prolongs the main story. i feel that the environment that they created was done really well, though buggy.especially the sound design. going into bars have great ambiance and when you enter a battle the music is pretty hype. i feel they did a nice job of making the different parts of the map feel unique to represent the cultural diversity i think this game has the potential to be a 1010 or at least 910 if cd projekt red continues to release patches to fix bugs. the game is riddled with far too many bugs that range from cosmetic to making it unenjoyable to play in rare moments. sometimes npcs will randomly appear and disappear or lean against something that isn't there. when looking in the mirror my character appears bald when wearing head armor. if you are with someone during a mission and you get farther ahead of them and a door closes triggering the next sequence, in some situations they cannot catch up basically keeping the mission from continuing since you can no longer talk to them. i've had the experience of getting stuck on a wall during a fight and the experience where an enemy won't lose health. the nice thing about these bugs is i have never had a bug that an autosave was too far back that i felt upset about the bug. i save quite often, usually when i'm being stealthy or going to be doing something risky. the game autosaves on it's own quite often, more so than many other games i have played. i feel bad for cd projekt redif they had a choice i feel like they would've delayed it, but they were already scrutinized by fans quite a bitand now fans are tearing them a part for delivering them an unfinished game. this is why bethesda is taking so long on es6 and why the next mass effect will be far off after people scrutinized how unpolished andromeda was. cd projekt red is not a huge team and i think they bit off more than they can chew for the allotted time they were expected by fans to produce a game of this magnitude. they will make it right eventually and i look forward to playing future dlc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"incluso con los bugs y rendimiento que en pc no es malo pero an le falta, el nivel de detalle es enfermizo. no he visto tal nivel en otro juego la calidad grfica, cuando tienes el hardware para jugarlo, es asombrosa, de los mejores juegos que existen visualmente. la banda sonora es buensima, adems de que la historia y narrativa son del nivel de su predecesor the witcher. el gameplay es bueno, quiz nada nuevo en general pero es slido y demasiado entretenido."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the pc version has a lot of bugs.. ruining the experiece for me. terrible ia, overwelming quest system, performance issues.. i wont talk about the good aspects cause the bad ones are too relevant.."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i didn't know a thing or two about the fame time about a month before the release. so i wasn't hyped about it at all and thus had no specific expectations. i only played a pc version so my review comes from my personal experience. i don't have the newest hardware  gforce1070 and 16gb of ram  but the game runs on it more or less. it's buggy, it's unoptimized and it crashes a lot. but this game still manages to bring me a lot of joy which i so desperately need. i love the story, the writing, the characters. even the gameplay isn't too bad for my taste. that's why i rate it so high. because it's still a good game that fell victim to bad management and unrealistically high expectations. i really hope cpr patch it up, add a couple of dlcs and the game will get closer to what it was supposed to be"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the game is insanely full of bugs, the gun play is about the same level as fallout which is low, and the story plays at the speed of paint drying. i finished the game after about 8 hours and i spent most of the time waiting for npcs to walk to their point and there wasnt a way to speed it up. i gave the game 3 points because it had a story and ran even if it was at 40 fps on medium settings. overall it could be a good game in a year or two but what they released was a mess. also the ai is dumber than a brick. you can cheese every fight pixel peaking and they'll just stand there and take it. also if you use a sniper they literally just go about their day and don't even take a defensive position."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"compared to the hype the game is really bland. not the rpg i was hoping for. i don't like my main character which makes it hard to get into. the character creation is sub par compared to other rpg's, things seem lifeless and boring. it's really a big disappointment. i play on an xbox one and the graphics look like games from 7 years ago. other xbox one games of equal size and in the same genre look far better. after being excited for so long for this game it's just a massive disappointment. i really wanted to love it. way to overpromise and underdeliver cdpr."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"ok lets go, i played about 35 hours of gameplay and continue, i will analyze some details that bothers me, in a good or bad way which makes me give that note. first of all customization the customization of the game is limited to the level of the game, it seems to be incomplete, i felt that there were few tattoos and i could not change some details on the face or body and it looked very weak. second part gameplay the gameplay in some aspects seems to be broken, the evasion of the game stops you sometimes, enemies see you even though they are not facing you or on your side, it can also happen to him not see you face to face, driving seems have a little bit of input lag and its a bit stucked, sometimes you dont even feel the car ou motorbikes crashes it looks like a ps2 game, enemy hacks dont make sense, sometimes they burn you or shock you from nothing, the ai is very stupid cars stop for anything, any obstacle stops npc, during the fights, enemy stops shooting, they run into nowhere and easily fall into traps, and last the guns become obsolete very often , one level that you gain and your guns is worse than any npc. third part night city the night city is the heart of the game, you want to feel the cyberpunk night, and in fact it is beautiful, but it lacks things, the essence of the city is empty , few interesting npcs, repetitive sidequests, lack of gangs, factions, police, chaos or order, so simply the city glow is in the neon or in the millions of obscene posters or advertisements, where are the cars passing by or citizens doing interesting things? they seem to be dead, alive only by a few sidequests. fourth part quests this part was the one that hurt me the most, the main quest is uninteresting, it tries to work in a way but it can't, some npcs are captivating but it doesn't work for a long time  the reason would give spoilers  there are a lot of sidequests and this is very cool but a lot of it is repetitive, it can be very good for many but for me i played for a while and then just wanted to go out and play something else. just to finish there are other things that make you want to complain, but it doesnt help because it seems that the game is incomplete, you easily find errors or lack of polish here or there, nor do i mention the life choices that are missing in the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"started playing it day one, saw all the glitches and some of the not so polished mechanics, was kinda bummed on that but gave the game a chance and kept playing. got to a point of the story where i just couldn't stop playing, had to get days off from work to finish it and when i git to the end of the main story... let me tell it did gave me some feelings, a lot of them actually, found it very moving made me reflect on my choices, not only in the game but in my own life. don't want to spoil anything, but wasn't a happy one thats for sure. gotta thank the team in charge of the writing, because in my humble opinion it was superb, not gonna mention anything more, just let some of the bad things go, and you could be enjoying one of the best written games ever."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"despite being hyped as a leap beyond, the true nextgen game, the truth is c2077 is just ordinary. worse, it feels ropey humdrum. there's no just one more mission excitement. it didn't live in my imagination while i was away from it, either. at no point did i care about what i was doing. this is more than the bugs, of which there are many more than the performance issues cdpr's own specs sheet weeks before release told me i was above spec for 1440p ultra, whereas i actually get bad performance on 900p low more than the awful npcs, who flip between being nice as pie to outright hostile and back again. of course, there is also a ton of admirable work here. it's just been massively oversold in terms of what you'd be doing and how this world would work, and wobbles between being devoid of pleasure to be antithetical to any entertainment at all. fixers constantly interrupt you on the phone in a way that superpasses nico! let's go bowling for sheer aggravation. the menus are nonsensical, unexplained, dreadful examples of ui design don'ts. you're given big choices that turn out, when you discuss them with others, to make zero difference whatsoever. it's all so lastgen, and worse i remember having a ton of fun with, say, dxhr despite how janky and cartoonish it was  for all its problems, it succeeded in ways c2077 just doesn't. and there are so many games you can point to and say the same thing. this is very, very weak."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"cyberpunk 2077 definitely feels like a game that has been stuck in development for 7 years. cdpr somehow managed to introduce dozens of mechanics that feel incredibly nonintuitive and ultimately unfun to interact with, in the cases where you even can interact with them. it's hard to place why exactly i have no interest in continuing to play the game after barely finishing what players consider the prologue even though the game calls this act 1, but i'll do my best to explain. the game is beautiful if you have the rig to run it, and the music and sound design are superb. unfortunately, that's about where my praises for the game end. while the city is shiny and the people are pretty, you can't actually interact with any of it beyond the tools the game provides you for interaction, which amount to stabbing, shooting, or choking out people you come across. ignoring the main story and taking a stroll around town will reward you with more lifeless dolls to kill in different pretty locations, and the occasional panel on a wall to hack for money and upgrade materials. this would all be fine if this glassfilled sandbox existed to serve some amazing story or incredible gameplay, but neither of those exist. the gunplay is serviceable at best, and the story seems hackneyed and uninspired, with you literally being montaged into a situation you have no control over. seems the writers don't believe in the show, don't tell approach to storytelling. overall, i would only recommend this to people that are either looking for something to test their specs or people that are very easily satisfied with shiny things and wholesome big chungus keanu. personally, if it didn't take 8 hours to realize this game has nothing to offer i would refund it, but steam has a 2 hour window for refunds and i live in a country that doesn't value consumer rights. maybe the game will be worth playing in 1.5  2 years but as of right now it isn't worth my time."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i made an account just to review this game. i love it 1010, not even done with the story yet. the sidequests are where it's at. i haven't experienced many gamebreaking bugs but the autosave feature brings you back without any hiccups."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'll start out by saying that i'm enjoying myself and have roughly 35 hours in the game already as this is being written. it has issues and lots of bugs, the game needed at the least another year more in development. i'm honestly shocked that it was released in the state it is, it's literally apbreloaded the mmo with light rpg features. i'm playing on high settings 1440p with no raytracing. now to my main points. let me start by saying that modern hardware is essential to play this game, don't even bother if you're not on a newer pc with at least an ssdnvme, 6 core cpu, and a 2060 base edition cardamd equivalent or next gen console. this game is very poor in optimization, don't bother if you don't have the hardware. second, your character is fake you're literally just the guygirl on the box, you will never see your characters face again outside the menus. character customization shouldn't be in this game they should have taken a witcher approach with this one. however, i enjoy v his voice acting is good i just don't see the point in customization for this one. third, the combat is very difficult and rewarding. stealth gameplay especially is very fun. the melee weapons are a bit clunky but still very fun. melee combat is excellent. the hacking portion of the game is forgettable. fourth, the map itself is gorgeous and the areas are distinct. each area has its own unique enemies gangs, clothes, vehicles and fixers to work with. it's very pretty but there isn't really anything going on in the world. there are very few encounters, they are almost all marked on the map with a question mark so it's not like they're hidden. the most notable one i've had so far was a man with a robotic reproductive organ that had gone haywire who needed you to drive him to a doctor. there are some small encounters like hearing a repair man talking to a vending machine with an ai throughout the world. past this there is absolutely nothing going on in the world besides radiant quests to go shoot up gang members. fifth, the quests for the most part are very enjoyable. the main story quests so far have been action packed but with almost no existent impactful choices. this is especially disappointing as cyberpunk was marketed as an rpg think fallout 4 but far worse. the side missions or gigs are enjoyable and take your across the map for various different things. they're fun and rewarding all around. sixth, romance and sex are almost no existent. there are 8 total romances in the game most of which are gander locked limiting you to 23 at most. there are only two prostitutes in the entire game counting towards this total of 8, this is very odd as there are brothels and strip clubs everywhere. to end, its not a bad game but it really needed another year or two of development. most of the hype and the features that were supposed to be there aren't. otherwise it's still enjoyable just not what it was hyped up to be."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i expected so much more than a 25 hour story that felt so linear and easy. its ridiculous to think that this came from the same company that gave us the witcher 3. pandering to a bunch of losers that couldnt complete a sprawling rpg has given us a game that feels like a slightly better grand theft auto with a shorter story line than a call of duty game. i don't care about the bugs or performance issues. i'm just appalled to think that cdpr has become what everykne feared they would. just another game developer that care about rushing out a product for money. looking forward to watching you turn into bioware.. may as well sell yourselves to ea now. at least then in future you'll have an excuse for the trash you dump on us.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"story is great. graphics are awesome. tons of content. i'm lucky enough to not have any bad bugs or game breaking bs. some people are complaining about how your choices don't effect the game...they definitely do. maybe just play more before you comment on something you don't know. which is a major problem with todays society tbh. maybe the should be a wake up call to both devs and consumers. to devs quit lying to your investors and consumers, if you cut corners it will come back to bite you in the a ss. and to consumers, get tf off of megacorps playstation or xbox and get a computer. most people have a laptop and console. just combine that money for a gaming pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"cyberpunk 2077 is a great game, i just finished my first playthrough at about 45 hours in and there is still much to do. there are bugs, but if you can look past it you will have a good time."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this is a pretty good game compared to what i have played for the last few years, and i have played almost all games, and i can confidently say that the game shows a level above average  closer to high. and the players are to blame for the bugs, because if you hadn't rushed the developers with your whining, the game would have come out without all these problems cdprred also didn't need to publish the release date ahead of time, but basically i really liked the game  it's a breath of fresh air into the gaming industry for recent times and completing each quest i already feel that it will be a long and addictive adventure!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"aside from the crazy amount of bugs that disconnect you from the game, the graphics are amazing but somehow there are no water physics at all which seems out of place for such graphics, the story is quite good but your choices rarely have a meaningful impact on the game, the acting is mediocre, you can't talk with npcs for more than 2 sentences, there are a lot of children without parents that are indestructible and they vanish off when you enter a vehicle so that you cant run them over. main quest missions are fun, most of the side quests are also fun but the gigs that are scattered around the map are almost the same, you always go someplace and shoot some gang members. an interesting fact is that there is almost zero nudity in the game. you cant be naked outside of the inventory section, you wear underwear in first person and photo modes, there are only 2 hookers in the entire map and you cant watch the adult braindance videos you buy from vendors. but if you put all of these aside the most disappointing part is the city itself doesn't have anything to offer other than engaging in gunfights with different gangs. there is literally nothing to do if you dont want to kill people. so if you are looking for a game to shoot bad people in a visually awesome dystopian city and in the meantime experience an average story, go for it. but if you are expecting this game to be the new gta, dont get your hopes up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"played through whole thing, and i gotta tell you. damn... what a game. even though it is pretty buggy right now i can fully recomend, especially if you want an amazing and engaging story. some of the mechanics could be better, but i think that cdpr dellivered what was promised. when they fix it it will be true masterpeace."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i had fun with it, like the most fun i had with a game all year. although it was very very buggy it i never experienced anything that was annoying, more on the visual side but it reminded me of something like modded skyrim so it kinda had charm to it while being hilarious since it shouldn't be happening. frame rate wasnt really an issue it dropped a couple times near the being of playing the game i adjusted my settings and never really happened again. the game is gorgeous and im in love with the characters, every npc you meet has their own personality especially storyside quest characters. enough of jerking the game off, the game state of the the launch was horrible it blaring issues that varied from visual all the way to crashing your game multiple times. it should be better now at least it is for me. i highly recommend this game even if it requires a heavy polishing. i believe a lot of people who were looking forward to this game would fall in love with the characters and the game play too."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"actually i'll give 810 but after seeing these reviews, i don't think anyone is impartial. this game is better than all games this year, maybe it will be better than the games that will be released in the next three or four years. guys, be cool. how quickly you all forgot about the ai problems of gta v or the performance problems of witcher 3... if they released the game under the name early access, you all would like it. that's one of cd projekt red's fault. but can't they still add the features they promise? of course they can! if necessary, they can also extend the gameplay time by changing the main story. it's possible with a feature like new game or something. please don't abuse the producer's sincerity. surely, i'm definitely waiting for the cyberpunk sequel and the witcher 4! but first cd projekt red, please give goty to these people!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"there are bugs, but that doesn't take away how amazing this game is. remember witcher 3 on launch? or red dead redemption 2's pc launch? there were so many bugs, but they fixed it and now they're one of the most beloved games out there. cyberpunk will be no different. on pc, the graphics are amazing. i love the atmosphere, and the story is a solid 1010"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game us undercooked to the point that it shouldnt have ever been served up to the community in this state. doesnt matter what settings you choose, the pc version run like trash no matter what settings you choose. the only way to make it playable is turning off crowd density and all settings to low. even then, it gets massive frame drops that make driving and just walking through some areas unplayable. the story is amazing after 15 hours in, but i can barely continue with the laggy mess. will be waiting for the next patch before i even attempt playing again. gameplay is... meh. not great, not bad. besides performance issues, the biggest problem ive noticed is clunky ai. gta 3 on ps2 had better ai for gods sake..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i am on ps4 pro, which you would think this game would look decent on. preordered it the night before and played it the moment it was out only to be shocked at how lame the graphics were. even the menu upon startup looks like crap. i couldn't play the game for very long. so now i am like a lot of ppl trying to get a refund but can't get one!!! emailed cdpr and no response. psn store keeps telling me to go away cause i played the game for an hour which nullifies the refund policy. but it's like they have no clue they also say in their agreement that if the product is defected we are able to get a refund. all everyone cares about is their money but not ours!! i had little money to spend on a game at the end of the year and i chose cyberpunk. wrong choice"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'm playing pc version, and all i can say is that this is one of the best games i've ever played. i've already had more than 50 hours and i still feel i've only scratched the surface. the story is awesome and so well thought, the narrative is impressive, the atmosphere feels so inmersive, the characters are so cool... i'm just loving every second played on this game. of course it has some bugs, but nothing major. honestly i haven't got to see many graphic bugs and ia bugs lucky me, i guess. that doesn't mean that the game has to improve some things, for sure, within the next few months... and is broken in old consoles, ok, but that doesn't take away the fact that this game is huge, awesome and so fun to play. seriously, maybe cd projekt should get a good slap for releasing a broken game in consoles, but in pc is so good that i just think this whole thing of hating the game and the team is so unfair. anyways, let them fix the game in consoles, and enjoy this masterpiece in pc in the meanwhile."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,love it. it needs some work for sure but the foundation of the game rocks. story is beautiful. art is beautiful and the world is breathtaking. i'm on pc so my experience is a bit better than console.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,despite the few bugs that i have seen it's by far the best game iv played this year definitely one of my top games i recommend to play the game for yourself.this game should not be on 10 year old tech either pc is master  enjoy this game the game can only get better from this point .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"aside from the buggy performance even on pc, not to name the underwhelming performance on ps4 and xbox, i feel like a lot of potential has been left on the road by cdpr. cyberpunk is a game that wanted to be better in everything and yet, most mechanics in the game are only thought through half hearted. playing the game for like 20 hours my charakter looks like krusty the clown, because hotpants give more armor than a battlesuit from arasaka does. this makes me wonder why those policeofficers aren't beaten up by homeless people all the time. the fighting system seems plain and visionless to me. you are not allowed to lean left or right as you wish, there is no option to hide behind objects or to take cover from enemy fire. with respect to deus ex for example, battlemechanics in cyberpunk are way to arcade to be interessting beyond a few streetfights. there is just one takedown animation in cyberpunk and not even a possibility to take enemies out at once instead of grabbing them before, whereas in deux ex the game had many different animations, depending on your level of skill ingame and even took the surounding in the equasion. standing next to a door? give your enemy a headbump to the doorframe, kicking the knee to his face and finally give him a strike against his neck.... thats immersion! it portraits the technological possibility of learning fighting moves with an implant or a softwareupdate so much better and makes a ton of more fun to play. to compensate for the poor stealth mechanics, cyberpunk let's you skill for more damage made by weapons with silencers, but only if you are stealth. so when the enemy doesn't know you are there a single bullet in the head can take them out, but if they have already seen you, you need 3 magazines for a single guy od a minum of 4 headshots each. if you just want to shoot your enemies down, you will quickly find that they are eating tons of ammunition until they fall. i get that those implants and cyborgs are probably made of very strong steel and stuff.. but i dont get why people in the future are to dumb to coat their bullet with the same material. the traffic ai just does not know what to do police doesn't really care if you are going bonkers, at least if you are driving around in a car. if you are on foot there just will be 10 officers spawning arround you all of a sudden and get them holes in you i can't speak for the english version but at least in the german on some dialogues are a fair bit off? like, when you get a call to receive some reward from a fixer and you show up to them 2 minutes later and they don't know what you want from them... the story itself is okayish and told pretty good. i haven't finished it yet but i already heard from other sources that it would be to? short for a game like this. many people will say that you can play the sidequests if you are done with the mainstory or play them side by side to give you a more slow approach on the game... and that would be true if the problems i mentioned above wouldn't make them dull and repetitive as hell. in my opinion, the direction this game wants to take is a good one.. but measured on the possibilities of cyberware, netrunners and the dystopy of a world like this left tons of potential way back behind. games like deus ex or shadowrun made a better job there. if you were into those games and expect cyberpunk to have a similar approach. just wait for a new deus ex instead."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"lets forget all about promises, hype, and bugs which will most likely be fixed and focus on the game itself. cyberpunk 2077 is an rpg, but it is barely an rpg. its more of an action game with some rpg elements. as an action game the game has good, but not incredible combat, and a very solid mainstory albeit short. the few action sequences cutscenes are downright incredible, and they are something that leaves you wanting for more. the sound track is also fantastic. now as an rpg, the game has it share of problens. it fails in giving agency to a player besides given an option to do or not do something . there is no seeing how your actions affect the world in the short or long term which is important for rpgs. the characters and dialogue are very fleshed out and interesting, but there is a lack of them. that is not say that world is hollow. its the opposite, its full of lore and interesting places. problem is that this all told through text, which is something most people ignore even i. you dont stumble into situations and pretty much everything you do and resolve is given to you by the same 5 people, and in the end you dont know how you affected the world or even if you did. this leads to the world feeling somewhat empty and lonely despite it being beautifully designed and seemingly full of life. for the technical aspects that are not riddled by bugs, the ui is pretty much a mess. the quest log is confusing and often just a disorganized mess, combat often involves taking unnecessary steps to do simple stuff such as holstering a weapon, selling is often a challenge and driving is a little difficult. in the end, i think the problem was that they tried to fix problems of the witcher in a game that is not and is not supposed to be the witcher. yet, despite all of its flaws, the game is still good. i dont regret buying then game twice ps4 and stadia and would recommend it to other people. 8.5 rating. on the bright side, cdpr still has the chance to change the game and deliver a better experience. for the rant ending , has no real replay value, most clothing is lame. not a enough of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. no real companions vesides johnny and i kinda hated him. only really playable in the pc and stadia."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"o jogo possui um alguns bugs cabrososbugs de textura,mas ainda d pra jogar. a histria  longa e bem  grficos so timos ,tirando a sombra do personagem, que  muito mal feita ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"what happened cdpr? the only things that keep me playing are the characters and setting. this makes it fine, but when you go from an awesomely developed game such as the witcher 3 to this, it just seems like such as a lackluster cash grab. you mentioned and marketed that our decisions would influence so much more in the game. how you could interact with the people of night city in interesting ways thanks to an new crowd and city system. the false sense of choice in this game is what i'd expect out of something telltale would put out with the life paths being a solid 15 minutes each. not even mentioning the other decisions. heck, i even reloaded to check almost all of the dialogue options, and the npcs sometimes repeat the same reply to what i had my v say the first time. i'm playing the pc version of the game and it is still buggy. i have to save every ten minutes because i'm scared of the crashing, being stuck, or constant enemy health bar item on my screen. can't even imagine what it's like for anyone on current or lastgen consoles. why'd you have to lie when people actually trusted you to make a finished game? now you're just like the another developer andor publisher. making the people that spent money test your game, waiting for updates. didn't even preorder this ."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"ok, so im gonna start this review clarifying that im playing this game in pc. i preordered the game months ago through gog and built a pc specifically to play cyberpunk 2077, a game ive been waiting for years. ive found bugs yes, but the pc version i can say its pretty much stable and allows you to enjoy the game. ive been playing for more than 20 hours between main storyline and side quests. so far, just the story have been highly engaging. im in a point where i just want to unfold what will happen with the main character however, as a rpg ive decided to run through side quests just to level up and get the gear and weapons i want to get. there is a lot to do and the heart of the game is night city without any doubts, there is a lot to discover from the cyberpunk lore itself. its true that you dont need the side quests to make progress with the main storyline but in my personal experience with this game theres a strong bond between the characters and the city. thus, im highly inclined to discover what the city offers. my humble advice, try to play the game without comparing it with other ips, this game is unique and has its own colors. also, invest some time with side quests, you wont be disappointed."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"cp2077 tries way too hard to be edgy and cool but fails miserably on all fronts. night city is lame and its cast of characters is shallow and dull. the movement is janky as hell, all the floors and roads are perfectly flat, the action is very last gen, just poor execution all around. i'm pretty sure i selected english in the menu, but my sidekick keeps trying to speak spanish to me to confuse the hell out me while our lives are on the line. very uncool, unpolished, sjwesque tryhardfest. weak!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game is terrible. i created a metacritic account solely to write this review. bugs aside, the gameplay is trash. the ai is trash. there are so many characters that have 10 or 20 minutes or more of dialogue, some of it unskippable, and there is 0 reason to care about those characters. the actual controls are trash. the inventory management is a massive pain in ars. this. game. is. trash."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game is very immersive in the areas where you dont experience bugs or performance issues. i ran this game on a rtx 3080 and didnt have problems with performance but there were bugs. when i first started i didnt know what bugs people were talking about but later on started to experience no dialogue, people flying when you hit them and also ai becoming really stupid at times. night city is gorgeous with ray tracing and all in all its a pretty decent game with a good experience. it is just disappointing that cdproject red has had 8 years to sort this game out but still havent learnt to update old code or fix bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"save your money and wait. and if you already got  in to preorder like me, refund while there's still time like i did. this game should not have been released in this state, especially on consoles. so far it's been alright on pc but still have immersion breaking bugs. i will buy again... down the line eventually, when this game is actually ready."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"excelent game, specially if you like science fiction and rpgs, if you dont have a great pc or have an old console, wait for the upgrade and wait for goty edition like i did with the witcher."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game is so raw that even on my pc i5 8400k and 1080ti it is impossible to decide on the graphics settings, which is low, which is high, i do not see the difference.  cool plot. perfect gameplay p.s. as in gta 5."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i got an old gtx1060 and i'm loving the game. after some tweaks the game looks great and runs great at 1080p
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"it's not the game that was promised and marketed. a clear dishonest approach. i would be interested and happy with a story focused action adventure without an open world in a cyberpunk setting. but what has been marketed was and rpg game with ample amount of options and the new generation of open world, which is not this game clearly. performance problems and bugs can be solved, but even if they are solved it still won't be the game that was promised. apart from the issues, major open world misses and lack of attention to detail is taking away from the experience.  pooraverage animation quality except the major quests.  bad or lack of physics in driving, npc interactions, object interactions, collision.  bad or lack of ai in npcs in combat, npcs driving, walking etc.  terrible draw distance of lights, shadows, cars. cars, lights popping up or disappearing while you are driving even tough other big bot less complex objects like big buildings are visible in distance. there are fake cartraffic lights drawn in far distance which disappears as you drive in front of you. plain silly illusions that is not working at all. takes away so much from the experience even with a strong pc. in 2020, good graphics does not mean shader quality, reflections, rtx etc. a screenshot of the afterlife bar with a rtx 3090 might look neat but when you start interacting with that scene you would see it is lacking in terms of npc animations, interactions etc. do a quick comparison with the recent gta v expansion music locker bar less neat reflections but more refined animations, music, presentation, interactions and overall much more engaging and immersive experience."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"un excelente juego aunque an algo en bruto, es una experiencia fantstica me ha absorbido y me he inmerso en este mundo lleno de detalle y alucinante estilo. con un par de parches ms estoy seguro que ser una obra maestra del nivel de the witcher 3 sino ms hay tanto que hacer en night city, parece una ciudad orgnica hecha a mano una obra de arte . no alcanzan las palabras solo decir juguenlo!!!desde rdr 2 que no vea tanto en un juego. olvdense de cuanto dura porque eso depende de ti es una libertad nunca antes vista en un rpg sin mencionar la grandes historias que cuenta es un mundo en s mismo."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,0 why ??? simply to counter all this  review of 1010 which the game really doesn't deserve.  huge tons of bugs destroying immersion.  ia in all way completely outdated.  optimization missing and yet i have the chance to get a powerful machine. think about all medium range gamer machine barely enough powerfull to run the game.  cd projekt's lies i am so voiceless seeing all this blind gamers shouting omg the game is so good are you serious guys ? i've never seen a so much hyped and long developed game get a such an epic fail launch. and don't tell me the problem is you you were so hyped ... omg that's their garbage marketing team that create that... we can only blame them !
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i've specially registered here to say that this game is the best game i've ever played. i sympathise with people who do not have the opportunity to play on a pc or have not powerful pc. the game is amazing. thanks to all people who participated in the creation of this miracle. 12 out of 10. masterpiece.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game, oh my god! it's absolutely amazing. the story, graphics, and mainly cyberpunk is something new in game industry, i love it. sometimes little buggy tho, but it can be fixed later via updates."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"uma obra prima dos games, mas como todo mundo sabe, o game teve um lanamento conturbado e com vrios bugs, culpa dos executivos que s pensam em grana, espero q arrumem os bugs, mas tirando isso um dos melhores games da histria"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,never been a fan this games marketing by cdpr but i am an rpg fan so i held off until reports came out it wasn't bricking peoples consoles like cold war was. as an rpg the game is great with tons of lore and side missions to test out different weapons  cyberware tons of great options to choose from and i'm only 30 hours in. the story is interesting enough for character relations to be memorable but some long dialogue have me interested in spamming the skip button a few times. the game has a great sense of reward for exploring the beautiful world and i've come across tons of memorable npcs and weapons which i feel is essential for an rpg game. the replay ability is defiantly there and has me wondering what optionslore is available behind each career path. if you're a graphic snob i'd defiantly wait for next gen version or get a pc as it's not the best open world i've ever seen but it's very detailed and has you  in for hours looking around. my review isn't based on glitches and bugs since i've had the fortunate chance to play on next gen but i feel bad for those who were lied to in marketing that this game would work on current gen. based on what i've played i have faith they'll be able to come around on the major bugs of this game but people are really acting like this game is the 2020 version of no mans sky or anthem. the game actually resembles what was offered and is a single player not bound by the budget they get from live service micro transactions or the online servers being populated. every game has some issues at start just have patience.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,really enjoyed the story. even i am running the lowest graphic setting. i still played for 20 hours in two days. the story is fascinating.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,you cant sit down at any moment and play this game with a bug or glitch showing up. most of the main story is playable its when you get to side missions deep into the game that are unplayable or completely broken which cant be completed. its really a shame that this game turned out like this. great potential but no game should ship in this state. ive played alphas that are more polished than this. shame
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"after 10 hours of playing, i can see that i am dealing with a serious and mature title that i have not experienced in a long time. perfect atmosphere, great and immersive night city simulation. fantastic dialogues and texts. satisfying mechanics. mistakes happen, of course, so ... but what games do not have them?"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"first of all, i am embarrassed to be a part of this community, because of the people who sent death threats because the game got delayed, and then got refunds when the game was released because it was buggy on ps4 and xbox one. i get that they didn't show last gen gameplay off very well before release, but they're still one of the best studios out there right now, and they're making an effort. on pc, it runs fine apart from a few mildly distracting bugs. i know how insanely difficult it is to make such a huge, and ambitious game like this is. not to mention the crunch people went through to get this made and put out this early. that being said, i thoroughly enjoyed this game. as of writing this,, i have 80 hours in the game, and am 40 of the way through the story no it's not that long, i started doing side quests instead, because i didn't want to finish it yet. i love this game, and it is everything i thought it would be and more. i love the quests and side missions and gigs, and just every little bit of worldbuilding i've seen so far. i'd love to thank cd project red for putting their effort and love into the game because it really shows. if you're looking to buy this game, i recommend buying it on pc or a next gen console, or waiting for it to get patched for ps4 and xbox one"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"if they fix the bugs it could go up to a 6 maybe a 7 at best. actually making this game live up to three hype would take years and i would guess is impossible. this. ain't. it. it is not a great shooter, it's not a great stealth game, playing with a controller is janky, repetitive side missions shooting and looting will bore most of you and become a tedious grind unless you're into that and finally you can't interact with anything in the world outside of the main quest and side content. there is no replayabilty, your choices are meaningless. it is just an okay linear action game set in a beautiful world if your hardware can show you it. driving is horrible, police ai is the worst i've ever seen in a game. this game was overhyped and not worth 60. jack of all trades, master of none. releasing this game early was a corporate cash grab maybe wait a year for them to fix the bugs and get it on sale for sub 30 and i think you'll be pleased."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i can look past some bugs but what really killed the game for me was the performance issues with the game. if you dont have a beast pc you will not run this game on a stable 60fps the story is good but the game is a buggy mess and runs like
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"in the games current state i would give it a 910 but i'm going with 1010 because of all the console user review bombing. playing on a midrange pc i've had an absolutely great time with this game, yes the bugs are there and the performance isn't where it should be but i assume both those issues will be addressed within a couple months. the world design is just incredible, i often get into car crashes because i can't help but stare at the jaw dropping architecture. every single place i go in this massive world is just beautiful. the character and esthetic are also incredibly well done. the combat felt underwhelming at first but after getting some favorite weapons and buying some good cyberware, there's plenty of ways to approach a fight. cdpr has a truly special world here, the potential is just unreal. if they put in the work to address the bugsperformance, this game will be an all time favorite."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the map, graphics and the quests are what make the game shine, but thats it. the game is missing a lot of costumize contents, like changing v apparance during the game, costumize cars, buying new homes , random events and horrrible npc ai .the game have a beautiful cenrio, but it feels shallow because of the lack of interact you can make in the world"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"bugs aside, the game is stunning on high settings, but just not entertaining. it's that kind of experience, that looks good on a paper, but when you play it, it's just routine missions and dialogues, unpleasant characters, that rarely open their soul for you, and the city, where you can't even purchase food from street markets. there are a few sidequests, that made me laugh, but overall, it's just not entertaining, and you can't fix it with patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i just completed the game on hard difficulty and i was disappointed with every aspect of it. side quests are more interesting than main story line. enemies are simply stupid and act unnaturally which does not motivate you to do anything but just shoot anything that moves. i completed 50 of side quests that seemed interesting and i completed the game in 32 hours. i won't mention bugs and glitches as this is apparent on every platform. if i would not get it as a gift i would refund this game. every person who is giving this game more than 6 mark is either a bot, paid to do it or is easily amused."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"beautiful world with a complete lack of things to do in it. vendors serve no purpose, light on custimization, worst ai's, npcs have nothing really to say i could go on and on on what you cant do in this game. main story is decent and graphics are excellent but everything else lacks so hard it hurts."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"its a good game with clear weaknesses. it can no longer be considered an rpg as the player choice is very limited which is the only big thing i can really criticise in terms of the story. storynarrative experience 910 great overall storytelling as is expected from a cdpr title mainsidequests atmosphereworld immersion 1010 amazing worldbuilding looks and feels very authentic and one does easily feel truely immersed in the setting because of that. graphics 910 its a rather taxing title in terms of hardware, but that shows the details lighting effects, shadows and reflections look great even without rt and with that its simply breathtaking to look at or take screenshots in. openworldmechanics 6.5  10 the open world mechanics like 1 sideactivities feel dull and lackluster, but do exist in vast quantities to kill time. 2 npc ai is pretty bad overall inept at driving, police system does not work, suicidal pedestrians etc 3 locks big areas of the openworld unless certain quests are active gameplay mechanics 710 1 gunplaycombat they are okay, but nothing amazing, feels very rpg'y but that is to be expected from a story focussed game 2 gamebalance completely broken as of release, way too easy even on highest difficulty this might change a lot 3 lacks features to customize the pc while playing or your appartmentvehicles"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"played 86h and finished story and here's what i disliked so far main story is too short when i though i was in middle of story, i was on point of no return mission lol ai is buggeddumb, especially in stealth very few good side quests that can be found on map question marks,most of map quests are just go there, kill everyone or kill cyberpsyho and bam u did it ,after witcher 3 i'm really disappointed only 2 romances for main story is disappointment as well. completely useless v house which u can't even customize bugs, although it's not a big deal game is not challenging me at all 3rd diff level, boss fights are too easy main story is too linear, only in the end game will give us a realillusion of choice which can affect story endings killed any replayability for me because all my efforts doesn't matter at all 80 of skills are completely useless and don't make any difference at all crafting is no needed and takes too much recourses no minigames can't change hairstyle game feels rushed and lacks a lot of content, would not recommend to play without dlc or expansions."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this is the kind of game that will remain relevant for years to come. cd project red have delivered a wonderful, deep experience in a futuristic world, one that doesn't adhere to the boring, uninspired open world tropes of aaa competitors."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"when it doesn't crash when loading which is a lot, you get to experience a poorly optimised game. while pretty to look, the world feels hollow. npc dialogue and interaction is limited and the city feels very empty and pretend. police ai is woeful, popping in, poorly chasing, easy to lose. it feels very old in comparison to something with decent open world adversary ai such as mgsvtpp's enemy soldiers. character customaisation was over sold, whether directly or indirectly. it's there, it's good, but it's not amazing."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"a lot of graphical and immersion downgrades and not enough player choice in the main story when these are the things they were promoting. the combat has decent variety and features that should be in more games but it is let down by an ai that can be described as 'average' at the best of time and 'poor' at the worst. just like with the graphical polish, polish in this area is lacking. most missions if you don't care about choice are fairly interesting, and it really shows they actually put effort into them. bar some side missions expect all types of optionssettings you would find in the latest call of duty for example, to be missing. no ads toggle? no ui transparency options? really? in a game about immersion?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i hate leaving a negative review so early into such an otherwise great game, but there is a massive outstanding issue that is ruining the experience for me. npcs. this is a single player game, so npcs are crucial to the experience. when exploring the world, you're allowed to talk to any npc, but the responses are so canned, it ruins it. walk up to any npc and the responses are things like yes? hi. what, you wanna new friend? hola. yeah? whats up in the big world. watch it, you'll swallow a fly. who talks like that? there is absolutely no immersion when dealing with npcs. everyone seems to be so negative and hateful in game. add some unique and dynamic conversations with random npcs. on top of that, there's like 10 different pedestrians on the street. the reuse of assets is terrible and i keep wondering why i'm seeing the same npc i just saw 15 seconds ago after i walk a half a block away the other way from them. there is nothing dynamic or unique about npcs in this game, unless it's part of the main story. i'm really missing how dynamic, alive, and unique npcs were in rdr2. they set a high bar, and cdpr has fallen far underneath it. the repeating hello?.... gunna be long? and other 'waiting' dialog from jackie during mission choices is really annoying. these are moments where i need to take care of things and could use a quick break, it gets kinda annoying. this is one of the more annoying aspects so far. i very much wish i could play roach race on the arcades in no tell motel. i don't like the radio station selection menu. i'd like to just be able to browse through selections on the go without having to stop to pick a station."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,awesome game with flaws of course. but it deserves better than 0 and 1 from bipolar vocal minority that's why it's 10
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"wow, just wow. we have waited 8 years, 4 delays and a massive hype buildup for this? honestly just from technical perspective, this game is still in alpha and i can't go 10 meters without encountering 10 bugs. this game got delayed 4 times and what we got is a showcase of how many bugs one can fit into a single game. this may change over time, but it's still unacceptable for a game delayed that many times and promises of a relativly smooth launch. but the main problem is the core gameplay and not the bugs! let me clarify the story is linear with no decisions or consequences to your actions whatsoever they even removed the rpg tag from the description in the library, meaning you cannot be the v you wanted to be like they promised. the ending of the prologue was spoiled by the trailer, giving it no meaning and making it unimportant and forgetable, while the mid is well made and the ending is the best and most interesting part of the story. the character creation lacks any depth and is what you would expect from a game from 8 years ago, options are very similar, no real cybernetics like npcs have, options for hair is decent i guess but it's still very shallow and again not what they promised us. there is no things as barber shops, nail studios, etc. in the game meaning you can't change your appearance in the game in any way. this is a feature so many games have nowadays and they still are inept to implement it. they promised us clothes wouldn't have any stats but i have never seen the 'shoot n' loot' principle this big in any other game. basically you do your generic missions you've seen a thousand times in a thousand games, get x item with y better stat and comb through the maps side mission like a combine harvester. regarding the heavy reliance on stats leads to again, what they promised us no actual style or 'fashion of the future', this is because you always look like u fell into the basement of a painter and you just loot the stuff with the best stats and wear that and not what you would like to wear and btw there is not a single good looking headgear in this game, change my mind. remember when they said they didn't want to overwhelm us with a map full of markers with side missions? yeah guess what, they lied. again. when i first opened the map i got bombarded with yellow little piss stains on my map of 'innovative' missions to play more to that later the side missions more so the gigs are boring and repetitive. go to point x, kill y amount of z people and go to the next one, do this for 2 days straight and you maybe have half of them done. we've seen this kinda stuff a hundred times in a hundres games, and most of them still did it better than cyberpunk 2077. the ai is a joke and basically nonexistant. traffic is buggy, nonresponsive and they often block themselves, because guess what? the traffic ai ! no overtaking, no avoiding obstacles, no nothing, just cars that drive their given route and nothing more. the enemy ai just charges you with no self preservation at all leeroy jenkins would be proud. the ai is just plain dumb and has no reaction to enviroment, movement of you, your last seen position, anything really. the police is the worst in any game i have ever seen in my entire life. if you do something they spawn 2 meters behind you, don't chase you and loose you after like 10 seconds, thats it. no bounty like npcs have on them, no chase and no getting caught. it's a rushed, unfinished and irrelevant feature, that games did better 10 years ago. which lifepath you choose affects the first 10 minutes of the game and a few dialog options that's it. it's forgettable, unimportant and does not bring any replayability. your character basically always turns out to be the same. they praised this feature and i had high expectations for it but was immensly dissapointed. the minimap is zoomed in too close, meaning it is really easy to miss a turn at every intersection. when driving from point a to point b your eyes are pinned to the minimap and not on the world they designed. the length of the game is a joke. the story can be done in 12 days without trying and most of the playtime comes from mindless farming of innovative sidequests. the only good things in this game are the story, graphics and the sound while it is important to mention the copyright sound setting does not work properly. i am just impressed, that a game with so many promises and hype buildup turns out to be this repetitive, mediocre piece of garbage. it got delayed four times and it plays like a alpha version of an game from 5 years ago. my point is the game is a huge step back in gaming. if you just look at gameplay and not the story it is truly an awful game. i was hoping they would deliver us a great game with many details and depth to it but what we got is a bad gta"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i really feel like cyberpunk is a game that should not be played the same way we have played other rpg's. in spite of the bugs, and crashes, cyberpunk really is a special game of the likes we have never seen before. the longer i play cyberpunk the more i have begun to realize this, 45 hours in so far. initially i was not impressed with the graphics, or some of the mechanics involved  but again, the longer i play the more i come to realize how great they are  and why those choices were made by the devs. while the phone constantly ringing, messages, and shard system can get overwhelming, and i certainly could do without the cars for sale icons showing on the main map  i feel like having so many activities to take part in helps to build the world. if people are not reading everything, and are just powering through the quests they will not enjoy this game like those who are. i also feel like, the older, more mature people are real life, the more they will appreciate this game. the content here is very mature  and requires a certain level of imagination to understand and connect with. i am 47 years old, and i can say for certain if i had played this in my late teens or 20's i probably would not have got it, and appreciate it like i do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"good afternoon, cd progekt company. i would like to describe my feelings about the passage of your great game. let's start with the fact that the game is not only very buggy, but 720p resolution on ps 4, sorry but this is a complete trash, for playing in 2020. the credit of trust in you is lost. i play on ps4 and it feels like on ps3, the resolution causes pain in my eyes. at every step, trees jump right out of the ground, people jump at each other. as a result, i got a piece of raw  in which there is no desire to play, and dive into atmosphere. i hope that in the future you will tweak the game and bring it to an excellent quality on old consoles, otherwise it is unrealistic to play."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"wasted potential. its open world is like a beautiful plant. fun to look at but other than that, it serves no purpose. story too short. writing is average. your choices does not matter. npc interactions, ai bad. romanceable characters are good but their stories left a lot to be desired. this game needed more time in the oven."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,if you are fan of witcher 3 and you know that game in first moths gas tons of glitchs you will love that game as much as i do
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i wanted to love this game but the advertisements the false promises set up a amount of hype they could not meet the customization is bland and almost non existent they said you could be anyone do anything showed things that looked amazing and ended up not even being their the story it self is actually very solid even though opposite of what the ads said you are playing a very linear game the multiple endings work exactly the way i hoped they wouldnt barley anything you do or say matters in the end you get to pick from 6 ending literally laid out in front of you your choices dont effect the way you are treated you cant become a legend this game is a sad disappointment of what we were promised i hate to give this score but its just the way it is they released a half baked game full of lies and i will never forget what cdpr has done with this game and it will forever have them in a negative light and any future project they announce will be meet with negative optimism this is a example of what a rushed underdevelopment and over promised game looks like they have now become a fallen great and it has filled the gaming industry with shame i wish the game would have been delayed indefinitely because i had more fun imagining what the game would be then actually playing it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"ps4 pro owner. as the game goes on, more hard crashes. 5 last night in 4 hrs of play. glitches are one thing but crashes which take 5 mins each time to get back into the game ruin the experience. horribly slow inventory sales process. annoying constant callstxt from quest givers... its stressful in an experience where i dont want to be interrupted. no zen moments here but lots for the kid with add. frame refresh so low i walk into walls before boundary is loaded with graphics and suddenly an entire section appears. just clunky... almost as bad as the crashes is how many features showcased were removed. from cybernetics to weapons, stuff is missing."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"el juego es buensimo pero por la fecha que estoy haciendo esto, el juego tiene muchos bugs y ese es el principal problema que tiene y creo que es por eso que por el momento tenga una puntuacin baja. pero la verdad no tengo ganas de poner una puntuacin peor y despus volver a subirla cuando saquen los problemas que tiene. si contase los bugs, al juego le dara el mismo puntaje que tiene en este momento, 7, pero esta review la hago pensando a futuro y sin bugs. la historia est muy buena, la jugabilidad est bien, los grficos son muy buenos, el mundo es de lo mejor creado hasta la fecha y sobre todo, lo mejor son las misiones secundarias, que son muy buenas y cada una podra ser poco su propio juego. las misiones secundarias son sin duda, lo mejor del juego , como si fuese al igual que the witcher 3 que tambin tena unas misiones secundarias excelentes. si no sos una persona que no se termina las misiones secundarias de los juegos, probablemente no te vaya a gustar tanto pero an as el juego en historia lo podes jugar y est muy bueno."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"incredible game, wonderful work of art. gamers should be respectful of that. what a city they made. the game doesn't deserve the hate and the bad buzz. play it on the right hardware, cp2077 deserves to be done on the best graphic cards with rtx. don't listen to the trolls wanting to hurt the game. we have true next gen here. have fun."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,an unfinished product that was knowingly sold. after 20 hours i can only say it's not fun buggy like that and the bugs have destroyed the gaming experience. most of the promises advertised in the trailers could not be kept.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i love the game besides the numerous bugs, it has amazing graphics and the immersion in night city specially at night is superb. i play the game on a high settings pc and if you can run it on high specs and rt one it's truly beautiful. i haven't finished the game yet but the story so far has been great, i find the game to be a 1010 game after the bugs have been ironed out but since i know they will be fixed, here is my 10!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,the game is amazing in multiple ways and bad in another i was a fortunate to play the game without experiencing a game breaking bugs i encounter some minor visual bugs. let me say that this game has a lot to offer the story the side jobs everything is perfect when it comes to the writing you feel more engaged in side jobs than main mission but the writing and voice acting are so good so it keeps you busy. when it comes to combat the guns feel good to shoot them melee weapon i can't say a lot about because i havent used them that much the only thing i hate about weapons and gear is that every 5 seconds you'll find a better weapon than what you have so you spent a long time in your inventory. the skill tree is huge and you can't unlock a lot of levels in each skill or tree because the game is kinda stingy when it comes to xp so i feel it takes me for ever to level up. the npc daily routine is none existing the traffic is kinda acting weird in a lot of cases but when it comes to driving the cars feels ok and looks amazing from the outside and the inside. the atmosphere of the city is so beautiful you'll find yourself stopping every now and then to look at the amazing city especially if you have a hight end pc. if you're like me and minor bugs don't bother you that much i recommend this game for you other wise wait for more patches to com out.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i really can't for the life of me understand what they've been doing for 8 years of development? did they scrap the entire game at some point and start again, and was it a couple months ago? this is a broken, glitchy mess of course, and everybody knows that by now. but don't let that distract you from how shallow this game is. there's nothing to do. the ai is atrocious. the combat is serviceable, but boring. the dialogue is okay and the story is exciting at points, with many pseudo fallout 4esque 'choices' to make sprinkled throughout which mean very little. i see most reviewers saying you should wait until they fix the game before you buy it. i'd suggest not even doing that. the core issues within this game are not surface level graphical bugs and glitches. it's when you look a little bit deeper and see what's behind all those distractions, and that is that cd projekt red have entirely forgotten how to make an immersive game world for a player to inhabit."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"dont buy this game! i have played of 4 hours and i have never see so much bugs. i must so many load the quests again and i have many crashed. the problem is, i can't receive my money back. steam say, i have to much playtime of this shi game! sorry but this game is not final and beta, it is a alpha!!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"yes, the game has some bugs, but nothing major or gamebreaking. i played 20 hours and it just crashed twice on my pc, which is really fine. pros the game is actually great with a very interesting storyline. the quest design is just perfect, it could end in different ways. i like the customization that you can do to your body and the skills tree. night city is probably the best city in an openworld game, the atmosphere is just incredible and the soundtrack is topnotch. cons the game lacks sometimes in ai, especially in police chases, but i think its minor and they can fix it with an update. i would also like to see more shops in the city like a barber shop, but i am sure they will add it later just like in the witcher 3. conclusion all in all i would give it 1010 because all the cons the game has are small and fixable. while the pros of the game are so strong to give you a great experience on pc. i am sure this game will age like fine wine."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"revised there are a lot of new accounts rating this game. which should be handled by a timegate on new accounts reviewing products. but on to my review. im running through the streets with a katana. i cant hack people at the moment, the civilians. im not sure that i can. story reminds me of other games ive played. the graphics are on par with other titles. there are extras here and there. well start with the graphics which are maxed on my machine. im seeing around 30fps. my cyberdeck is old. im running an nvidia 1060. im going to assume the issues ppl have are drivers, newer graphics cards, consoles, or confusion. but there is the configuration file issue. google it. graphics and system ram are vastly underrepresented in the file. i only got about 5 extra frames a second from changing values. one thing that isnt good is the fact that you cant use 3rd person point of view. story is entertaining and there are a lot of side quests. i dont think you can go off script during a mission because there are doors that block you. but thats the majority of games. there are usually only two ways to handle a situation. brute force or paragon. like many games before it, if you have the skill you can get more experience out of the mission with skill checks. extras like tv in game are limited. been nice if they would have linked to youtube or something like letting you browse the net in game. there is a gta style intranet. driving is fun and the cars have fully detailed interiors. there are some scripted driving sequences. guns are fun and you can practice the 2nd amendment. weird coming from a polish company. think call of duty like everyone else has said. lots of mods. the cyber stuff reminds me of system shock 2 or e.y.e cybermancy. you also have lots of mods. you get bullet time while hacking stuff. if you like games such as watchdogs and e.y.e cybermancy youll probably like this eventually when they get all the other parts in. its a nomanssky base game at the moment. they should post a roadmap because like many have said, its not a finished product. its no 10 but its no 0."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"very good writing and incredible city of an unprecedented scale. best cdpr gameplay to date as well. gunplay and movement are pretty decent while also not forcing you into shooting everything due to hacking and stealth abilities. i'm not giving 1010 because the game currently has performance, bug and ai issues. also, i find strange that it lacks features present in the witcher 3 such as an equivalent to gwent or the ability to change your hairstyle  cosmetics. in general i think it needs many quality of life features dresser, inventory management, car selling, apartments.... hoping cdpr will patch them in."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'm sorry, but this game it's an ambush, if you have to give this final product, please just don't release it, and dont make excuses, that a lineal game it's more easier to make, because you have the mirror of red dead redemption 2 to compare, if you make a game for pc gamers, ok its fine, but dont cut the reviews from console players, again this game its an ambush, please dont buy it the firts 6 months, buy it when its with 80 off,..... again ambush!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game keeps you engaged and interested from the beginning until the very end. combat is great, especially silent assassinations are good my preferred role. rpg and item systems are great, you always have something to upgrade. what bothered me is a lot of not interestingvaluable information from 90 of flash disks, and also some minor bugs, which obviously didn't affect gameplay and will be fixed soon, major thanks to cdpr and special thanks keanu. great game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"nice game. it is not goat, it is not best in technology aspects. but it is still great game with several minor bugs. i don't understand all hate."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"one of the best games i have ever played. there are some glitches and performance issues but that's to be expected on a game at this scale and ambitious. the world looks amazing with ray tracing enabled and feels like you're actually in the game. satisfying gun play, driving and moment to moment story lines are well written. a true next gen game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"great game for me! i played on the imac through bootcamp and didn't see many bugs. everything i saw made me smile, but i've been playing since 1995 and i've seen worse things before  really guys, let's wait for the patches and personally i'm going to rerun this game on ps5. this time i completed the game in 5 days, completed quests with silverhand and panam. and if i thought before these quests that the score fluctuates around 7, the story with jackie did not impress me too misunderstood, then silverhand turned out to be an interesting man, and the panam literally made me fall in love with her. honestly, she literally showed me exactly my dreams, and my heart burned as in my youth. this is the best thing that has happened to me in recent years! this is not an attraction to her forms, as is usually the case with female characters in games, this is a real love and i will definitely return to her  from the bottom of my heart, many thanks to the developers for these wonderful moments! otherwise, the game is interesting, good, i'm waiting for additions!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,this game is just really bad. i'm shocked that they lie this much to us all. world design is really top notch and characters are well written. but that's just it. they lied straight to our faces about the features in this mess. i don't even wanna waste my time counting all the issues with this game. this was my first ever preorder and this is how it turned out to be.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'm giving this an 8 based solely on the game itself, that is to say without considering the bugs and technical issues. i didn't encounter many personally, but it's been terrible for some people, especially on consoles. if i did take those issues into consideration, this would be closer to a 610, but hopefully cdpr will patch these out eventually and deliver a better experience for all. cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty good game thanks to its great cast of characters, fantastic narrative, and extremely fun gameplay systems. it also functions as a great rpg, offering many interesting choices and side missions along the way although i do agree that it does start out pretty slow. not to mention how they absolutely nailed the layout and visuals of night city itself! don't let the anger albeit somewhat justified, considering how they just overhyped the hell out of this game fool you. this is a fantastic game with lots of quality content within it. i'd also like to point out that, despite my frustrations in the next paragraph, there are some pretty cool chance encounters and oddities to stumble upon throughout the city funny conversations, gang shootouts, npcs playing music or preaching, etc. where this game fails for me is ai behaviour and the promises of a living, breathing open world. night city may be fun to navigate and it's very easy to get lost in all the neon lights and just the general vibe, but it certainly doesn't feel alive. it feels a lot closer to novigrad from the witcher 3, but that doesn't work as well here since the open world seems to be taking more notes from games like gta 5 or at least, trying to. not to mention how the ai just doesn't do... well anything. they drive in straight lines and only walk or run away when you shoot. finally, the police system is genuinely one of the worst i've ever seen in a game like this. they just spawn around you the second you commit a crime! this aspect of the game absolutely needs to be reworked. i'd also like to mention how the driving, although fun and functional, can leave a lot to be desired in terms of responsive, despite how cool a lot of the vehicles are. there are also a lot of qol issues that need to be addressed crouch button is also skip button, map doesn't zoom out when driving fast, no drag and drop, can't close map by pressing map button, etc. all in all, a pretty fun game being pulled down by severe technical issues and excessive hype. if you're still not sure about this game, are playing on lowerend consoles, or really do mind the current jankiness, hold out for 23 more months. otherwise, there's no reason not to give this game a shot, it's simply a great time!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"buggy and with underdevelopedunbalanced game systems, this game is fun, but broken. and it's definitely not an rpg. certain skills, like cold blood, engineering, and athletics are either obfuscated or completely unbalanced. it took hours of experimentation and online investigation to figure out, for example, that cold blood requires a perk to increase its xp the only skill requiring a perk, but also that activating the perk isn't enough, you have to kill enemies while the perk is active. using tech weapons is supposed to increase engineering xp, but it turns out you only get the engineering xp if you shoot enemies through walls. kind of an important caveat. athletics is not balanced to gameplay at all. the skill description says running, jumping, etc will increase your xp, but this is a lie. athletics xp gain is tied to stamina drain, which is an important distinction since many skills reduce or remove stamina usage, making the already abysmally low rate of athletics skill gain entirely null. this is just bad design. i had to set up an autoclicker to let my character jump for 9 hours straight, to drain enough stamina to only gain 3 levels in athletics. that is on top of the 12 hours i've spent actually playing the game, running around, etc. somebody somewhere had to move a decimal point, because it's not right. speaking of bad design, this game was heavily, heavily marketed as an rpg. it was based on a tabletop rpg. this game is not an rpg, which i would have known had i been following cyberpunk news closely, as apparently they stealthily switched the description a while back to actionadventure. just one aspect of the gross, deceptive marketing cdpr used for this game. they deliberately hid the poor performance on consoles by disallowing review copies. they also knew how buggy and unpolished the game was prior to release, which is why they only let reviewers use broll and trailer footage in their reviews. a lot of folks have reported a lot of bugs. the majority i've run into have been floating objects or dropped items clipping into the ground and becoming impossible to collect. not that i need to, because there is already way too much in the world to collect. this game has one of those lootershooter loot system designs. the kinds with hundreds of identical weapons that get eversoslightly, incrementally better as you increase in level. i hate this type of game. i'm definitely of the camp that likes weapon systems in games like dark souls or fallout 4. these games have a variety of weapons, but the weapons have unique move sets or abilities and can be improved over time. it is a system that gives meaning to choice and to play style, an aspect of rpgs. cyberpunk does have a crafting system, but it's largely useless for upgrading your gear. this is another part of the game that just doesn't feel balanced at all. the investment of resources into upgrading weapons is so heavy, especially if the weapons are legendary and require legendary components, that you're better off just waiting a few levels and either finding a new weapon, or crafting one if you're lucky enough to have found a crafting schematic. and really, you can only craft those good weapons if you've heavily invested permanently allocated attribute points into technical skill so you can buy the required perks. the investment just isn't worth it, which is an aspect that just casts a pall over the whole experience. i've had to give up on even pretending this is a role playing game. you get a character creator in this game because it checks off a box that idiots like me look for when purchasing a game. i spent hours obsessing over which start i should pick, wondering how it would affect the game. it didn't. character origins basically give you a few extra dialogue choices, but i have seen no impact on game play. most of the nomad dialogue choices i've made have basically boiled down to my character saying i'm a nomad, i can help you out with this, and the npc responding no, thanks. sweet. and this brings me back to the loot system, which adds extra salt to the wounds. i wanted to make a cool nomad merc, but because i'm lacking the components and level to upgrade the cool legendary armor i found, my coolunderpressure nomad solo is wearing a woman's kimono top and cutoff shorts, because their armor rating is like double my legendary, unique rockerboy's vest. i hate this. i wanted to experience the world of cyberpunk. my friends are in to tabletop games, but not really the genre. i thought this game would be a way to do so. the world is empty, with no interactions possible outside of driving, killing, and shopping. in a way, i guess that's what the world of cyberpunk is supposed to be, but it wouldn't have killed them to throw in some mini games or something. night city is beautiful, but i prefer yakuza 0's kamurocho. cyberpunk 2077 shines in its characters, quests, and art direction. otherwise, it's skippable. 510."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"had very little expectations going into it, was just excited about the world of cyberpunk. very happy with what i got, quite a few bugs but nothing gamebreaking for me. once those are fixed it'll be a fantastic game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"well... about 20 hours into the game... here is my thoughts ... story  910 i am really enjoying the story, i think this is where the experience shines, much attention to detail went into these characters and fleshing them out, however i do feel like there is some things missed by not having the starting choices really effect your outcome aside from some different dialog choices under that starting point, as well as clothes etc.. but i could be wrong here, that's just what i have witnessed so far 20 hours in. graphics  810 i think the graphics are stellar but i do feel that this may be the new crysis for the rtx cards, i have a 2070 rtx and i can't even get 60 fps with ray tracing disabled and dlss disabled.. i have to at least put dlss to auto or quality to get 5060fps .. so perhaps some optimizing is required here.. but overall i have seen this game on full, and its breathtaking.. for me it loses some points because even with ray tracing off i can't really play a solid 60fps with dlss turned off. controls  710 i think these could be fleshed out more, we need a walk function... driving could be tightened up ... there's a few things here, gets a 7 from me... artificial intelligence  610 i think some things are broken here, mainly... police... they are just absolutely busted, they don't chase you like in gtav, they simply just spawn out of thin air and start attacking you, and sometimes when you don't even provoke it, they come in for the kill... this needs to be hugely tightened up .. but for the most part ... if you avoid crimes... you'll be ok. overall score  710 with its current version, and the amount of glitches i have experienced, although the game is overall fun and i am having a blast with it ! the bugs are immersion breaking... and they need to be fixed and sorted... and the game better optimized, i am excited to see what the developer does in january  february as promised .. and where they end up , i will change my review at that point and update it. ! but for now.. ill keep enjoying what i can play now."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"it's awesome. the combat is so much fun and gets super intense. there are a ton of ways to go about taking down enemies as well. like a mix of mechanics from watch dogs, ac, and the gunplay feels similar to gta v and far cry 5 mixed with a little battlefield. the writing is really good and the characters are interesting and some even memorable. there are a bunch of different ways to complete quests. go stealthy with a silenced pistol, take down their networks and hack enemies, guns blazing, fists only, katana only, etc. character customization is fairly basic with no sliders, but wasn't bothered much by it. the skill trees are very organized and offer a lot of avenues to tweak your v. my only gripes are that the performance is so bad unless you tweak a bunch of things in the files. a couple bugs like a floating car nothing immersion breaking and one crash so far after loading a save after dying. but so far it's been a great game. maybe wait a month or so so that the kinks get ironed out on pc. once they get the performance and bugs settled it's definitely a 1010 for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the game is really great. i have played for 10 hours already. the story is 10 out of 10. i think people that put a low rating to this game simply havent played enough. the scenario will definitely get a lot of awards in 2021. in addition to great story, there is a fantastic picture and awesome game design. everything you see on a screen is brilliant here. fantastic immersive dialogs, where you can freely move your camera. dialogs, design, cast, voice. this game is more like interactive movie. the game is huge. ibe played for 10 hours and i think i am about 10 of story. the game is so rich and have so many different mechanics hacking and cyberdecks, braindancing which is like a mini detective quest, second vision is a real silver bullet of any cyberpunk, body implants, crafting and resources. action part is not ideal is not a strong part of the game. but this is normal for storybased arpg. and the choice of weapons is huge, which is good. many people write bad review based on two reasons glitches which is normal for day 1, they all will be solved taking into account cdpr team size, and bad performance on old consoles cmon, this consoles were made 7 years ago, just grab a new one or a pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,blade runner in video game world!!! enjoy this game. people's talking about this game in future
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"as someone who loves rpgs and shooters, this was a game i was very excited for, i was not thinking it was gonna be some life changing experience, but i did still expect more than what i got for 60. i will start by saying the games graphics are top of the line, basically nothing better. however graphics are definitely not everything and while i enjoy the story i do think it is not game changing or anything too crazy its just ok. the characters can be amazing at times though and some of the side stories are better than the main questline imo. the game still has plenty of jank feeling mechanics. the animations and ai for example are sometimes atrocious. the physics are a joke honestly and a lot of the stats for leveling are practically just plus 3 attack with this weapon. i would basically say cyberpunk is an rpglite not very deep at all. there's lots of customization you can do, but much of it fells kind of pointless and not very impactful whatsoever. driving is rather boring and the wanted system is practically shoved in with no thought. i do think this game has a lot going for it but also a lot that just makes it very last gen feeling, which is kind of ironic with how terrible it runs on last gen consoles. i did experience many many bugs in my 45 hours so far. i did a decent chunk of side missions, including all the major ones and have had to reload on 5 occasions to an old save losing progress because the game completely bugged out. once during a mission i got into a car as i was told, but instead of actually getting in i just kind of stood there and then the car drove away along with the rest of the mission leaving me stranded in an area where i couldn't actually do anything as i was, lets just say, in a heavily scripted story mission. during the final mission i came out of a sort of cutscene and was just stuck staring at some untextured wall not able to do anything even though in the corner my character was moving on the map. i fell through the map in my car on one occasion and during one cutscene i spawned inside of the side quest npc in the car and my game ended up crashing which only happened i think twice. the game also doesn't run too great for me although i'm sure that might be worked on it's just a little stupid for it to be in this condition at launch. i also have to say i'm super disappointed in the way cdpr has handled this launch on all platforms, i think it's been a complete mess and definitely needs some fixing otherwise i don't know how fast i'll be in supporting this company in the future."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"first impression  very avarge, second impression  well kinda boring. right now i would say its 1 of best games ever made. awsome graphics ultra  rt, nice atmosphere of city, people on streets you can interact with, almost you can feel those npcs are real players. very nice storyline, lots of additional quests, player has choice in order, you can rush with main storyline, or you can focus on side quests first. game has some bugs but them dont affect on gameplay itself, imo bugs are not irritating, more funny i would say. i would say games is strong 810 but there's a lot of sadboi's giving 0, disappointed because game in their head was differentbetter? than cdpr's game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"not any optimization, continuous bugs and errors! awful viewing angle like in doom !!!! i suffered for an hour in this .... return my money !!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"great game, running on nvidia gtx 1070 and intel i5. runs fine with alittle overclocking. i think its a great game, with a few issues. giving time, i think this will be one too remember. try living the story and feeling something. i guess thats all i can say... great game, good story, gripping self reflection. cyberpunks combat, mad me feel like a fricken superhero, crazy rush, heart pumping music good times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,everything is fine in the game except optimization. the main story of the game is short in my opinion. it is very bad and sad that the game comes out with extreme errors and victimizes ps4 and xbox one users. cdpr shouldn't have kept this. either the game shouldn't have rolled out to older platforms or it should have been delayed for older platforms. also the game engine has been optimized for intel cpus on pc. fine tuning is required for amd ryzen processors.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,the story is quite decent not really engaging and i rarely feel in control. however the world is quite full. lots of content even if i feels stale. very buggy. combat feels stale .

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"unplayable. shame for the company and, more important, thid is a fraud, if you can get your money back, do it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the pc version of this game is leagues more playable than the base console versions, specifically referring to general stability and graphics. however, there are still an insane amount of bugs, from glitchy npc models and cars to broken areas, doors not opening that will soft lock your game etc. it is also important to note that in all versions of the game, mechanics and features stated by the developers to be in the game are missing, so are some basic rpg mechanics. for example, you cannot customise your character outside of equipping stat based gear, there is no transmog feature for this, so if you want to max your characters stat potential, expect to not look the way you want. there is also no vehicle customisation and very limited, if not non existent open world activities to take part in. there are some things you can do outside of the main missions, such as ncpd activities that always require you to eliminate the enemies in an area, no objective diversity here. ultimately, the sprawling, groundbreaking rpg world you were promised prior to release is little more than a linear story with a superficial open area to move around in. some of the biggest disappointments in this game come from the ai, the npcs dont get their own lives or routines as stated by the devs before release. they only exist when you are looking, like, actually. they dont do anything other than walk around or participate in one looping animation, such as harassing a vending machine for example. in some instance turning around will simply result in all npcs in your line of sight being replaced with new ones or disappearing entirely. speaking to an npc will result in a one sentence response that will occur infinitely with no variation. there is also little to no police ai. if you compare this game to other open world rpgs, such as those from r you really start to see where this game falls flat. there is no lasting crime system. committing any crime, in any area, even in those usually inaccessible by npcs or those stated by the game itself as outside police jurisdiction will result in the police spawning behind the player and immediately attacking them with a 14  level of intensity. you can remove this by driving away from the police for a short distance as they have not implemented the ability for the police to drive. on the topic of vehicles for npcs, the same despawning issue is present here as well as lack of any reaction to your actions from the npcs on the roads, they will not drive around any obstructions and in some areas of the world can be seen crashing into the same corners or obstacles due to poor pathing. the life paths that were announced during development that were said to have an affect on gameplay are still present in the form of around 20 minute first missions that ultimately only lead to a short montage showing the interesting parts of night city before all 3 pathways converge on the same storyline, a far cry from the varying roleplaying aspects we were told and expecting from this feature. you do get an extra dialogue option based on your life path choice every so often, but like most of the base dialogue options, they dont have any bearing on the outcome of the conversation the majority of the time. in conclusion, choice, activities, customisation and immersion are very limited in its current state and definitely not what most people were expecting from a cdpr game many years in development. hopefully the team is able to reflect on the issues the community are having regarding bugs and overall gameplay and can implement fixes for the majority of them. it does need to be noted that whilst bugs and optimisation may see fixes implemented as soon as january and february according to the devs themselves, larger issues such as the lack of variety with the npc's, police and ai issues may take much longer to resolve, if they're not entirely unfixable without an total rework. tldr if you had expectations for this game based on what you saw, heard or read prior to release, save your money for now, especially if you're on console. if you are happy with a well made, cinematic main story set in 2076 according to the phones of the street npcs, another oversight by the design team this may be worth picking up on sale, but in its current state, this is certainly not the immersive, cyberpunk rpg experience we were promised."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the thing about this game is that... it wasnt tested by anyone before launching. there are so many things that you look for the first time and can say it shouldnt be tthis way, the minimap, the sensibility on the car, the choice of fixed aa, the way the character follows an npc in a cutscene, the delay you get in some actions, the transition for fps to tps in the car, the customization being inexistent in a rpg, the lack of variet in the guns ion a futuristic scenario where you can get about anything, the lifeless npcs, the lack of dialogue in car trips look at how good it is on gta v a game from 2013. all this things together with all the lies about things you could have done in the game pack up in a  gameplay in a lifeless city with the non relatable characters that appear for 10 sec in each mission it turned the game that was supposed to be revolutionary in a piece of generic junk"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"!!!warning!!! do not buy this game on last gen consols yet!!! in it's current state it's not the same thing as the pc version!!! if your pc meets any of the requirements get it on pc!!! with that out of the way , i'm not sure there is any other game i can recommend as much as cyberpunk 2077 on the pc, even if it's not a high end one , it will run it alright. the game is well optimized on pc as far as i'm concerned. cdpr kept their promise, and delivered a truly breathtaking experience that grabs you right by the throat and doesn't let you go till the very end! the story in this game is something that will never be forgotten once you've truly been through it, and i truly believe it will be talked about for many many years to come. night city is it's own character, it is living and breathing and i've never felt so immersed in any other fictional world ever before... there simply are no words for the feelings this game has evoked in me. cyberpunk is absolutely gorgeous and pleasing to look at and i simply could not take my eyes off it. high settings , 1080p on pc the gameplay is great and fluent as can be expected and the sound design and music pushes the immersion and sheer enjoyment to a whole new level. the rpg systems implemented are very much indepth and interesting, encouraging a lot of replayability. the content in this game just seems never ending , there is always more to do and it's truly seen how much time and hard work truly went into every single quest, sidequest and sideactivity. ... now yes the game has bugs and glitches, some of them more noticable some of them less, and yes they sadly do have the potential to retract from the experience. thankfully during my playtime so far i didn't encounter any bad ones, but i know some people did. for them i am whole heartedly sorry. still i'm sure that cdpr is working relentlessly to fix all the problems and i'm sure they will. give them time , don't condemn the game or the company. i'm looking forward to future updates and hotfixes drastically improving the game. simply put , i am absolutely in love with this game and i can whole heartedly say that it delivered on my expectations, in some things even surpassed them.in the story. it has problems and little annoyances e.g. some quality of life features missing but honestly for me they weren't enough to worsen my experience by any stretch. 9.8  10"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"marvels avengers is a better fleshed out game than cyberpunk 2077 will ever be, even if cdpr gets to make the game at least playable. its problems go far beyond being a buggy mess the game mechanics are outdated, the a.i. is laughably bad and the open world is not even close to what gtav or any other open world aaa game of the last 7 years, and it becomes even worse when you compare with something like rdrii. if anything, this proves that review scores and press reviews are fundamentally broken in 2020 avengers got trashed for having some mild bugs, despite having excellent and deep gameplay mechanics throughout 6 playable characters, an excellent campaign mode and an enjoyable albeit repetitive multiplayer mode. how that game sits at 68 while cyberpunk 2077 is at 89 is ridiculous, and proof that not just cdpr, but game criticism needs to get a lot better."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"firstly i love the cyberpunk genre, so that could be clouding my judgement here, but here's my general breakdown. also, this review comes with about 30 hours of gameplay, but i haven't finished it yet as it's massive. technical let's be honest, i played this game on pc, and while i haven't had an glitches, for some reason i have had multiple technical issues despite building a computer in 2020. this game is exceedingly poorly optimized for lowermid tier computers. which is odd given reasonable file size. despite having ray tracing on my graphics card and running every other game on max settings, my computer can't run ray tracing on cyberpunk and gets massive frame drops when doing the racing missions, even with dlss turned on. the graphics and level of details are very pretty when they work, but you'll need like a 24k computer to run them which makes them more of a snub at everyone than a feature. world absolutely stunning. there's so many different levels to the world here, there's steam and smoke. cops arresting people, random sidemissions galore. my only issue is that they need a way to help organize all of the content. the cop programming makes 0 sense. they just spawn whenever you do a crime. one time i killed a ripper doc who was murdering people in their own hideout to chop them up for parts. the police spawned inside the hideout and started shooting at me. story haven't completed yet, but rather stereotypical thus far for cyberpunk, still really enjoying it. i like seeing all of the layers the different characters have, my only issue is that thus far i'm not seeing much character progression, but that's a very common issue in video games. gameplay cars  on keyboard and mouse. gunplay and melee are both fine. the tutorials practically might as well not have bothered they're so bad looking at you hacking minigame tutorial. the tutorial for leveling up doesn't even exist, and it really should. one of my biggest beefs is also that you can't just go to a menu you need, then back out. you have to open the main menu, to open the sub menu, then back out of each one at a time rather than just having a getbacktotheaction button. also, there's little to no rpg element to it like they had in the witcher. i.e., you don't have much if any character agency. your options are usually be a jackass, be a rude jackass, be a smartass and a jackass, and be a loveable jackass and a pushover. ambiance really part of the world, but it's so freaking good i'm making it it's own quality. the attention to detail, and look really make you feel like you're there. audiomusic audio design is far too subtle for things like footsteps etc. i had to crank most volume down to half to even hear them. music is fine, but nothing special. breakdown technical 610 world 910 story 910 gameplay 710 ambiance 1110 audiomusic 810 overall me 910 overall 810"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,looter shooter with a good story. everything about the hype was all jibber jabber.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"at first i was playing it on ps4 base and it was horrible before the update, but it gave an improved lightweight, then i migrated to ps5 that runs the ps4 pro version and the game is very beautiful and running well. i'm really enjoying it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i will start with what they did right here the story is great, truly cd projekt red material, the map looks really like a large and vertical city, you can look up and see those holographic billboards and megastructures and yes it looks fantastic, since i'm reviewing the pc copy, performance looks allright, not great not terrible medium settings, 1440p, and 30fps on a 1070. now before i start with what happened wrong with cyberpunk 2077 yeah it's full of bugs, bethesda level of full of bugs but this happens, it is annoying, but this can solved, a few months and a couple patches and it's good as new. so here's the part that no simple bugfix will do and need serious overhauls what i can not forgive about an aaa open world title in 2020, is bad ai, and cyberpunk 2077 one is so bad it feels completely nonexistent, people won't react to anything you do, and when they do they only crouch scared, not even trying to run, traffic is even more painful to watch the cars only drive on rails in a painfully obvious way, you stop a car in the middle of the road, and npcs start a line blocked by your car, no honks, no one trying to turn around, if you blow up something people will just exit their cars and crouch instead of, you know, running away using the car they are already inside. this lack of driving extends to the police, there's no police car chases, and cop npcs will instead just spawn behind you, even gta san andreas was way better than this. also, for a rpg full of cybernetics and body modifications, the lack of character customization after creation is ironic, to say the least, you can't even change the haircut, and witcher 3 a game from the same studio, on same engine had realistic growing beard and hair as well as barber shops. but thanks for letting customize genitalia and then never using it in game besides a glitch where it pops out of your pants i guess. in summary, good story and campaign, nice aesthetic, bugs will get fixed soon, and the open world is so broken it will need a no man's sky level of rework to be good"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i would love to enjoy the game. and there are minutes where i do. until the quest dialogue is broken, i glitch and get stuck in walls, randomly die because i hit an edge of a map item. the game is super sadly absolutely broken and i do not understand how this absolute bloody mess has been released. you should be sued for cheating customers into buying the game at this stage. its also an injustice towards your line staff who clearly where on the best way to create a masterpiece . now you ruined your reputation because you were bullied by your shareholders to release an unfinished mess."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"fanatism and hate aside, this game deserves a 7,5 in the most objective point of view and here is why i have divided this review in 4 main subjects whose mark is given by the mathematical mean of their subsections atmosphere 8.5 also divided in  scenography 9  beautiful city, colorful and enormous, i think nobody can argue this.  coherenceimmersion 8  everything fits together within its context except few minor details, only big bad thing ai, these npcs can get you out of the game completly but we will talk about it later on the gameplay section. story 6.5 also divided in main quests also include big side quests that may affect main story line like judy's arc or panam's 7.5  very good narrative and decent stories, depends on your taste this plot will catch your attention or not. side quests 5.5  pretty dissapointing coming from cdpr, we expected really elaborated missions with different subplots that complement the main story just like the witcher 3 did, . unfortunately for us this is not the case, repetitve and plane side quests with no transcendence whatsoever. go here and kill this evil guy or go here and install this   characters 6.5  obviating the overhype for keanu reeves, just a few characters are worth it, you can feel some of them have their own goals and personalities but they dont really meet the expectations, the witcher 3 did a better job in these terms. culturalartiticgrahical quality 9 also divided in art 9.5  practically perfect in this subject, you can tell they put a great effort on making buch of art like ads, drawings, scultures, objects, cars,  which gives an unique personality to the game, creating its own personal culture. graphics 8.5  very good quality, maybe rdr2 graphics are slightly better but there's not much to say except some minor graphical glitches. and last but not least gameplay 6 also divided in combat 7  very usual type of combat, nothing especially original, you can abuse stealth like every other game of its kind, but besides from that its pretty much normal, too simple abilities they are just porcentages. enough variety of weapons and clothes.  ai 5  just meets the minimum requierments to be playable, terrible police system, braindead enemies and civilians, you would expect that from ea on his next assasins creed game, but not this one.  options 6  with options i mean the posibilities of dialogs the game gives you and how they influence your story line. in this case, these options are pretty pointless, they wont be relevant almost every time, just on final and important missions they can decide the outcome but its kinda upsetting that your decisions wont matter and the outcome will always be the same, for example, you can choose killing this guy or not but it doesnt matter in the end, or you can choose do a quest in a sneaky way or with a shutgun oblitarating the enemis it wont matter, the outcome will be the same. we need to consider that this is a rol game. in conclusion, 7.5. without the bugs and glitches, a better ai, and with more terciary content like the posibilitie to custom your cars, more implants to energize the gameplay,more idle  this game could go up to 8.5 maybe. but the structural problems like the bad side quests or characters will always be there. hope this helped you"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"ok, full disclosure i preordered this game the day it became available cause i'm a cdpr fanboy and love the cyberpunk aesthetic. so i'm probably a bit biased in my opinion. that said... the good   i'll say it up front  i'm in love with this game. the sheer scale of night city, with all its verticality and a plethora of activities, is truly impressive. maybe it's just because of the type of player i am, but i feel like i could probably play this game for a whole year without ever making any more progress with the main storyline and not get bored  there's just too much else to do. side missions, crimes, gigs, oh my! before i started playing this game i thought i was gonna put in enough time to 100 it but.. that just seems impossible now that i've seen it all plus who knows how much i've missed out on with my choice already.  distractions aside, i'm also enjoying what i've seen of the actual main story so far... i find the characters interesting, and i genuinely want to know what's gonna happen next  though i realize a lot of people don't find it as engaging as i do . got a shock at the end of act 1 that i definitely wasn't expecting based on prerelease videos which got me even more invested in where the story leads. i've heard the main storyline is a bit shorter than expected, but with so much else to do that doesn't really bother me.  combat is fun, if you want it to be. hacking enemies up with a lighting fast katana is satisfying af still haven't given the mantis blades a try yet, though... soon enough. gunplay took a bit of getting used to for me, but now that i've figured out the weapon types and effects i've really grown to like the different approaches you can take to firefights. tech weapons combined with the ping quickhack wallhack, more like basically gives you the ability to shoot through wall at least with the widowmaker  great for clearing out enemies literally without them ever knowing what hit them. the bad   there are definitely a few bugs remaining that i'm optimistic will be ironed out with more time and future updates. really would've liked to see a higher level of polish with the launch version but to be honest after 2 delays i had already lowered my expectations significantly so honestly i'm just happy to be playing it wow, that's not what you want to be saying about a game but... it's the truth lol. i had one mild graphical glitch when i first started playing where trees and bushes would always display on my screen even when they should be hidden from view by other objects like...buildings, but then i updated my graphics driver and that issue was gone  shoutout to nvidia for that one. other than that... so far my experience has been relatively glitch free. some of my friends reported weird things like genitals showing outside of clothes, characters randomly being naked in some scenes, etc... but i haven't noticed anything like that so far in my time with the game. i also haven't experienced any of the odd police spawns that others have mentioned, so i'll knock on wood and hope that my good fortune continues. a few small movement glitches like i'll be walking then suddenly teleport 10 feet ahead but nothing that i'm sure won't be resolved with a little more polish.  driving...takes a bit of getting used to. everything feels like a boat until you really get the hang of tapping s andor the space bar lol. that said, the vehicles themselves look pretty fantastic, i only wish there was more customization available. or even a garage to repair the damage when i inevitably crash going 180mph. also, the other cars  at driving. that's normally my excuse, but this time i swear it's true.  character customization is rather limited at the moment. would like to see an option added in the future to tweak your character's appearance after the initial character selection screen. constantly hearing about people in the game replacing parts and changing appearances, so would make sense if we were able to do that too...  the frame rate. oof. i get that i'm not running a top of the line pc anymore, so it'd probably help to shill out for some upgrades.. but right now i'm happy if i get 3540fps regularly. sometimes in less crowded areas or inside of buildings it'll spike up to 6070 for a bit and it looks so fluid and pretty i almost shed a tear.  i want the ability to zoom out my mini map. like give me a minimap scale slider or something. my tiny ass minimap has lead to missing turns more often than not though as a result i've gotten a lot of practice doing the akira bike slide which makes me feel badass. overall i already love it, but it certainly won't live up to the hype for everyone right now. i can't wait to see what it's like once cdpr have ironed out all the kinks  and i look forward to updating my review to a 10 when they do."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"reviewing this out of the perspective of playing on the ps5. i've found this game really enjoyable. the story is great, the gunplay feels great and the driving is good. something to keep in mind is that gunplay and driving gets vastly better once you level up your skills or find better vehicles. world beautiful with tons of things to do, i keep getting lost in just running around doing encounters and minor side quests. what's missing to me is minor rp features that should be standard in open world games by this point, like sitting down to eat or drink with a corresponding animation for the action. customization i love the way clothing stacks, i feel like i'm in control of the way i look but it's missing tools to customize the appearance of clothes and guns which doesnt make sense to me when there's multiple of the same gun in the game all with different skins etc. i like to stick with a good gun when i find it, and sometimes the best gun isnt the one with the coolest skin. you can also not change appearance nor haircut which is quite mind boggling. ai the ai is just horrible and definitely not what i expected from a aaa game in the 2020s. the wanted system is completely broken. npcs all do the exact same animation at the same time. cover in fear. i expected a lot more. fortunately this doesn't take away too much from the core gameplay for the way i'm playing the game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"originally had it on series x, didn't care for the performance so got it on pc. the more i play it the more i come away feeling that it's a mediocre game at best. putting aside the bugs and the underhanded hiding of the console versions and just reviewing the game's content, i still give the writing and narrative a 910, easily. and the music is easily a 8 or 9 as well. beyond that though? the open world design feels dated and is lacking a lot of things that its contemporaries in the same genre have. something as simple as a barber shopappearance changing area for example. how is it that i'm playing a game about transhumanism where looks and attitude are everything, yet i can't change my v's appearance at all after initial character creation? the most i can do is change clothes but even that's a joke because clothes are stat sticks, so we all end up looking like hobos wearing a hodgepodge of crap. there are almost no side distractions not to be confused with side missions as there are in other open world games some games are guilty of cramming too many distractions in but they're optional things you can safely avoid, but in cyberpunk there's almost none. they tease you with braindance parlors but you can't go watch a braindance on your own time. bars exist, but you can't do much with them. there are arcade and  machines all over, but they're just noninteractive textures. the way cdpr talked about the dense cityscape, i was somewhat expecting a good mix between something like gta and yakuza, with a lot of side distractions that you could waste your time on. maybe i expected too much in that regard but it doesn't even have as many distractions as the last three ac games or even gta games from three generations ago. the rpg elements are equally as mediocre. i've already mentioned the clothingasstatsticks, which is annoying enough seriously, clothing items should be cosmetic and have mod slots with mods that work with your cyberware for stats, what an amazing concept, amirite?? but the stats themselves are just awful. progressing armor or damage by tenths of percentages? ugh. lifepaths have no meaning beyond some inconsequential dialog choices and the intro sequence. dialog is a linear affair, always ending up having you say what the game wants you to, and there's no real way to shape your v the way you want. in the same place in the game, my corpo fem v and my nomad male v are functionally identical both smart ass mercs who say what they want regardless of my input and don't act any different based on their history in night city. both crafting and the game economy are fundamentally broken, in its present state you can find myriad videos online showing you how to exploit the brokenness for millions of eddies in mere minutes. the menu and inventory system is just god awful. i'm having genuine flashbacks to launch mass effect 1 back on x360 where i was spending more time dismantling the same gear into omnigel and fiddling with mod slots more than i was playing segments of the game. same thing here. the menu and inventory system is such a cluttered affair that you spend more time clicking through submenus and looking at gear stats and character points than you do playing. this ties into the rpg elements  it feels like it could have been better designed and somewhat streamlined a bit. it doesn't need to gut the elements as much as mass effect did from me1 to me2 but it definitely needs some focus and tightening up. driving and shooting are passable. melee feels like an afterthought though and is a pain in the ass to pull off even when properly built for it. or maybe i'm just bad. but that's a minor complaint compared to the rest. all in all, the game feels like a 710, tops, without the bugs. solid writing, solid music and sound effects, but the rest of the game is just middle of the pack in the genre. certainly not the next generation of open world games as their launch trailer touted."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"lets see as an open world game it's a complete disaster. a superfical frosting world where the npc's have barely any ai to speak off. shenmue a game released in 1999 has a more convincing open world experience than this dull garbage. the characters and plot are truly call of duty tier, how cdpr went from the witcher 3's engaging story full of rich characters to this generic trash just boggles my mind. as for the gameplay, driving is serviceable but boring. the gunplay is painful and grindy, and as for the close quarter combat don't make me laugh a student at university could do a better job. there is literally nothing in this game that warrants anything close to a 1010 be it gameplay, narrative or depth. many of these shortcomings were completely forgiveable in the witcher 3 because it had a convincing story with an amazing soundtrack, a world that felt tangible and rich, you cared for geralt and ciri. i care for no one in this  game, rockstar made cdpr look like amateurs and to top it all of their are so many glitches you released a boring game and it wasn't even finished. wow."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game has been hyped to hell and back. i personally did not follow any of the coverage leading up the game, as i just don't care much for that sort of thing anymore,i just want to experience it on my own. i don't care that cdpr is making it, as we have seen in many cases, where devs can fall from grace over night. bioware put out anthem, bethesda put out fallout 76 etc. etc. i have now completed most side missions, and the main campaign which gave me about 30 hours. so here are my thoughts, and if you think i'm going to give cdpr a free pass, think again. this game should have been delayed by a year or so. cdpr kept boasting about the game would not be released until it was polished and ready. people keep saying its been in development for 8 years, which is simply not true, development did not start until witcher 3 was completed. no doubt is this game ambitious, and no doubt is the game itself actually worth playing, its just not worth playing right now. wait a year, because this is clearly not ready. i dont like the release it now, fix it later mentality, that seems to keep getting more common by the day, and cdpr is not getting a free pass, because that is clearly the route they went with here. if ea, ubisoft or whoever put this out, they would be laughed out of town. heres the tldr the good  night city is an amazing space, that thank god gets rid of the ubisoft approach of bigger is better. it does not focus on square miles and a huge map. but instead a very dense world with amazing design that is so well connected. its  insane amount of detail, but most of it is superficial, and just more there for show.  very good side missions, that are not boring ubisoft busywork that we have become used to.  the graphics can sometimes look truly amazing  story can be really good, with some really good characters. the bad  the games optimization is beyond awful. it really has to be seen to be believed. i have really good hardware and could not get a steady 60 fps without turning alot of stuff down to high and medium.  the graphics can sometimes look really awful. with flat lightning, and sometimes the lightning is just totally over exposed, glaring you with lens flares and bloom.  there are just far too many characters. many of which just propel you from one place to the next, and only appear for 5 minutes.  some side missions are kind of phoned in. one mission had me save a guys brother, which was like 100 meters away, i save him and thats just it?  most choices are superficial, and dont impact much of the game in any meaningful way.  the game is sooo buggy! i cant remember playing something this buggy. t poses, graphics going fubar, stuck in place, quests i could not progress in forcing me to reload or restart the game, crashes, clipping, missing audio, dilaogue overlapping each other, objects spawning upside down, ai i could go on and on. the final mission for me was ruined by so many bugs, and i kid you not, i had to reload 10 times. a very crucial object kept flipping upside down, enemies spawned in the air, animations got bugged out.  terrible ai, really ruins a lot the cool encounters and combat  the economy tuning is so bad. things are far too expensive and you earn so little. by the end i could barely afford a lot the cars, implants etc.  systems like crafting, and quick hacking is just kind of pointless. you can get items that are better than what you can craft, very quickly, and hacking is just too cumbersome and slow. it was much quicker and more fun to just shoot. whats the point of giving me an option to kill or nonlethal takedowns when there's no consequence to doing either? deus ex at least gave you more xp, or had certain moments play out different depending on what you did.  there's little to no reaction in anything in the city. you can steal stuff from npcs right in front of their face, you can run over everybody because the police is just pointless. it literally takes 15 seconds of driving away from them until they give up.  the game never bothers to make you think, or ask interesting things like deus ex does. not that it should drown in ethics, philosophy or politics. but with this kind of source material, there are so many issues to tackle, but this games just never does anything with it.  romance options are kind of disappointing as they are gender locked. granted i got a really good romance,  playing on a controller is a really bad experience. no matter how i tuned it, it just felt sluggish and really hard to aim.  weapon mods are totally pointless, for example giving you 0.5  better ads time, i mean why even bother.  clothing and stats are hard locked. sorry if you want to look cool, if you want the best stats you will look like a homeless hobo. why is there no transmog system?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,im sure year 2077 will never like this this game have no fun and enterrainment im really regretful for buying this awful disappointig game
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have never reviewed a game because i felt a fair analysis was given by others and my input would add to the masses. this time, i see an overwhelming amount of positivity for this game which i can only assume is because people are mad they waited 8 years and already wasted the money on it. anyone who cares about games knew that this game consists of recycled garbage from other game franchises which has been done much better by said companies. cyberpunk feels like a mishmash of games like fallout, far cry, and gta. they tried to do so much well that it all turned out mediocre and unenjoyable. and rpg elements, are almost nonexistent. this game is nothing like what was advertised. i expected a huge city we could explore and manipulate in any way we wanted. interactable ai, buildings we could enter at our leisure, activities, events. instead, we get none of that, not even much character customization within the game. every life path is essentially the same thing with slight differences. dialogue choices do not affect v's personality, tone, or the outcome of the conversation. the world is extremely boring, buggy, and hard to play in. the ai is scripted and reacts to nothing the player does. cops might as well not even be in the game. every rpg system is so barebones and does not give you a sense of progression at all apart from small stat increases. but the most disappointing part of it all is that the trust has been broken. cdpr, a company that appeared to be for gamers withheld console copies of this game for review and basically scammed every base console player who bought this game. had it been any other company the backlash would be immense. this is why i have given the game a 0 it is the only score that i feel is fitting, since they had 8 years to make a quality product, but instead came out with a generic, mediocre, and uninspired rpg that should've come out 8 years ago. this behavior is unforgivable and unforgettable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,omg! ppl put 0 but there almost no bug in the stadia version and super 4k graphic best game this year! worth the 80  can!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"right, first of all they rushed the release due to an incredibly high demand, which they shouldn't have, some of the bugs in the game are ridiculous and very frequent. i've played just over 14 hours doing some side missions, at least 23 hours and ive completed the main story already. for a game of this magnitude the main story should be alot longer, it's probably shorter than gta v. the driving is quite bad but its not a driving game so it can be forgiven, at the start the shooting felt horrible but i got used to it after a while then it felt decent. i was just expecting so much more, i expected the story to be a skyrim level story, one that seems to take a long time to finish. you have to accumulate alot of ingame wealth to purchase upgrades which seems impossible, my character was honestly quite weak at the end game, i still had at least 8 cybertech categories to buy. if the game was longer, it would be incredible, and when they fix the bugs of course."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,great game! i was wating for it and it wasn't in vain! i just love how cdpr make quests!

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"it's a shame all the hype they have given, being a compromising company with the witcher that has screwed up so much. not even the game is finished, every time you spend more time playing it literally makes me want to stop playing, the npcs is the worst seen since the ps2 in terms of intelligence, unfinished animations, disgusting driving, even sensitivity makes me nervous in certain aspects, not even well managed to pick things up off the ground. i really don't want to look like a hater, i love this company but it has screwed up too much. or that they finish this game as they should or that they at least dedicate themselves to making games that they are used to ... or maybe after this i prefer that they do not even try to make the witcher 4 it is not going to destroy the saga."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the game is just outdated and isn't the next generation experience i came to expect. open world games have evolved. it doesn't have the immersion that you would expect, the world doesn't feel alive at all, it is quite empty considering its scope i know on console there wouldn't be as many people as we see on pc but still the npc a.i. is really poor and unrealistic. people just run away from any drama and then duck around the corner doing nothing, the police don't make any sense. npc's do not feel alive, they don't seem to do much at all, the rpg elements feel like action game elements. no one reacts or responds, it just feels so souless. as i have mentioned, open world games have evolved, this sadly hasn't. i haven't even experienced as many bugs as many other users on the as i am using ps4 pro but still there are lots, however that isn't what ruins the game, the world ruins the game. fallout, skyrim...pretty much all bethesda games have created more immersive worlds. gameplay is average"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,very beautiful nights. good soundtracks. charismatic characters. interesting upgrade system.  car physics. interface. a lot of bugs. wanted system. crafting. optimization. this game is not as good as we all waited.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"game is okay. it is not an rpg, it is not a nextgen game apart from the graphics for which you need pretty decent pc. otherwise they look mediocre. however the state it was released in should be unacceptable to people. i personally was able to play on my hardware. mostly without problems, but from what i see it was a mess for consoles. i was a cdpr fan, though i won't give them a pass. if you just want to experience an action story that goes for 1520 hours in a quite beautiful but shallow cyberpunk world, that also has some very good sidemissions, the game might be for you. if you have the hardware that is. do not expect any deep, relevant character, crafting or rpg system. gunplay is fine. overall a let down for me."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,pc yes there are bugs but story and graphicks is great. i'm having allot of fun with this game. after fev patches it will be perfect

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the only thing great about this game is its graphics. which is impossible to see with average pcs. i would be ok to play this game with low settings, stable 30 fps with my 1060 gtx... when it comes to customizations you cant. you would expect to customize your guns , cars and even your body in the game but its too much to ask for a game which lets you customize your  in character screen. and you would expect some naughty scenes since you could customize your thing. but again no. there are only 2 hookers in this game. and no bds you can watch which were mentioned in the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,great game a few technical glitches at launch but these will be fixed by patches. story is great gameplay is fun and the different skill trees offers a variety of options for play styles. the game has high replayability and i can't wait to start my second playthrough once i finish my current one.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"it's just a perfect game regarding the story but the bugs need fixing, other than that, for me it's a masterpiece."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,this is bare level mediocrity at best. the graphics are average and the gameplay is even worse. this is a complete bait and switch game. this is this years no mans sky that feels like it was developed by ea. and forget all the fake positive reviews. just read how blunt and how they read compared to other reviews.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the only thing truly nextgen about cyberpunk 2077 are the visuals. the city looks absolutely incredible. cyberpunk is the next crysis in that it will be the ultimate litmus test for gaming pc builds. unfortunately, the game isn't very fun. the combat is floaty and lacks the crispiness demonstrated by modern lootshooters like destiny and borderlands. driving is ok. hacking and stealth mechanics are incredibly boring and uninspired. the npc ai is so ridiculously terrible that it completely breaks immersion w night city. most npcs are just statues, molded in place going through routine motions."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,good game with interesting characters and good gameplay. while many people expected new gta i was expecting witcher but in cyberpunk
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"including bugs, 410 i can honestly do a stand up comedy skit regarding the bugs. ill just mention that this is far more common, far more catastrophic, and far more hilarious than skyrim bugs for its first release. i can honestly write an entire 60 minute stand up comedy skit on this, but ill just share my personal favorite...i kept spontaneously lighting on fire. i would die and have to reload my games, this has happened twice now. not including bugs 610 but why only a 6? the gunplay feels old and bullet spongy, its basically a tuned down borderlands. to kill enemies without the right upgrades, you literally have to shoot their heads like 10 times and throw 3 grenades at them. luckily the ai is so bad its very easy to do.  some large areas of the map are crazy barren. theres no cars, no people, despite their being considerable infrastructure. clearly just sets for missions to be ran on. the missions are scripted very heavily. the dialogue options mostly go 1 direction despite you wanting to try another. there are instances where your hp loss is a fixed value, and the enemies very obviously have the same outcome regardless of how much you shoot them. theres not much to do in the city aside from shoot angry dudes. theres basically only spots with enemies that are hanging around, no other forms of interaction. no flying vehicles, and the ground based vehicles you have drive like  the cars dont feel like they have any future tech associated with them, and the motorcycle physics are a joke. if you drive a big truck, the camera sits behind it and you cant see. you cant even shoot out tires on cars. hijacking requires you to have a certain skill level to have the strength to take it from someone even if theyre dead and the window is shot open. there has yet to be a single substantial npc or interaction i have found outside of the games missionsstory arc. where the hell is all the substance in this world beyond the cyberpunk looks? hot dog vendors literally just tell you the  you want? and then proceed to run out of generic dialogue options. people in the club are just like, uhhh, can i help you? police do not have the ai to drive after you, they spawn after you."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'm playing this game on pc. there are many issues with the game. some are technical, some are basic mechanics of the game itself. i'll start with the game itself. as anyone that has followed the game knows there are many aspects to a character in game. you can build a fighter or net runner type character. focus on direct assault or sneaking. my problem is that each of these is quite shallow. for example, the breaching and net running has no variation. it's the same mini game over and over. it doesn't get more complicated or even mix it up. the assault falls short because the animations for melee fighting are not fit for current generation fights. when you have no combos, no real blocking in real time like was done in other games such as red dead redemption, then the fight just becomes a late 90's keyboard smasher.  it's out of place. the first person view is ok, but the problem with that is it does nothing unique with that viewpoint to make it worth playing in that mode. the controls and sensitivity are of the poorest quality, when nearly every game has standardized controller inputs there is no need to build one from scratch and do a bad job at it. the interface is clunky and redundant, taking way more clicks to get something done than is needed when you have to grind things out like selling many items or crafting. as for the bugs, many are game breaking. the visual quality overall even on pc is poor. i feel like i'm running skyrim that's how bad the game looks on pc. now for the real issue the management of this game from cdpr.  this game was marketed as a cutting edge experience and was sold as such. this is deceptive and is what i'm calling a betanswitch. it's at least 2 years from being ready. an example is breath of the wild. amazing, and played great. sure there were patches, but they were so minor i never even noticed any changes because the game was so polished and ready for release. this game is the exact opposite. the forums on cyberpunk are also banning anyone that does not have glowing happy joy joy feelings about the state of the game. if you reply to someone with your thoughts and the mods consider it to be of an opposite opinion, they will ban you and forbid you from participating in the forums. it's insane, authoritarian and has tarnished the good will and respect i've had for cdpr over the years. do yourself a favor, don't buy this game until 2021 or 2022. perhaps by then it will be ready for a decent player experience."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"incredible world, made me fall in love with gaming again. yes there are bugs, but didn't encounter anything blocking and they will be fixed. playing on xbox series x"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,although i do get the gripes with functionality and playability on the previous gen consoles and perhaps pcs that barely meet the minimum requirements but this is one of the greatest games ive ever played. it is such an achievement in almost every category. the graphics are absolutely stunning. the main and side storylines are extremely immersive and as rich as a good book or film.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"embarrassing world design is both childish and low quality. stories are shallow and short. the world is lifeless and directionless. backstories are a 20 minute mission that has zero impact on the game. cops will spawn in a circle around you if you commit a crime and npcs respond to conversation with a silent ...! technically there is zero art direction and what seems to be the same 12 assets reused infinitely. it looks awful even at 4k on a 3090, textures and models are best described as 2008 quality. in 30 years of gaming i've never been so embarrassed for a company."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i was one of the lucky ones that didn't have many bug issues and yet, i still found this game very disappointing. the good stuff  the atmosphere and the open world that they aesthetically created is fantastic. the story is good, gunplay is decent and there are some cool cyberwear upgrades to get. the bad stuff  1. the open world is absolutely dead. compare this to red dead 2 and it's lacking way behind. other than the story and side missions, there is nothing to do! why create an open world when it's this boring? may as well have made it more linear and probably could have released the game a couple of years earlier. 2. the citizen ai is terrible. the ai's driving is worse than gta vice city. all the ai does is use the pathfinding routes and if you block traffic they stop still. don't even beep their horns and tell you to get the hell out of the way. if you have a gunfight with a gang or you want to go on a rampage the citizen ai just sit down with their hands on their heads and scream a little  few if any of them run away and why the hell don't any of them have guns to fire back? again, red dead 2 is way, way, better in this area. 3. serious question, does cdpr know what a rpg is? this game should be classed as an open world, looter shooter story. after you have initially created your character, there are virtually zero customisable options. that goes for your character's personality and attire. there's no consequences to your character's actions, loot whoever you like, kill whoever you like you'll get a 30second police chase  no bounty, no consequences. makes the world boring and unimmersive. there are no consequences for not going to sleep, eating, you can't get a haircut  red dead has more rpg elements and rockstar didn't even market it as an rpg game. 4. once you've completed the story, end credits roll and you can't go back into night city to roam about to see what the world is like after the story has finished. good job there's nothing to do in the world anyway. 5. when i preordered this back in march 2020 i thought this game would take over my life and i would spend 100's of hours playing this just to experience the open world of night city, a dystopic future set in 2077. i've played 50 hours and completed all the missions. i'm now done with the game and i probably won't pick it up again for at least another year. i would say i hope they sort out the issues that i have mentioned above but i seriously doubt they will, they've had 8 years to create this lol. i've had some fun with it but this is not anyway near a 50 game. i keep on comparing to red dead 2 to demonstrate how average this game is compared to that. honestly, i think the openworld mechanics and citizen ai is better in mafia 1 than on this game. total let down. it's a shame that cdpr don't just pass this game to rockstar right now so the game can live up to it's my advice to anyone  do not buy this game at full price wait for a good sale price. 2025 is a good value for this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"a great disappointment, great atmosphere, great story, great music, but what can i say? outside the quests the world is dead. shoot a bullet in the air, turn 360 degrees and all npc's and vehicles disappear. npc's are boring and have 0 interactions. all the buildings are closedoff, police spawns out of fov the second you commit a crime. performance is awful, npc's and vehicles have some of the worst and boring ai i've come to witness in any game. this game feels unfinished. it's like they did the mainstory and big sidequest and then said ah,  it, we did the story, lets make the rest just work. and the sad part, it doesn't work, and all the immersion, lightning, music, sounds, atmospheres are completely ruined by the amount of bugs and bad execution of programming that exists. it's so sad, i feel sorry for the people who did great work for this game, only to get their work ruined by some lazyass people. the world is a boring, bad illusion and an empty shell to fill out the big city, which it fails horribly at. release free updates and content. don't dare scam people with dlc's."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"sry, the npcs are absolut  really hurt, the city is beautiful, but the npcs are the worst"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"it is the best title i played since maybe ten years, on pc ok. i also can understand tht the console users are so disapointed. or maybe why are so much people are disappointed who wants a sandbox like rockstar games. and of course the ai ist stupid and sure driving with keyboard is funny. but remember is is a role playing game, no shooter, no driving game. it is the first game i never used fast travel tool, or get bored by the story. the first 2 intros were lame ok, but then a story started better than any other story. sure no sandbox tools like fetching animals or her gwent... you have side quests which are better than main quests in other tripple a titles, and always anwhere to look too listen or too shoot. mistakes were maken to bring console at same date. and yes many things are missing they promised but every day do this remember anthem? or pre rendered sequences? but the storyline the sound are ridicilous, we will see that next time maybe in 5 years such a story in 10 years. if you dont think wait for goty edition. and of course the cloting system is funny, an no barbershop or so , well it is no gta sandboxclone. and maybe i have luck but on pc but i find bugs only if i search for them."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the good presentation, artstyle, music, voiceactors. the bad the game. let me explain. on pc the performance is ok but the technical state this game is in in terms of bugs really is breathtaking  but not in a good way. it is crashing constantly, animation hiccups and tposes everywhere, clipping issues, quests which cannot be closed before reload, npcs and cars spawningdespawning in front of your eyes and the absolute horrible pathing, etc. the more you play the worse it's getting. if these problems are solved and a ton of quality of life improvements are in place seriously, there is no dedicated dodge or walk key and specific keybinds cannot be remapped from the menu at all this is a solid 710 for me  hell, if everything is working and i'm cruising down the road with my motorcycle with cranked up pacific dreams radio it feels ! like a 1010 at times. however this is not thanks to the core gameplay but the great art direction, the sights of the openworld and the promise and wonder the world is radiating affecting my judgement. i'm hopeful for what the game can be in 2 to 3 years from now with the bugs all fixed, the dlc content released and everything running properly, but i cannot recommend you to play it today. if you can wait, wait. i really wish i could have. unfortunately the technical inadequacies are not the biggest problem the game is facing  it is the promise which the players have been given the game to be and therefore the game itself. i've loved this game the first almost bugfree few hours on my first playthrough for all that was supposed to be awaiting me in this world. but make no mistake, cyberpunk 2077 is no rpg. cdpr didn't remove this from their pr material by chance. the developers not just the marketing team or management promised an immersive openworld with deep customization in terms of looks as well as character development in a gameplay and story sense. they have promised a fullyfledged rpg. a level system and a few skill trees with no real impact on how you play the game, perks just changing percentages of damage, crit, movement and reload speeds and a few branching quests are not that. to say this is a rpg, let alone a fullyfledged one, is a flat out lie. with cops spawning behind your back, no driving ai or any ai at this point for npcs, no customizable body shape the character creator is basic af or shops for getting haircuts andor tattoos, no eating animations  ripperdoc animations  cyberspace  braindance outside of story scenes, lifepaths or choices not affecting v's character at all, bad crafting and item economy, balancing issues, boring unimaginative bossfights ... i could go on. for hours. the notion to get the game released this year, whatever it takes, is only part of why this game is in the state it is in. one could get teary eyed over watching the 2018 trailer promising so much. a few years from now with more content and patches this could be a good game. but there is something even all the bugfixes in the world cannot patch away that we were lied to and there are decadeold games out there doing better yes, i'm looking at you rockstar. this is an overpromised mess, the likes of which i've only experienced thrice in the last decade of video games. with no man's sky, fallout 76 and anthem. make of that what you will."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the game has some issues with bugs but i'm seeing less and less of those as i continue to play and the game continues to be updated. the driving is just fine, i think for all the weight the funds have the vehicles might still be leaving that. i'm also a little sad that there aren't post character creation cosmetic changes available and very little cosmetic cyberware upgrades available. on the other hand the story and characters are phenomenal. you quickly get attached to people and pulled into their lives. the game beautiful as well, despite the getting sorry future that it exists in i'm still looking around in awe at everything. i'm excited for what the future holds and i'm confident that issues will be addressed going forward."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have never felt so scammed playing a video game, ever. this is absolutely disgusting. only thing that makes me feel little better is that every next game they release will be ignored and just hated with all the passion possible. worst developers ever. they take 8 years to come up with promises, take all the preorders and then release most mediocre buggy game that feels like it has been in development max 2 years. pathetic."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"game isn't finished. crashes all the time, ai characters get caught on level geometry and it generally feels unready. gunplay is good though and there seems to be plenty of loot. i am uninstalling until next year when it gets fixed up."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"just an average game in general, but extremely buggy as well. i was expecting to be able to do some roleplaying as well as be able to make a name for myself. unfortunately that's all compressed into a 30 second cutscene at the beginning of the game, was a real  punch. i really enjoyed gta v for just driving around in the world, but night city is dead, the npcs are lifeless, the police just teleport around, and there's nothing to do anyways. it's basically just an interactable loading screen for the next story mission."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"stadia version gotta say the game is amazing storywise, the world is beautifully crafted and the immersion factors in. a lot of people expected the game to be a gta type, but its an rpg and most of the game i was just immersed in the conversations, and getting to know the characters, their stories rather than nonstop shooting everyone up. it is a buggy game, and sometimes it's straightup annoying, i can't attest to the ps4, xbox one versions as i played on stadia, but the glitches are apparent  driving doesn't feel fullfilling with the starting car, although i haven't tried the more expensive cars which could be more rewarding. bugs like picking up items of the ground doesn't always work, in the main mission a car was flipped a few times, but it works when you reload it. stealth mechanics feel basic, shooting feels rewarding when you hit it with the controller, and melee combat is clunky but functional and actually my preferred way of playing on the controller. the movement mechanics feel clunky, and there isn't as much flow as if you played a cs go game but its understandable. the game really focuses on rpg elements, visuals and music. as with the bugs, i am sure that cd project red will iron them out completely in 34 months time, and maybe rebuild some game mechanics. the main story is amazing, and the characters will stay in your mind for a long while after you finish the game"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"sure  it took me 3 days to get my key binds and the game working to a playable state. and even after that, i had to deal with sound  video issues. so why am i giving it an 8? because the next 3 days i was glued to my computeraddicted. this game has a great story, with excellent side missions to keep you busy. is it the most realistic open world ever? definitely not. the fact that npcs are halfbaked, and cops spawn right in front of you as opposed to appearing organically makes this open world halfbaked as well, if not acceptable. but once you get past all that, you figure out that the open world is still an open world. there's a huge canvas you can design onrooftops, back alleys, and multiple ways to enter buildings  areas. it's not exactly deus ex, but you do get those sorts of vibes in certain missionslocations, where you have multiple ways you can approach. if i had to put my finger on it, cp2077 takes a small piece of games like deus ex, gta,  rdr2, and smashes them together. what you get isn't a masterpiecebut it's a hell of a lot of fun. there's so much here, that it's surprising how many low scores there are. after playing 25 hours, it's hard for me to relate. and it's hard for me to believe that these folks have actually played the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"first of all, people criticize cb2077 as if fallout 76, gta4 etc. premieres never happened. in addition, gta 5, which premiered in 2013, still has bugs and glitches similar to cyberpunk2077. is that okay? no, but we have a time today when developers make games and accountants decide about the premiere ... the game itself? plot 1010 graphics 1010  you've never seen such a city in the game in your life. rpg elements 710  it's more actionadventure than rpg, but it keeps the level. gameplay 810 is this a good game? very good  does it have bugs and glitches? yes, and they will be fixed. if someone writes that the city in the game is empty, the graphics are crap, and the ai of the npcs is ps2 level, then either they haven't played the game or it's just not a title for them. complaining like that is just a lie. i play with patch 1.04 on 6700k, 2080super, 16gb ram in fhd and i have everything with rtx to the max  the only bugs i have encountered are sometimes a pedestrian phone hanging in the air or a dialogue bug that continues after i leave the character. nothing special. bugs does not interfere the game. as for ps4 and x1  i don't think this game should come out on these consoles and here cdpr made a mistake. thats it. to sum up  cyberpunk 2077 is one of the breakthrough games with an amazinglooking city, cyberpunk atmosphere and a great story. and like any game  it's not for everyone. so if someone complains like a child that the dialogues are too long or the driving is far from being simulated, it means they made a mistake buying cb2077 because it's an rpg with an emphasis on action and not gta5 combined with gran turismo and disco elysium with amazing dialogue options..."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"an excellent game that deserves a warm welcome despite its flaws. of the pros, i can say that i really liked  cool presentation of the narrative, the main and secondary tasks are woven into the gameplay harmoniously and feel smoothly, however, the choice is still yours and you can go to clear the map from activities purposefully  the plot itself pleases, it's nice to dive into history  wellwritten characters  the language of the game does not suffer from modern censorship, it is really fun to read and listen to  i really liked the voice acting in russian, the main and secondary characters are sounded cool and with emotions despite the negative reviews i have encountered, i disagree with them, there are some flaws and inconsistencies in voices with thirdrate characters, but you don't really notice this although i would like even better of course  the graphics are actually nice, you just need to get used to its style, the world is incredibly detailed, the colors are fun, the whole class looks  i will separately note the graphics and animation of the characters, especially in the dialogues, it's just gorgeous!  the dialogue system is fire, you are no longer tied face to face to the interlocutor, you can often walk around the room and examine it while chatting freely or standing and not moving  the choice is yours!  the roleplaying system also pleased you, the choice is often put in front of you, often demanding a quick answer, which heightens the situation and the game becomes even more emotional, the timings are well chosen, you have time to read and make a decision  i liked the talents and buildup, there are many of them, they are different and can interact with each other in the gameplay, they also fit well into it and are not useless  it is pleasant to shoot, i have nothing to add here, cdpr just coped well with its task, not revolutionary, but not a failure, for the first time it's soundly however, not everything is so cloudless and there are disadvantages in some places serious for me personally, here are the ones that i noted  very unpleasant flirting with the console interface .. as a buyer of the disc version of the first witcher, at one time, i am extremely indignant, it is very inconvenient to use some functions on a pc, from creating a character to controlling a car, dear projekt red, please dont it's like a spit in the face of your players  as in the witcher 3, there are serious problems with sorting all the property, it is not thought out properly and is inconvenient for the player, perhaps you, like me, will suffer from constant flipping through the menu back and forth, trying to put things in order and figure out what you need you need what you want to leave, and what to disassemble and where, in general, is the thing that you are looking for  incredibly stupid ai of citizens, they may not even turn their heads when there is a war and explosions on the next street, it is necessary to separate the stupidity of the drivers, they can create a traffic jam even when you parked your car and only 2 wheels were left on the road, these guys just don't able to think that it is possible to bypass an obstacle  poor thoughtfulness of some gameplay elements, something, in my opinion, is at a primitive level even for young children, or they simply did not want to waste time on it, which is a serious misconception in my opinion, as an example a bunch of unnecessary and the same type of food, eateries that could would be more interesting to use than just being, constant changes of scripts in the cyberdeck, although it would be possible to beat their change of gameplay, through presets for this device and bind their change to its characteristics and much much more .. simplicity is visible in many gameplay details and this badly..  hits of opponents in melee stick to you, this diminishes the value of dodges and is unpleasant in gameplay  a very simplified craft, as they say, at least you can assemble a tank in your hands, well, you saw the banter on this score in the scary movie, with the craft of a bulldozer from duct tape,  and sticks on your knee, here it is still easier  minor bugs that are not very noticeable and not particularly annoying, i hope they will be promptly corrected  slightly sagging fps before patch 1.04, after that it got better it is a pity for those people who suffer from lags due to poorquality build of their pc or poorly maintained operating system. on my not the most powerful computer gtx 1080, i7 4gn, 16gb ram, ssd everything works quite nicely  at maximum settings without rtx 5065 fps in the city. in general, i like the game in some places very much. i hope we, gamers, will accept it positively, forgive the reds for some of the jambs and look forward to further development. after all, others in the aaa segment no longer make games with such a soul and without fear of the ubiquitous censorship. thx."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"so i've posted this review on steam, and i'm just going to copy and paste it here to not waste time and my hand lol. i've finished it with 59.8h, to make a quick resume before the full review, the game obviously is not what cdpr promised, the choices doesn't matter much, the ai is dumb, and the game is too short. it's basically a futuristic, first person shooter, the witcher 3. and that's not a bad thing. the ending of this game, is that type of ending where it leaves a void inside you, and you don't know what to do next besides listening to music and reading the lore. it's literally breathtaking, amazing. not just the main quest, but the side ones too, there's a lot of memorable side histories. now for my steam copy and pasted review first of all, i'm not at all in favor of what cdpr did with the launch of the game, specially with the console players. i'm sad that they can't experience what i've just experienced. so, what i've to say about the game... first the gameplay. it's simple but fun, reminds me a lot of deus ex, in a good way... the hacks, the gunplay... there's a lot to improve tho, the looting system is not good, you pick up every single item you see in front of you, and when you can't carry anything more, you start to get rid of what you don't need, and then repeat. the clothing system has the same problem as every other open world rpg with gear levels... you put what it's bet on your character and until it starts to look like a clown, they need a transmog system asap. the history is what kept me engaged in the game for so long. the way they manage the relationship between johnny and v is amazing. i'm not going to tell spoilers here, but this is what will keep you playing too... every single dialog line from johnny made me laugh a little, or feel anger for his personality, sadness for what he's been through, and so on. there are two types of side quests in the game, the gigs that can be easily compared to the witcher contracts in the witcher 3, and the normal side quests. the gigs are just mercenary jobs, the majority are pretty simple and repetitive, but there's some that shine, that requires some thought into it. the side quests are pretty good, what we could expect from cdpr... there are some side quests that are really memorable, with shocking stories, or just some laughs. honestly, for me, i would start a new playthrough right now, but i'm going to wait for some patches or when they start releasing the dlcs. i highly recommend the game... it's been some time since i don't get emotional with the ending ... the last one that did this to me was the witcher 3, and prior to it, life is strange."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,one of the beat games ive had the pleasure of getting my hands on. im currently 112 hours and im still only about half way done with the main story quests. there are tons of side activities and quests to do that youll never run out of anything to do. though the game is damn near flawless on my end as im running the game on a pretty beefy pc id recommend skipping out on this if you have a ps4 or xbox one. the game is just simply not going to run good whatsoever on the older generation consoles. id recommend waiting until you get a hold of a ps5 or xbox series andor a pc.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the game is incredibly good in some things, and discouragingly bad in others. now i'm not talking about bugs and optimization. the ai in the game is just shameful, no jokes, oblivion is better. npcs are purely mannequins, they only take up space, no procedural behavior, no hints of a simulation of life, no reaction to anything. there is no interaction with the world. combat is clumsy, stealth too. the argument that this is not a shooter  not a slasher  not a stealth action does not work  these are the core mechanics of the game, and if they are in the game, they should work well, and not anyhow. considering that 70 of the gameplay we shoot. the map, in the best traditions of the old assassins, is packed with hundreds of thousands of flickering icons and meaningless activities, the inventory is packed with a bunch of rubbish, identical jackets and rifles. even ubisoft eventually found the strength to refuse it, but cyber continues the tradition. on the other hand, the dialogues, the characters, the script of the fullfledged side quests are very good. visually, night city is beautiful. the hacking mechanics, as well as the braindance, are well done. good, solid aaa, but clearly not a masterpiece of the millennium, as it was presented in promotional materials."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game is far away to be a 7. yes cdpr did mistake. the game is buggy and unfortunately the start isn't' great, but what happens when it will be patched. yes if you didn't buy the game, don't buy it now. come back in a month or two where the major patches will be fixed. in 2 months time when you will start playing the came you won't know what the negtive opinions are about. so my score is this. cdpred launch of the game 210. what i mean here is the cd red should be straight forward from the begining and realstic dont rleae the game on all platforms same time and dont release it if its not rea. the game itself for me is 910. p.s please stop comparing the game to gta 4 or 5 at the moment, or watch dogs as you sound like you would juse wake up yesterday. if you really want to compare it to gta or watch dogs then ask yourself. when as gta 3 released? how many years did rochstar had to make this game look like gta 5. and btw are you forgetting how buggy and not playable gta4 and 5 was at the start? than watch dogs one of the most criticized game on the lunch. watch dogs 1 was nearly not playable after several months of patching. and it still not patched correctly until today.. if someone really want to compare those gamse and the time frame how the companies spent on one franchise than look what cd red did with witcher 1 and compare it to witcher 3. so if they patch cyberpunk 2077 what rockstar needed to do with all gtas and ubisoft did with watch dogs then abandoned it that game will be great, and then when they colelct all the experience to release a second cyberpunk it's a start for a long term franchise."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"fps often drops down to 30 thirty when driving a car. on rtx 3090. now i have a question seriously? which hardware were you using when developing and testing, rtx 4090? otherwise, good story. unfortunately still lots of cosmetic and performance glitches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"minor graphical glitches in 3 spots so far 60 hours i love the world, game play, and story."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"a great story hampered by a unimpressive world. night city is a beautiful yet hollow place where npcs feel like they are from a ps2 game and the cops spawn in behind you because they dont have cars. i really want to drive home the fact that the story is fantastic, its the only reason i still enjoy playing the game. to be completely honest though, this game would have been better off as a linear story game because at the end of the day, the open world rpg elements dont enhance the story, rather they detract from it by surrounding it in a pointless shallow shell."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this is one of the best games i have played. a very addictive story and an amazing shooting system. however, there are a lot of bugs in the game that can ruin the gameplay at times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,it's masterful storytelling. loving and memorable characters and overall enjoyable game.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,the lack of transparency by the company is disgusting. game is full of bugs! even worse on consoles... it completely breaks the immersion.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"great game. the best openworld. great gameplay. i think the best story maybe a bit worse than in witcher. i met some bugs and lags, but i played 30h and got crashed only once. i haven't got the best pc, so i played on the lowest possible options and still game was great looking. this game have to be repaired, but don't get suprised if your 7 yo ps4 isn't taking it well. i think it's one of the best game i ever played"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,this game is just infinitely bad. npc behaviour is the worst i have ever seen  i don't even want to speak of ai here because there is absolutely no intelligence involved. the game world feels completely empty and dead. there is absolutely nothing to interact with or worth exploring. gameplay is just clunky and bad. the loot system and armor system for clothing feels extremely out of place. there are a million gameplay and graphics bugs and glitches. character creation  customization is the worst i have seen in the past 20 years. there is absolutely no immersion possible while playing this game. i'm not disappointed by this game because i was hyped about it as i was not hyped at all. it's just the worst game i have played in the past 15 years.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"after a long wait, anticipation, excitment, expectation that the developers of the acclaimed witcher 3 would produce another epic game, the result is embarassing. a fair percentage of gamers are content with the visuals and cinematic storyline, but i am certainly not one of them. the graphics in the 'open world' remind me of my very early days of gaming. the citizens roaming aroung night city could be mistaken for zombies from the walking dead. gameplay is almost non existant. they have overcooked the movie scenes and served up a shambles  in my opinion, not fit for playing on the overall majority of systems. gun combat is laughable, soldier of fortume 2 double helix had better physics nearly 20 years ago on pc. car driving is near impossible. i found to my amazment, it was quicker to walk around the city than drive as the frame rate suffered so much while driving vehicles. holywood created the storyline, but the game play is garbage. it is an interactive movie, not a game. requested a refund from steam, but sadly, went over 2 hours game play in testing and hoping my early perceptions of the film were mistaken. amassed over 500 hours on witcher 3, but lost interest after just 12 hours on cyberpunk. not sure where the 90 metacritic score came from, please enlighten us?"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"78 years in development and this game have the biggest dead open world in game history, side quests are boring, copy paste of each other, only maybe 4 missions are quite diffrent, story is rly short, morality choices mostly not even exist in this game, you mostly have only 1 option in missions, sometimes 2, world is totaly dead, even traffic lights are always green for you, even when you go back with your car and go again forward it will be always green, it completly summarizes how dead this wrold is, and not even try to pretend to be real. i won't speak about bugs, because every open wold game have such things but after 8 years, it should be just better and more polished. quests you mostly not even get from npc which stand in front of you, 99  of quests you get by phone, which totaly broke immersion for me, most of missions are scripted and are rly linear, i remember that before release devs told that there will be multiple options to play any mission like in true rpg, it was just an another lie. and yeah i beat whole game, even did every side quest mission, and must say it was rly painfull and boring, only played this because i paid for that and wanted achievements. it was the biggest disappointment of year 2020, and kinda very big scam for fans of cdp red. it just looks like it was created by very small studio, and was developed for year or two."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i will not even talk about the bugs this games was the most hyped game ever until now, we wait more than 7 years for him, and now it's here now i know why people say this game was overrated, i know why you guys praised this game so much, to much, and i start to know why. i expected more details, more animations, and more realism, i know it's an rpg, but is an rpg in the year 2020 if you know what i mean why is v the only person who ride a motorcycle in game?wtf the ai is soo dumb, lifeless, useless, is just there....whitout having a point gta 3 ai is a lot much better than cyberpunk 2077 cdpr invested more in marketing and in promoting the game, instead of investing in the actual game i think they knew that, because they've knew the game is not gonna be that good. is not even close of what witcher 3 did it is and always gonna be a titan in gaming to be honest, i buy the game just for romances and keanu reeves, and for respect for the people who worked on him. and the romances are the worstthe witcher 2 and 3, was more realistic when we talk about sex scenes, more of them they don't have any logic, they just happen without a logic i will not gonna give spoilers another issue, is the controls, i think are the worst controls in a video game ever, at this moment the graphics are not the best not even on the max settings what in the hell is street creed?, it's soo fcking useless, the only thig he gives you, is the access to anything you can buy i mean wouldn't it be better if when your street cred is high your treated with more respectfear across the city and in almost all interactions? i'm playing this game on rtx 2080ti oc i9 10900kf 32 gb ram ssd 3tb and the game still have frame drops, lag, stuttering, etc. another problem is the main story, is so short, 3040 hours max, i wanted a story at least long as the withcer 3 has or even bigger and the quality of the story is just oknothing special is just have a lot more endings but they are not the best more of the choices in the game are so useless, and they don't have a logic, are just there without a point to use them. the characters are not so memorable, like they were in the witcher 3 in the witcher 3 i started to care about geralt, about his decisons. and all the other characters from the witcher 3 are more deep and complex, the characters from cyberpunk looks so borring, and look like they are forced to say something the fact that youre supposed to start at the bottom and rise to the top of night city, yet never get an apartment upgrade, is unbelievable. cyberpunk 2077 is a reminder that no matter the hype we should not preorder games about night city there are a  ton of bds yet you cant watch any you cant rob stores you cant customize weapons and cars i really feel sorry for the devs anyone else disappointed you cannot shoot out of your car? this game could have been a real masterpice, like the witcher 3, but is just another overhyped fail anyway, another issue, is the  . the game need a lot more polish i would have love to play this game even at the end of 2021 i don't know if cdpr is a awesome gaming company or the witcher 3 was just luck, idk... they can fix the bugs, but the story and the gameplay never the worst part of cyberpunk isn't the bad gameplay. it's that it destroyed my trust in cdpr forever. cdpr do not deserve your forgiveness. i hate to say it, but this game is the biggest fail after anthem"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i am playing on a pc. i slowly upgraded it over the last year as it was 4 years old and cyberpunk is all i hoped for. after the first 56 hours of story line gameplay i was lost in the city. trying to find where to go and seeking a map online. that isnt a bad thing it is excellent. it is huge in a compact way. i run most places for the first 1015 hours if you enplore. cars are tough to drive but i got a bike. change the view and its awesome. easy to park. sounds great too. the quests are tough enough.  lots of stuff like spiderman to beat up random crime gangs. exploration is excellent. dark  dingy confined bright  open  lots of variation. characters are interesting with a lot of back story. keanu is an ass and easy to hate. well thats good too considering the story. i care about them. cdpr did a good job. i was up to 5am two nights last weekend to get a decent bit into the game. i played cyberpunk rpg back in the 90s and i think netrunning is very good. the game aptures how i imagined it. hacking and various aspects of futuristic cyberware etc. it is very good. the game isnt perfect. i have seen bugs where people glitch and traffic is terrible in the city cars exploded beside me at traffic lights but the game is so engageing i barely noticed. the atmosphere of night city is excellent sleep at day and come out at night.  it was a long wait and i didnt pre order it until dec 7th but loving the game. thanks cdpr i can see you making this better and better.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"good morning all ! today i want to publish my opinion on this game. i'm not used to posting a review on a game, but having been a real slap in the face for me, i think it deserves it.  to put my opinion in context, know that i was not particularly expecting this game. i was expecting it from afar, knowing more or less what to expect.  this game was a real slap in the face for me. from start to finish, the game makes us experience a lot of emotions. going from joy to sadness, from serenity to stress, from confidence to doubt, the game will make us react and feel a whole lot of emotions. we will also have to think about our choices, and this throughout the adventure because yes, in this game, our choices can each on their own scale change the course of the game. certain choices during the side quests can also have a affect the end s of the game. the writing quality is just perfect. as well for the main quests as secondary, the whole is coherent and fits perfectly with the lore and with this beautiful city that is night city. speaking of the city, is it truly extraordinary. it is teeming with life and things to see. the game map will give you a feeling of enormous freedom at times, and will crush and compress you at other times. the playing area is extremely cohesive and breathes life. its dark side may also hide some surprises from you. on the gameplay side, i found the game as a whole very enjoyable to play. the fps view really adds a plus to the immersion, especially in the cutscenes. the few sequences of unarmed combat are slightly more messy, but largely playable as well. driving a vehicle is good without being extraordinary, it is nevertheless extremely pleasant to explore the surroundings of night city on a motorbike, for example, in order to discover the landscapes and the magnificent points of view that cdpr has offered us in this title. as for the rpg and customization side, i found everything to be very complete and malleable. sometimes it lacks tutorials for some things, but overall everything handles pretty easily. it is really possible to create, equip and specialize your character as you want, which allows for a lot of different gameplay styles. as for the optimization of the game, i had no major worries about my configuration 3080  3600x  16gb  1440p, even if keeping 60 fps stable in the city center is not easy, even with a 3080. the ray tracing is however extremely greedy, so personally i deactivated it, and the game is still magnificent. in terms of graphics, the game is simply superb. the animations are consistent, and the facial animation adapted in real time is really a plus for the immersion. some sets are simply beautiful, both outdoors and indoors. regarding bugs, yes i had a few. but no bug really blocked me in my progress. most of the bugs are graphical, like animation bugs. i did not really have any blocking or annoying concerns throughout my adventure. so there you have it, in summary, i really loved walking around night city, and i already miss this little world. i can't wait to get my hands on future dlcs so i can dive back into this extraordinary world. i really recommend it to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a huge and cohesive world."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"a great game , a great story and an interesting variety of  most important thing in this game is the atmosphere, everything is alive and beautiful, cd red kept the bar after the witcher 3, optimization and bugs i'm sure they will fix with patches , i'm sure everyone will like it if the game has a sense of taste and brain."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this is one of the best game ever! yes, it has some bugs, but the characters, story, mechanics are better. my recommendation, play this game!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"despite all the technical problems faced by players of all gaming platforms at the start, only the pc version is truly the most playable and technically stable. but already judging by this version of the game, we can say that the game in the next few years will become a benchmark as a test of new gpus and cpus since cyberpunk is really a true nextgen for the most powerful pcs and consoles of the current generation ps5 and xbox series x. playing on the pc, i encountered a minimum of bugs and it did not spoil my impression of the game. the game from start to finish is great, and just a masterpiece. a huge and lively world, a lot of interesting quests, replayability, an interesting plot, and all the other rpg components. i'm not a fan of rpgs, but this game really surprised me very much and dragged me completely, plunging me into the wonderful world of the cyber future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"a very solid game with an engaging plot typical of cdpr games. the gameplay is nothing to write home about and is the biggest detractor, however it is competent for the most part. hacking is fun, stealth is largely fine, and gunplay is better than some in it's genre, but it is not an fps by any means. the world is also simply gorgeous definitely one of the best looking games currently available with raytracing, and a competent implementation of dlss means that it's fully playable enabled. performance leaves some to be desired, though applying most of the fixes removes most of the issues. bugs exist too, however if you are lucky enough not to run into them they won't taint the experience, and most aren't game breaking. overall a very solid, even fantastic, game brought down a bit by a disappointing launch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"game is awesome! main story is master piece, side quests also. it's 9, beacause of bugs, but i know they will repair it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,it's a fantastic game with fantastic graphics. the main story and side quests are very well designed. the gameplay is fun too. i could play without any problems and i didn't faced any game breaking bugs.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this is not the best rpg game i've ever played, but this is one of the best actionadventure game i've ever played. i don't know about console,  just played it on pc. its not perfect but glitches are acceptable. game is criticized so rough because people hyped. pros  open and living world. city is amazing, you can feel that you are in a dystopian world, and i think this is one of the most important thing in a video game.  character customizations, weapons, clothes etc.  story is perfect  game is fun, you don't want to quit  map is very big. there are lots of things to discover  even the side quests have very good stories. cons  glitches, bugs  performance issues for consoles and low pc's  skill tree is meaningless. there are lots of skills but game is not that long.  biggest problem, ai. it shouldnt be like this in 2020. after we experienced rdr2 ai, it's not acceptable. i'm neutral about combat system. i like it but some people says its not good. in summary, game is worth for its money and it will be game of the year for sure. but not the best game in the world, not the best rpg ever. this game has a lot of potential. if they can correct issues than it can be a lot better. so in my oppinion you shouldnt refund it yet. have fun!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the developer, cd projekt red, intentionally sought to hide the true state of the game on xbox one and ps4  opencritic, december 2020 i'm playing on pc. to me, performance is good, bugs are there and fixable, but this is not the point. the point is, cdpr has stolen money and delivered a product which is not what they told the customers it would be. a good and brief, 20hour storyline won't save a dumb, dead world. it will reach red dead redemption 2 depth a developer said last year. well, this is not the case. you're put in a world where civilians have most a single sentence to say, and a single reaction to danger where policemen appear out of nowhere literally spawning at your back. nobody drives a motorcycle apart from you. if you stop in the middle of the road, nobody is going to roadrage  they will just stare at you. you cannot buy food from shops that are everywhere  food graphics is awful btw. these are not things you can patch later. the ai in gta san andreas felt more realistic. if i think of the heights of 60 hours of rdr2 gameplay and then look at this, it's an utter disaster. the only way to actually enjoy this is 1 forgetting how much hype, money, and time was put in this game 2 not thinking of it as an open world. in fact, if you compare it to ffxv for example, it works quite well as an action rpg"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have only played the pc version. cyberpunk 2077 looks sometimes very nice on my highend pc but the game world feels life and soulless. there are many obvious flaws, for example the ai of the enemies and npcs is laughable bad. there are so many obvious bugs and constant crashes. it is in insult to the consumers to release a game in such a broken state. thankfully i could get a refund."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"superb game. terrifyingly huge. deep and polished rpg, with more content than some games that are 5 years plus, with multiple patches. but this also gives a very sharp learning curve. and then are the bugs, in a dozen hours play, i've been stuck in the environment several times, immortal once, had to abandon quests and reload due to enemies being stuck. of course, this will all be fixed and then it's a clear 55 game. i don't think the bugs are game breaking on pc, and i'm actually very impressed by graphics dlss is the saviour on a 3700x with gtx 2060."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"un vero gioco nextgen, un capolavoro che, come molti altri presenta dei difetti, che nella versione pc tuttavia non compromettono l'esperienza. consigliatissimo su pc e console nextgen quando arriver la patch dedicata."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"shiny wrapper, empty box. gorgeous next gen graphics, uninspired bland gameplay. driving was a nightmare, how does the camera not follow while turning? the npcs were realistic looking enough but clearly acting as game ai which just had a very uncanny valley effect. at least genital physics have made progress since conan exiles."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game is a masterpiece. at least on pc. it looks phenomenal. there are zero performance issues on highendpcs. i maxed out the settings with my 3080 and have solid 60 fps. it has minor bugs though but the overall experience is very very good. there are no game breaking bugs so far. i don't mind minor visual glitches, this can be fixed. a fundamentally content lacking or broken game can't be fixed, whis is not the case here. i experience some occasional crashes on pc with version 1.04, could be related to gog. the main story is breathtaking. i played as nomad, on hard difficulty. the game is challenging which is good in the beginning, but as soon as you progress and find good weapons and upgrades it gets better. the side quests are better than expected. i'm not sure how or when cdpr will fix the lastgen console version. i feel sorry for them. i really hope over the years we get cool dlcs and mods on pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,i could just write a short review and say the game was breathtaking and end it there however that would not do this game justice. from the beginning and up until those credits roll this game takes you on a full ride of emotions. i have never been so attached to such a extreme to any characters or story in a video game until cyberpunk. i was originally gonna rate this game a solid 9 expand
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"playing on rtx ultra settings and this is easily one of the best open world rpgs i have played to date. yes there are a few bugs but in 20 hours  gameplay i have seen a handful, nothing game breaking though and all open world games have a few bugs. the world is both stunning and immersive with loads to see and do. highly recommend if you love sci fi and open world role playing games."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i did not have gameofthecentury level expectations so enjoying it as hell. plot, characters and the city itself are the things which make me to forgive a few flaws which this game definitely has. though have a pretty decent pc and haven't faced any major issues yet."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the community feedback is legitimate the game is riddled with visual glitches, poor performance and optimization. it's very clear that somewhere down the line mismanagement happened to cause this game to not be as good as it could be. the policing system is broken, cops spawn right behind you no matter where you are and no matter how large or small the offence. loot needs an overhaul, every shotgun feels the same, every revolver, pistol, etc. legendary and epic weapons don't feel stronger or better than their counterparts, and you'll replace them in 210 minutes for a better one. armor wise it's no different, you cycle through gear as if the whole game is a fitting room, and nothing ends up matching as a result. there's no option to hide your headpiece so you either take a hit to your armor score, or look like an idiot wearing a bikersamurai helmet everywhere you go. perks can be redestributed in exchange for an exuberant amount of money, stats cannot. all that being said, i can't put the game down. i love it. it's story, graphics, gunplay, exploration and voice acting outshine the flaws in a major way, and i love every minute of it that i'm playing. it's not the kind of it's terrible but i can't put it down like destiny or wow is, but rather an insanely good game with some glaring issues. if you have a rig that can handle the game properly think 48 core processor and at least a 2060 rtx card, i can still reccomend it in it's current state. if you don't meet those requirements, or want to play it on xbone or ps4, i suggest waiting for performance patches."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"short review  this game misses the finishing touch yet. that said, if they achieve to polish it like they did with the witcher 3, this game might be clearly amazing in the next 6 month. so far i would give it a 710 but since there are so many haters around and since this game deserves some love i'm giving it a 10 if cd project red goes broke, they won't fix the game. full review  night city is probably the most visually stunning environment i have seen in a game. the problem is, that's about all this game has going for it. yes it looks amazing, but a lot of thing are currently lacking. let's start with the character customization. in all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this game would be about. what we got, however, was unremarkable. aside from customizable genitals which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games. many of the npcs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. in terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. to make matters even worse, once you've created your v, that's it. you can't change your appearance any more. despite the fact that the ads implied in night city, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics. the next thing i want to talk about is character choice. aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over v's personality or choices. v essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. for example, i chose corpo as my lifepath. after the very first introductory mission, v went from being a cold, calculating corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. i had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes. the world itself was also a let down. i went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. but what i found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. yes there are tons of npcs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. it is completely static, and the ai leaves a lot to be desired. as many have already pointed out, the ai seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. that's it. the police ai are a complete joke. if you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. in the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere. i found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment. i was also disappointed with v's apartment. you get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. on top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. i also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. you spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point a to point b. everything i listed this far can be fixed except for the v's personality part i guess, like hairdressers were added in the witcher3 with a dlc, they can and should do the same for this game. changing your apartment in the game could also be an easy fix, the game doesn't lack empty buildings. the ai can also be fixed, having the police chase you with cars should not be too complicated to do and so on... i still believe this game can be turned into the masterpiece we are all waiting for, just stay tuned."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the best game i ever played, i didnt saw any bugs or glitches, its perfect, i have dream my hole life about a game like that, its huge and beautiful, its the second game that i cry about, amazing feeling, perfect quest and story, i love fighting in this game, you have so many choices . there is more but i have to play. wake the  up samurai we have 100 hours to play."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"after 14 hours of gameplay i have not experienced a single game breaking bug. i am not saying they do not exist, i am merely explaining my review score. i have experienced three instances of bugs in the 14 hours of gameplay and they were all minor a floating cellphone, cigarette etc. a lot of noise has also been made of performance. i am running this game on a rtx 3070 with an i7 8700 and 16gb of ddr4 ram. i have been playing this at high settings, no rt, dlss set to performance mode, 4k output upscaled of course. i have experienced a locked 60 fps in all instances at this settings. from what i understand it has not been running particulalry well on older hardware and that is regrettable. it is also worth noting that the game is performing better after the hotfix as well as the nvidia's driver. i have seen a lot of people being upset because the hype and the reality of the game have not lined up. this reminds me of some of the critics users complaints around witcher 3 when it came out. that game did not line up to an e3 video and people raged as a result. it was a buggy performance mess when it came out, and people consider it one of the best games of our last generation. this has not impacted me because i always, always, take the hype train with a pinch of salt. do not trust corporations, they will spin, they will play fast and loose with the truth. you just need to figure out if there is enough truth for you. in this instance, this game lined up with my expectations and as such i am very satisfied. i have thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay, the vistas, the music, the character designs, the dialogue, the guns. i have enjoyed it all. i know that there are people who have not, and that is cool. we can like different things. some things i would like to see cdpr sort out is better accessibility settings, be better about epilepsy really, this one should have never gotten through the gate, and crunch an industry wide problem, even in my industry which is online education. my reviewing this game favourably is not giving them a free pass on those things. i genuinely enjoyed this game but would also like to see them do much better in future."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have an i59300h, gtx 1650, 8gb ram. the game has a lot of dips, but typically runs at 60fps  on minimum settings. even at the minimum, it looks nice. there are bugs, but they didn't make the game difficult for me. i did not turn off. the story is very good, extensive side missions, many interesting facts. i have 20 hours. i'm playing great. i recommend to everyone. if they fix the bugs it will be 1010"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have waited for this game like 8 years, was super hyped and disappointed when they changed the date few times. i was not surprised that people will complain, they always did crysis, far cry, assassins creed everybody with weak pc setups or previous gen consoles who couldn't launch the game at day 1 went straight to the net to write  reviews. but all the others are just playing this gorgeous looking game, listening to all of those perfect stories, watching all the drama, jokes or looking for easter eggs. this game is not perfect technically, but the story, gameplay and visualssound are just 1010. so what it crashed like 10 times? i just launched it again, and again and again. i wish i had some more time to play. it is something new, refreshing. ac origins was fun. far cry 3 was fun, but after few copy paste versions cyberpunk is just something different, better. i am very happy with what cdpr accomplished and i am 100 sure they will deliver more hotfix and patches on the way. it was the same situation with the witcher 3. but some silly bugs does not matter with game like this. with story like this. with all of those dialogs, guns, clothes, perks, missions, cars, bikes and tons of interesting stuff to do. just try it yourself"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i love this game. even tho some promises weren't kept, it doesn't affect experience of the game. people forget that this game isn't sandbox, it's an rpg, it's made to tell a story, story of v we can customise a bit, we don't create his story, we affect some part of it and how it'll end. nothing more. lifepath prolog showes us how v ended up in night city and situation he is currently in. expected it to be a little longer but still the meaning is here. i felt connection to v since the very beginning and how prolog ended really hit me and what was lore about i don't want to spoil too much. relations with characters felt just like real, both platonic and romantic even tho there isn't too much characters you can romance. leaving the story behind which is 1010! well gameplay isn't the best one, it's notacibly rushed, it's not terrible either only 4 years of development some people will say it's 8 but first 4 years were only exploration in the universe since most people were still working on the witcher 3, the ai is not the best, but if you expect a good story it is not bad, for sandbox part is doing side quests, exploring etc. and for the last thing  bugs and optimization the game suffers from them like every game after release, especially after long crunch develompent, but i expect fixes for those problems bug fixes and ai so overall they won't affect my score much. can't wait for it's future development"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,best game i ever play. story is enjoing . there have some bugs but for me there was not important. i think people who say cyberpunk is worst game ever dont remind its a game its can't be petrfect . dude ! the haste did not help the premiere. give them time for patch.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i have played this game for 30 hours now and i am loving it. i have encountered a few visual bugs and two bugs which i've had to reload a save but the story and writing in this game is amazing. i have completed many side quests which have the same amount of detail and story as the main quests. the world is so immersive and makes you want to play for hours every day. if you can't wait to play this game i would highly recommend picking it up. this game did need a bit more dev time but over the coming months cdpr have promised to fix the bugs that some players are experiencing. i would give this game a 1010 if the majority of the bugs were fixed, but as there are quite a few visual bugs i would give this game a 910. i am playing with an rtx 3070 and ryzen 7 3700x."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'm about 50 hours in and  for me  the game's great. the writing, characters and immersion are superb, the setting is absolutely stunning i expected nothing less in those areas and i'm impressed nonetheless. the main story is captivating to me so far, though i have not finished it yet. i was more surprised with the gameplay though  for me it's really fun, if not groundbreaking. the first few character levels are a bit more uninspiring but i managed to develop my v quite quickly in a way that suited my style of play, and the three different weapon styles power, tech and smart offer enough variability to make gunplay more interesting. playing on hard difficulty, i'm pleased with the feel of combat  enemies of similiar level are definitely not bullet sponges and they deal quite a lot of damage, so combat to me feels dangerous and satisfying. driving is a bit whacky with some vehicles but honestly it's not that bad. driving a motorbike in first person through the city is really fun though. there are bugs, but in my experience way less than i expected based on reddit outrage. honestly for me it's way less buggy than something like fallout 4 or god forbid nwn2 at launch. police chase system is a garbage dumpster fire, have to agree there. i don't much care because the game is not about shooting random people in the streets, but the system is really bad. it can be easily patched though. basically zero performance problems for me amd ryzen 7 4800h, 16gb ram, nvidia rtx 2060 6gb and the game looks beautiful playing with ray tracing medium settings. i'm not giving a 10 because it has some issues, but 9 points is an accurate description of my experience just after launch. i believe that with patches and good dlc's the game is more than capable of being a 1010 gaming experience. that being said it sure  to play this game on ps4, but the pc version is great."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"my experience with cp2077 have been a blast, compared to rd2, gta5, skyrim and witcher 3 release this have been the best, least bugs and crashes so far. people with goldfish memory dont remember that there havn't been a game released since solitaire that have been released without any flaws. this game is obviously more demanding than i thought it would be. alot of criticisme of the game is very similar to what the original crysis got. lets compared to it to the last cpr game i still remember the lag and poor performance in novigrad on my first play through of witcher 3. most problems with world and glitching after viewing other's playthrough is related playing on too high graphics. glitches and bugs i have encountered with high fps are less than a handfull after 10 hours of questing and exploring. you can obviously see that having 50 npc's on your screen at the same time will hinder your fps, especially if you aim to have above 120fps. thats the hard choice between immersion or csgo gameplay. my tally of cp2077 huge world with layers, unlike nms and rd2 with a flat boring world, with tons of npc's and a living breathing world. this is the first real try on a realistic city. story with choice next gen title demands hardware like crysis, tho' that was unexpected when its released on original ps4 and xbox. how autosave functions is one of the best implemented into a game so far. lack of sli support lack of ultrawide support some ai issuesvery easy to trick npcs ingame. no matter the difficulty."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"good game with a good story. not a 1010 like the incels scream it is but if the game gets its bugs fixed id say its a pretty comfy 910. night city is fun to explore and the details throughout the world can be breathtaking at times. npcs have great designs the music is amazing and its all very immersive. the story all though a little short is fun and kept me playing for extended sessions. you could probably beat the game in 15 hours if you just go for the main missions but that would be a mistake i feel as the side quests are just as good as the story missions in terms of mission structure and world building. my only real complaints are that this is not a role playing game in any proper use of the term. its not fallout 4 levels of bad but nowhere near as good as new vegas. its more similar to deus ex human revolution but just below it in terms of rpg elements. there are stats which you have to build a character around but all can complete the game with similar results and character builds sadly are not important. you cant become a smooth talker or anything that can get you through the game without killing or never being detected. i didnt follow the hype for this game but i was under the impression it was an rpg so i would warn you going into it that its rpg lite if that is important to you. graphically the game is nice but the fps is pretty poor, im lucky enough to have a new rtx 30 series card and am able to play the game on max settings but there are areas when driving my fps will go to 41fps at 1080p. also making changes to graphic settings has little effect. playing with rtx on is the same as off for me, above 90 fps for most of the game but 41 in other zones when driving so it may be an issue with the games optimization since it runs bad at all settings. you may need at least a 2070 or higher to run in current state. lastly there is the bugs, performance may vary but i havent had really many crashes, only two although one required me to restart my pc as it froze everything. bugs are everywhere in this game and although its not fallout 76 bad i would recommend holding off until a few more patches are out as it can get in the way of the experience and its possible my love for the game has been hampered by the bugs even though i can look past most bugs if the game is good. although i recommend the game it comes with a asterix and you should wait till it is patched and the performance improves as it could be a rocky experience depending on your personal rig and the games launch price is pretty steep. reason why im not giving the game a lower score is because im pretty confident cdpr will fix the issue soon as they have a decent enough track record and even with the bugs this is better than anything ubisoft has put out in years."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"it simply is witcher 3 on steroids. to put it in layman's terms, the feels it gives is unmatchable."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"even ignoring the horrible constant bugs, 7 years in development, multiple delays or the heaps of cut content from wall running, classes, deflecting bullets with katanas, ect the games pretty bad. as an rpg the choices in the main quests literally do nothing, only thing that changes anything is sidequests unlocking different endings. the characters for the most part are all unlikable including johnny. johnny flip flops from being a massive  head to being your buddy all the time with zero consistency, even after doing his side quests to get him to like you more it doesn't reflect how he treats you in the rest of the game. the only truly likeable character in the game had their death spoiled in the  e3 trailer when they announced the game and it was very early in the game too. drivings okay besides the motorcycles which are horrible. ais broken where they just constantly stand around. the loot systems unhyperboliclly the worst thing i've ever seen in a game where you're being flooded with gear constantly, having to constantly micro manage it through the massive lists of garbage to see which ones an improvement. you need to constantly micro manage your gear too since its a rpg which means damage you deal is all based off your level and the level of your gear, plus payouts for doing jobs are insultingly low so you need to pic up all the gear you can to afford anything. augmentations are pretty lame in general, and they don't even show a difference on your character model besides 4 arms. quests are all very mediocre to open world pack filler garbage of clearing out an area of random goons dotted all over the map in different ways. there were only 3 decent side quests and one was only good for its concept because you have zero actual choice in it which is insanely infuriating. shooting combats okay, its hard to mess up pointing at something and it dying, but the way loot works means you just can't fight higher level enemys which is horrible, especially on harder or higher difficulty which just ruins shooting all together unless you do stealth headshots the whole game. melee is pathetically limited in options light attack, heavy attack, and block. its just mindlessly flailing like skyrim but on higher difficulty its the best since you just stunlock anything to death easily compaired to unloading magazines into people to try to kill them with a gun. the games very unbalanced of just using quick hacks to kill everyone without them ever detecting you, melee doing crazy damage while stun locking anyone including the 3 bosses to death in 4 hits or crafting just breaking the game with armor upgrades that make you unkillable while making stupidly powerful weapons. the game is painfully slow leveling up skills, after 35 hours i was only able to get pistols to 1020 when its what i primarily used the entire game. also, the game awards exp to the weapon you're holding when you complete a mission so that means full sneak or hacking only type characters don't get that bonus exp they'd be able to use making them level even slower. the police in the game are horrible where they literally teleport in droves behind you if you accidently shoot or hit someone in a crowd, which will constantly happen since if you get in a shoot out, npcs will just crotch and act as cover for the enemys so you can't use things like shotguns, grenades or your rocket launcher arm to fight them. police also will come kill you if you hurt the criminals they send you warrants for that are wanted dead or alive. cdpr is also scummy in this situation too where they sent dmca take downs to people who were trying to show the how buggy the game was before launch and forced reviewers to not use their own footage in their reviews. its super clear they knew how bad this was and wanted to cover it up as much as possible. i refunded my copy of the game, i suggest you just watch it on youtube if your interested. i regret the time i spent playing it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,a great game with a fantastic world to experience and get involved. there are alot of bugs and i don't care i am waiting 7 years for this game and i will insist until there is no content left. thanks cd project
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i could just write a short review and say the game was breathtaking and end it there however that would not do this game justice. from the beginning and up until those credits roll this game takes you on a full ride of emotions. i have never been so attached to such a extreme to any characters or story in a video game until cyberpunk. i was originally gonna rate this game a solid 9 due to all the minor bugs but after those credits rolled i felt so emotionally attached and impacted that it would have been unfair to rate it anything less than a 10. once cdpr fixes a lot of the performance issue people seem to be having and bugs this game will hands down be the game of the decade. i managed to do a spoiler free playthrough and i payed little attention to any media coverage of it after the release which is why i was so surprised by the negative review this game is getting. after reading some of the negative reviews it is apparent most of them never participated in side content or got to experience the amazing endings of the game. also, many reviews seem to be posted right after the game launch which would mean they never even got far into the game let alone completed it. most of the legit criticism seems to be about the bugs and performance issues which from what i have seen is an issue on older gen consoles the most. as we have seen with cdpr's handling with the witcher 3 and its own super buggy start i am confident cdpr will address most if not all of the issues with cyberpunk. i am happy to see the user review score is increasing rapidly and i know that is because people are actually starting to finish the game and have experienced what i have experienced. all i must say is this is a game that you need to complete to fully understand and appreciate. trust me when i say it is 100 worth it."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"im on a ps4 pro with my cyberpunk 2077. but i really want people to see honest reviews and experiences with this game so im posting it on both ps4 and pc. this game does nothing new at all. wheres all promised features and genre changing stuff they talked about and held the game back in development for 8 years for? this game is a huge buggy mess. textures don't load i can see through the world. it feels like this game has huge memory leak issue. if you move around or drive around, its no wonder they took out flying cars for players. the world doesn't load in and often you can stand around having done nothing and objects will be floating, npcs will pop in out of no where. the ground wont even be there. smh. so done with the gaming industry and all the  instead of spending all that money on keanu reeves and music bands, i like keanu but the music is garbage, a simple fallout 34 style talk radio station that plays a few tracks of music that had cyber tronica or edm would have been clever and a lot better. the storys ok but the bugs are just kicking my ass. im at the point and barley into act 2 where i just don't even wanna play. soon as i get into the game it crashes or spaz's out or something happens not due to even playing the game that just is hugly off putting. give it a year maybe they'll fix some bugs and it'll be playable. this just flat out reminds me of fallout 76's  all over again, a trend that is getting way to common place in the gaming industry. releasing trash and telling me its truffle laden gold."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"despite the ton of hype and promises, the game is hugely underwhelming. now, let's ignore all the bugs and crashes. even with the beautiful world on pc, the core mechanics are broken. simple features which are missing render, such as the minimal zooming out when driving, renders driving a chore."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i literally had to make an account just say how i'm  furious about people complaining about things like movement system, dogde in particular some braindead people stating it is a  fps or even armour system cause they can't look good without using armour... how dense are you dumbasses? really that's what you complain about? i understand thye bugs and stuff cause i also expirience them but in my 40 hours of play time i had to reload once... once. i know that there are some visula bugs but what the  are you on about? this is a absolutely massive game and bugs are everywhere. remember ac unity's launch? remember bf4 launch? diablo 3? gta5 on ps3? stop crying motherers. this game was not in development for 7 years simply becasue cdp is a small studio compared to the other major ones. oh and did you forget they also dropped a little game called witcher 3 in the mean time? yeah i'm sure these guys just worked on cyberpunk ever since the teaser. about graphics i don't even know what to say. it looks gorgeous and i'm playing on gtx 1660 super and as a person who played for many years on absoliute garbage pc i can truely appriciate how this game looks. downgrade? you can check on what kind of pc cdp played that demo ffs. i don't care that i get 4050 fps on highultra yes you can try changing the setting to achieve that with drops to 2030 but i'm not complaining! about the world yes the npcs could have been better as well as the ai but lore you learn through the side quests is absolutely awesome and addicting to some exstent. btw the side quests and world activities work the same as in witcher 3 so i don't know how people didn't have problem with that but have with this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i'm playing it on pc and apart from the occasional floating item i haven't encountered any game breaking bugs or crashes. i've played a little over 40 hours and so far i absolutely love it, can't wait to see how cdpr improves the game and i'm looking forward to more content being added to the game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game has been overrated  overestimated. apart from tons of bugs and series optimization, the game itself is very boring. the main quests are boring, side quests are even worse! interaction with npc cannot compare with red dead redemption 2, customisation is very limited. you better off saving your money for something else. all in all, do not buy this game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"in trailers, this game looks damn good, but when you play it, feels like u go back in 2007 and play a game from that time note for this game !? zero! why ? well, when you see the others giving a 10 out of 10 and wrote such an abomination the best game ever to a game who could be the the best game ever in 2010, but not in 2020, i couldn't give it more then 6 or 7,but we must keep a balance for this game, so others don't fall in the trick, sorry to say i dont like the last assassins game, but this one is even worse than that, so i won't bother to write why, it's the first game that doesn't deserve anything to say about it, it's pure garbage in all aspects, a shame for that famous studios and their mighty and beautiful still game, the witcher, and i still can't believe it this one is so bad"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"trans people of color are highly mispresented in the game and heavily sexualized. cdpr has once again shown they do not intend to forsake their bigoted, outright fascistic ways and cyberpunk is a proof to that also, the bugs are everywhere"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i fell in love with this game. it's world and story are amazing. it can be seen that the developers put their soul into that, but marketers made a lot of mistakes with early announcement and supporting ps4xbox1 version. it's good that cdpr said, that you can get money back for a ps4xbox1 game that you have already played. yes, there are bugs, but it is nothing in comparison with the world and gameplay. combat system is good, weapons are different and interesting. graphic is really good even on my lowmid pc ryzen 2700x  1080 ti  ultra settings on fullhd, and it looks beautiful, all these buildings, lights, technics. i can't understand those people or children, who complains about graphics on really low pcs, what did you expect from modern game? and may be i'm too old, but i think that graphic is not the main thing, the game is great without that. it's useful to note a large number of easter eggs. stories on chips are interesting. they really dip in this crazy world. all of the main missions are highly interesting. and side missions are not far behind, if it is not trivial kill or theft you can skip them if you want. all bugs that i met wasn't critical like crash or something similar. maximum  reload from control point in mission. but the game is missing some things, like character editing after creation, cars modifying, more intelligent ai. i think that some of them will be added in future. i hope that the developers will fix bugs and optimize game soon."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,not without its issues but this is an utterly astounding game. when the dust settles this will be considered a masterpiece.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"the game isn't perfect by any means. i played on ps4 and i got a ton of gamebreaking bugs for the first 23 days. after that, things seemed to smooth out a bit, but in my total playtime of 39 hours i experienced 14 different crashes. bad, i know. right now, the game sits at an 8, but during the following weeks, the game is going to get patched big time. if those patches completely change the game, open every gamer's third eye, reveal the secrets of the universe, and then make every pillpusher this side of the appalachian mountains hold hands and sing kumbaya, i'll give it a 9. for now, it'll just sit at an 8. this game isn't perfect, which is why it sits at an 8, but when it shines i'm staring at solid gold. people have been complaining that there's too much dialogue, but people also loved the witcher 3 and red dead for that. people have complained that there isn't a whole lot of choice in the dialogue, giving them only 24 options in most occasions. these are also the same people that praised the witcher 3 for the exact same thing. i've played a ton of rpgs divinity 1 and 2, wasteland 2 and 3, every fallout game, elder scrolls games, atom rpg, dragon age a lott'a the good stuff new and old. cd projekt red doesn't really make rpgs in the classic sense, they just make rplights. is that wrong? no. the game was advertised as an arpg with choices and such similar to the witcher franchise. is that not exactly what we got? what did you want? 30 ways to say yes, no, or maybe? we didn't get a garbagefire system like fallout 4 and we didn't get a perfect system like new vegas. they worked with what they had in terms of having two simultaneous voice actors male and female for each given line and allowing players to give v their very own personality. the writing in the game is insane. it's engaging, the dialogue is realistic, the romance scenes are actually endearing instead of making me want to rip my eyes out and find them a new home in my blender like ac odyssey did, and there wasn't a moment of it that i wasn't interested in what was happening next. all of your choices will impact some part of the game, but not all will impact the ending. every choice is recognized. as long as they're not brushed off, it's fine. it's about the journey, not the destination. too many games focus on saving the world and involving you in a plot that you couldn't care less about. this game takes a much different approach and puts you into a story only comparable to the best in the business. keanu reeves made this game a million times more engaging for me as johnny silverhand and v's relationship is one of the core pillars of this game. i can't say anything more about the story and writing without spoiling it, but just know that if you're there to be entertained, you will be entertained. the gunplay is fine. it feels tight and smooth like your mother. i don't have too much to say on it, as it is no cod or borderlands, but it serves the game fine enough. the melee combat is atrocious, though. your camera spins around like your head is on a swivel and the dodging mechanic just doesn't work. your own hit box is broken and this is very clear in the fight club questline where your opponent will punch you from 10 feet away and slice your health bar in half. i'm assuming this will be fixed in a patch, but for now, i'm just avoiding the final fight because i don't feel like resorting to glitches. the driving is good in the lowerend cars, but when you get to faster ones, it feels very slippery and a bit floaty. i'm assuming this will be fixed in a patch. the city itself is the most complicated i've ever seen designwise. however, in terms of its inhabitants and how deep your interaction with the city goes, it's a bit shallow. i'd compare the interactionlevel to the game sleeping dogs, because funnily enough, hong kong isn't too dissimilar from a dystopian hellscape 57 years into the future. however, in sleeping dogs, if you pulled out a gun people would react in a frightened manner. this does not happen in cyberpunk. if you get into an altercation with the police, you can do a bunch of crazy highspeed chase stuff in sleeping dogs, and there is at the time of this review no openworld police chases in the game. police will teleport behind your character until they get a reasonable distance away and lose their wanted level. needless to say, this is pretty embarrassing, and takes a point away. however, the city itself is the best ever seen in a video game. it surpasses every other game in sheer scale and beauty, and that is because the city is built upwards, not outwards. a true cyberpunk fantasy. cyberpunk 2077 is a buggy masterpiece that needed some more time in the oven. i only hope that its reputation is not forever stained, because it is the witcher 2 of this franchise. they have gotten the formula down, they just need to expand upon it in the next game."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"i think this game is great, ive gotten very engaged in the story and love the characters. the attention to detail is very good and though there are some bugs ive barely encountered any and none have been game breaking. though i am running an rtx 2080 and i78700k which is quite a bit more capable than what an average console or pc user has. i think if this game is given time it will improve with everyones hate for the bugs and ill optimization. i honestly dont understand how anyone could play this game without dlss. i use dlss and it improves my frames by nearly three to four times depending on the mode. i know most people dont have an rtx card and thats quite sad because i feel nvidia could put dlss on gtx if they really wanted t, but i guess i understand they wanna make money and what not. i can say though that ftc and console users arent missing out on the ray tracing features. though the ray traci does look pretty damn good it drops frames to nearly unplayable and with ray tracing i average 2030 fps with dlss on ultra performance ive tried turning dlss off before to see what it would run and it was 3 dps. though if you do have something that is able to run this game reasonably well the game is very good. the though detail and narrative are incredible imo, ive never gotten this hooked on a offline open world game like this. i love the setting, the soundtrack is incredible. the characters are very well developed. and keanu reeves is there for a lot of the time. i feel if you give this game some time it will probably pull a no mans sky and better its optimization and bugs. after all it most likely would have delayed more if so many fanboys were going complete ape  about this game and how it was going to change their lives and shut. at the end of the day its just a game, but i think its a really good one and is definitely worth playing and if you have something nice enough to run it the game truly does look amazing. my friend saw me playing it one time and though i was watching a movie or something from how realistic it looked."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"minor bugs, but story, world and mechanics are amazing. for me it's goty of 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"well, where to start. feel sorry for the studio, they came up with a crazy good game which unfortunately is held down by very badly performing consoles. looking at the complexity of the world i knew that chips in last generation consoles will not be able to handle it very well hence i was expecting average performance. it's a series of unfortunate events for them. consoles launch is completely rigged by scalpers, graphic cards availability is super low too. if we would have more new generation consoles available that launch would have looked way better for cp. now, more about the game. sunk 50 hrs into a game half way through the main story having absolute blast living my corpo character life in the night city. it is the first game since maybe last of us, that i am playing and not realising i just played 7hrs straight. time flies when you play this game, i am so immersed that this game is truly breath taking. night city looks great, graphics are bad ass. love the fights, cars physics are cool, motorbikes even better. great immersive story. perfectly written characters. crazy good side quests. you can play using so many styles. you can build your character in many ways. will definitely be doing another playthrough maybe even third. sick game, better than rdr2 for sure. that one bored me at the end. this one bloody can't wait when i step into night coty again. atmosphere lore,  crazy! apologies taken cdpr now make this game cyberpunk online and also vr!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-15,"this game is everything. amazing story, awesome graphics, even with a midrange pc."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"clearly an unfinished game. with a level headed mind going into the game, i expected reasonable things for a title that has been in the works for so many years by a large company. bugs are inevitable, but i didn't know i was playing skyrim level of bugs. so many things that were clearly meant to be implemented was scrapped. the ai is mindless and anything but intelligent. only artificial. cd red's clear intentions on screwing over their console customers does not help either. i luckily am playing on a high end pc with a 30xx series rtx card. and still the biggest mouse input lag ever. the immersion in this game is not there either. can't even sit down anywhere, no third person mode, everything halfaed. this game needed a minimum of another year to finish."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i wish less sexual issues were addressed. fairly good gameplay, good graphics"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"look, i think that people have been whipped up into a frenzy about this game, be it the bugs, poor performance, or lack of rpg elements. but at the end of the day, i have been having a great time with this game. of course the bugs are bothersome, and they are so common to the point where i am used to them, but looking beyond that for a second, the game underneath all of this is very fun. the experience of simply being in night city is amazing, and at times when the bugs subside, the game is incredibly immersive. this game does lack many rpg elements i think many people were expecting, but why don't we take a step back for minute and look at the game for what it is, rather than what it isn't. bugs aside, it is a very enjoyable experience, and one of the most memorable video games i have played."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"im loving my time in night city, thanks cdpr! the game runs well for me and the story is great so far, it feels like a scifi shooter rpg  la mass effect. best played with keybord and mouse as the aim is wonky with controller. there are some bugs but i expected that from a new game and they will fix it like witcher 3. just thought id throw my review in as the game is getting a lot of hate now"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,when the game launched it sure wasn't a great experience at first. but i think they reviwed the game and now it's actually a really great game with an amazing story and characters.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i rate this game at 8 at this time however, i have no doubt it will evolve to be a 10. basic fact combat is solid. playing this on the ps4, it is probably the last major title for this console. for ps4 owners who want a ps5 but cannot get one, this will be the last major title for the awesome ps4 console system. i have experienced several issues however, i see the potential. not sure why the company had to issue an apology, but i am sure it was because of the feedback they had been receiving. i think that is cool but not needed. what my major issues were are that it took about 10 hours of gameplay to figure out key gameplay elements better documentation is needed for sure. at the same time, there are so many complexities, it would be hard to document all. there are so many features in the settings that are unexplained and undocumented so if we did not know any better, it would seem consumers are encouraged to purchase the game guide. anyhow, who really cares? these are just games. peace!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,played it trough and it was really good. you actually care about the characters and it looks really good. the only mediocre thing is the gameplay but as storytelling is the focus point i didn't mind it.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,amazing experience! the story is something different ! few small glitches during the playthrough but nothing unexpected or different from the other games.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i dont know why, but all the trailers and advertisements made the game look like the greatest game of all time, with fun characters and enjoyable missions with breathtaking visuals. but sadly, the game is filled with so many bugs and glitches that just takes away any form of immersion it can offer and even with my rtx 2060 i feel like games such as red dead redemption 2 and death stranding looks miles better than cyberpunk 2077. even assassins creed valhalla is a better game than this mess. missions wouldve been enjoyable at least if not for the bugs and glitches. people walked through objects, game freezes and things even the player just flies off randomly. this is not acceptable and the fact that the developers lied in their marketing materials and outright deceived us gamers theres no way to praise the game. i dont know how itll run on my ps4, but all i know is even games like tlou2 and ghost looks and runs extremely good on my ps4, but i highly doubt cyberpunk can. this game is the biggest gaming disappointment of 2020."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,it's a shame people want to meme and review bomb the pc version due to the failure of the last gen consoles... but the pc version of cyberpunk is great experience that will please fans of the witcher series.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"this was definitely worth the wait! the complexity and detail of night city make it the kind of world that never ceases to surprise. worldcharacter design and the writing are absolutely top notch. there will always be those who have built up 'their' perfect gaming experience in their minds, and will have a meltdown when a single aspect does not meet the standard of their personal fantasy. cyberpunk is an experience that truly reveals the passion of it's creators, building an adventure in the unique world of mike pondsmith, and taking the player on ride unmatched by other titles in today's market. if you're looking for a run  gun fps, it might be best to look elsewhere. if you're looking to join in a deep, everchanging adventure with complex, relatable characters, then boot up and jack in!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"perfect almost everything. minor bugs  i don't care about. good visuals even on old gpu 1060 3gb. it's the cyberpunk witcher i was looking for all those years! tried gta5 a lot of times, arkham knight made me forget to complete it just because all those games required to drive, c2077 has a perfect balance of this, you can just skip driving part for most of the times. going to compelte it now, and again later when i get 3080, and probably many more times."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"cyberpunk's story is one of the best i have ever seen and heard, many people are angry and rightfully so because of the bugs, i haven't seen any im playing on a i59400f and 1660ti but people forget that bugs and poor optimization can be patched."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"as is, bugs, optimization issues and all, this is still one of the best games ive played in 20 years of gaming. i dont know if some people were expecting to be actually literally transported to 2077 and leverage hardware from that year. seriously this game stands to go down as one of the best games of all time, and is in my opinion, revolutionary for open world rpgs as a genre. im sure cdpr wishes theyd have given this a bit more time in the oven, but im sure glad they didnt because im too in love to think back on the cold dark days before its release."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"terrific scifi rpg  shooter in a well designed, dense, urban open world. you don't get many games like that every year the gameplay is a combination of gta urban open world, driving, witcher rpg, far cry shooting, deux ex stealth. the scenery is gorgeous. this is a very colorful, very futuristic game. a pessimistic setup of a decadent civilization. ui and music join the photograph to offer a really nice immersion. i can't really rate the story, being at the beginning of it, but so far it has been a pleasant mix of big corp, conspiracy theories, secret technology,  you start the game with one of 3 social backgrounds. so i assume the game has some variety when it comes to the stories. with 20 hours of game, i have unlocked 6 of achievements. there are times when i ride the story, there are times when i take my time, no rush, to walk or drive in the city and try to improve my skills and my character by looting and arresting bad people bounty hunter kind of jobs. the map shows you a bunch of jobs, with diverse levels of difficulties. this is fun and rewarding. from time to time, you encounter a more difficult opponent and you know you need to go back to your previous district and get better. this is a summary to tell you how easy it is to enter the game, the rest is up to you to master it and deep dive into complexity. technically, games of that generation are reaching a level of movielike quality. ray tracing is adding an extra layer of aesthetics and immersion, like the bright light when exiting a dark building or tunnel. cyberpunk is going to be a benchmark for a few years to come. all in all, this is a unique game, a rare cyberpunk set, a fun mix of open world, shooting and character building. it's the type a game that you start for a quick 30min play and you end up spending 2 or 3 hours. i tend to believe disappointed people are the ones with too high expectations due to the intense media coverage. without it, i believe most would have praised the game. if you enjoy the combination of gameplays i mention in my first paragraph and are interested in scifi, night city awaits you."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"for all the advertising and hyping of this game, overall it was very disappointing. the customization is very underwhelming. nothing like what they had promised. a few sliders and very little options. the fact that you can't change your appearance is very suprising. the lifepaths that cdpr hyped, feel like they have no impact whatsoever. its just 1 hour of different lifepaths with no impact on the game except for a few dialogue choices. combat is fun, but the side missions get repetetive and do not feel as rewarding as witcher 3. ais are dumb. few bugs and glitches here and there, but after the driver udates pc seems to be fine. overall very disappointed, but only continue playing for the story. pros  story  characters  gameplay cons  customization  linear  meaningless lifepaths  ai"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"great game, good car control, good shooting, great story, awesome characters, cool atmosphere, great soundtrack optimization on pc is better than in recent assassin's creed but with such a strong pr campaign, something more was expected of course"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i'm enjoying plot, side quests and game play. yes, there is many bugs, but it all can be fixed"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"too many bugs, it's hard to get immersed into an item world when every second of the game something goofy happens that yanks you out of the immersion and reminds you it's just a game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"the game is broken on consoles and cdpr was incredibly dishonest leading up to release. hiding footage of the game and not giving reviewers access to the console version, removing things they said would be in the game hourslong prologues for each lifepath and the bounty system, and crunching after they said they wouldn't is super disingenuous. they knew that they were releasing an unfinished game and people are still defending them. these practices are unacceptable and should not be supported."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"honestly i love the game so much, a few glitches here and there, but so far it's already made me cry and in a good way. the story is amazing. sadly 10 wouldn't be accurate, but it's still amazing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i've put 32 hours into the game, finished the base story and while it was fun to drive the cool cars, drive through the cool city, i have come to the conclusion that this game is not worth your money. cyberpunk 2077 sells itself very well, especially in the prologue. i was  into the game, it seemed like the most ambitious game i've ever played, while cyberpunk 2077 is ambitious its overall underwhelming, driving through the city isn't as enjoyable as you'd think, the cars themselves handle ok, but driving through the city isn't satisfying except for the in game radio stations, the soundtrack is pretty good. cyberpunk 2077 has everything you'd expect, and that's about it. nothing really new and interesting. i dragged myself through the ending of the main mission which was left in the air. this game offers multiple play throughs and different life paths, but honestly i don't see myself playing this again. perhaps with future updates it will be something worth investing more time. i'm happy i experienced this game, it's not all bad, there are some amazing playable cutscenes, the vehicles look awesome to be frank. the city's design is pretty cool for the most part, but it still felt underwhelming, there are plenty of npc's, but overall this game feels entirely half baked. the writing is decent, but the overall story was interesting at first but my story's conclusion was lame and left in the air. dialogue isn't as in depth as i hoped, with few dialogue options that don't actually affect the plot, but offer a bit more lore or information. cyberpunks main missions are by far the best part of the game, as underwhelming and fragmented the story is, there are some cool missions that really  you in, only to be let down by the rest of the game. side missions are pretty generic, find stuff, kill people. there is plenty of clutter in night city to waste your time. overall it's well polished, but a turd nonetheless."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"this is the best game since witcher 3 and the best cyberpunk game since deus ex! graphics look amazing, the world is presented just like in the books, gameplay is fantastic and the plot is engaging enough so that i don't even want to waste time writing this review. i haven't noticed any gamebraking bugs so far."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,this game like dying light. i like it. this game contains good action good scenes good level design good graphics bad ai bad bugs bad main stories bad optimisation
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"this has been a really fun game to play i am running this game on 3 year old hardware and even though i had to lower the graphics to play i am still loving it. there are some parts of the game outside of performance that needs some polishing. improved driving mechanics the inventory menus should be improved in a few ways. i would like them to add the ability to favorite a weapon so you don't sell it or disassemble it on accident when crafting items they should change the press and hold to just a simple press to craft either lower the price of everything or increase the price you can sell things at. the grind for cash is way to slow. make it so you can get more components when you disassemble items. i see a lot of complaints about the game. all performance complaints are justified however the game itself is good. i have seen complaints about the ai which to me does not seem accurate i think the ai in this game are on par with the best ai in any other game. another complaint i've seen is that the story is too short or poorly written. from what i've seen this could not be further from the truth the only reason i could see them making this claim is if the just skipped all the dialogue for every mission because if you actually sat a listened to every mission npc you would actually have a pretty good story even from side missions that were added in. i particularly enjoy the cyberpsycho, racing, and boxing missions and i hope they add more of them in the dlc's they have talked about. i believe this game is worth playing and with some time they may be able to tune the game to run smoother on most systems. i will continue to play the game and wait in excitement for whatever dlc they decide to add. i'm sure in time this game has the potential to be as loved as the witcher 3 was."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"as of writing, cyberpunk 2077 is a phenomenal rpg, marred by numerous technical issues that detract from a truly immersive experience. tldr this is truly a 1010 rpg experience, outside of the technical issues. if you've always dreamed of a cyberpunkthemed skyrim or fallout, this is it, folks. playing on lastgen consoles is highly unadvisable, as the performance on ps4xb1 even the pro versions appears to be completely unplayable at the moment, so in that case, wait for further optimization from cdpr maybe a few months to a year, and hopefully there will be a playable version of the game on those platforms at that point. current gen consoles ps5xbs appear to fare much better, and i'd say those are the minimal specs for this game in its current state. pc is obviously the best way to go more details on my setup below. even though this is technically the pc review of the game, given how egregiously bad the performance is on lastgen platforms, i give the game an 8.510 which i'll be rounding to 9 here, with a pending 1010 if all technical issues are fixed in the near future which if cdpr's reputation has taught us anything, is very much likely to be the case. technical performance rating 710 i'm playing the game on pc on a 1080ti. at 23 hours, i've just begun act 2, and in this time i've run into many visual bugs e.g. floating objects, object popin, tpose npcs etc., none of which really impacted my gameplay experience too much. i've run into 1 questtracking bug that failed to progress the quest status, and this was solved simply by reloading my most recent autosave, and cost me probably only 12 minutes of playtime, as well as a random instadeath bug after landing on a rooftop just right, again forcing a reload probably a collision bug i am able to run the game at either 1440p with fps wobbling between 5060fps, or 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution with fps wobbling between 4555fps, and in both cases i'm able to turn several of the graphical settings to medium or high digital foundry has published a great tutorial on what settings to use or scrap given the performance vs. quality tradeoff, on different levels of pc specs, so be sure to check that out. i've elected to play the game with the latter settings, as the ultrawide resolution really makes the game pop. but standard 169 is amazing nonetheless too, even with a wobbly framerate. game designquality rating 1010 if we pretend that cp2077 has no bugs, and runs perfectly on all platforms, it's easily a 1010 for me. this is perhaps one of the most immersive cityscapes i think has ever been put into video game form. the streets of night city truly feel alive. the npc banter, chatter of the crowd, hum of car engines, random music blaring out of storefronts as you walk past, really make you feel like you're walking through a cyberpunk metropolis, and as your character accumulates more street cred an actual statistic that you gain levels in, you really feel like a badass that owns this playground of a town. i've spent hours exploring the city on foot just to see what i find, but if that's not your cup of tea, zipping through and checking quests off your list is just as fun. not only is the map huge, but it's packed with things to do and see. open world games often suffer from the miles of nothing problem, from skyrim, to rdr2, to breath of the wild, as amazing as those titles are, it's hard to ignore walkingrunninggalloping across wide expanses of emptiness  night city is packed to the brim with actual, interactable content, even if it's just a few gang members to kill here and there, or a food vendor to check out, or a joytoy to...talk to. the storytelling, thus far, has been truly amazing. cp2077 crafts an underground universe of mercenaries, contractorsfixers, and shady corporations, all of which you must expertly navigate to...solve your problem won't go into detail, but it's a very interesting problem. akin to other open world rpgs, there are plenty of side quests that offer engrossing storylines of their own, as well as gigs and smaller quests discoverable throughout the world that are a spin on the good old go here and kill a bunch of bad guys which you can skip if that sounds dry at this point. the game is also loaded with lore books called shards that you can peruse at your own discretion i've read every single one i've found so far, and it does add quite a bit. conclusion 8.510 overall, this game is for fans of a rpgs, b open worlds, c immersive storytelling and worldbuilding, and d the cyberpunk theme. if you fall into all 4 categories, this is a mustplay for you assuming you can run the thing. it really raises the bar for what openworld rpgs should be for next gen, and if you're the type of gamer that can sit back, tune everything out, and let a fictional world  you in, night city will be a great place to visit"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"cyberbug 2077, el juego tiene demasiados bugs, la ia es pesima. le falta un ao de desarrolo aun.. no pueden poner en venta un juego con estas caracteristicas. hasta que no sea corregido todo lo que debe no voy a cambiar esta resea"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i'm playing on ps4 pro, i'll give credit where credit is do, it's a beautiful game, those people that worked on a game deserve their pay and bonuses, every massive open world game lately to be released has had it's issues, glitches, bugs, and server issues, so what. as long as that developers are doing there best to fix it, that's what counts, 2 days after release, a 20 gb update comes out,this will get better soon, so i'm just not rushing through it. i've been enjoying just searching around, and exploring the city. and if you think the game is going to play and look the same on a ps slim x box s, and a high end computer you are delusional. i'm glad that they released this game at one price point, instead of like these greedy big companies that love microtransactions and making you pay for the game as well as every bit of content that is added! project red has already said dlc will be added for free and multiplayer will be coming my final thoughts are its beautiful, gritty world that was very thought out, it has endless potential to be added and built upon, i had problems also don't get me wrong, but i know they are not end of the world, and will be fixed!! i hope a lot of people understand and will give the game a chance because it's truly something special !!!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"at the moment i realize this was going to be first person i began to feel like this wasn't the game i was expecting, it does not make scene to sacrifice the whole visual customization only for a few shooter mechanics that are forgotable, and the fact that they name the game cyberpunk but they obvied the overpopulation that its a fubdamental caracteristic of this genrestyle it really drags me down, if you gonna apropiate a whole conceptat least make it right..."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,ok make a better one next time lol also the toyota prius is a very good car if i do say so myself
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"overhyped... if you take a look to the great movies, series, books and games based on the cyberpunk genre all of them are better than this lame intent to copycat not even gta but saints row, and ray tracing  i don't even know how that is a thing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i was expecting a good game, got something very original that keeps me hooked to it. the graphics, the story and the sheer feelz you get while in game is just something else. it keeps going, i already got more than i was expecting from it and am still in act two. let's get some things clear, amigo. this game has some issues, it is a very bold project from the polish cd project red. it has bugs and it has some balancing issues. i am sorry for the ps and xbox toons that got the short part of the stick. to be honest please stop spamming bad 0 reviews in the pc section, because it runs pretty sweet. and this is how it should be, pc first and foremost. i still do not understand why people choose to buy consoles, never did never will. second there are real issues with difficultylevel scaling. some mobs act like bullet sponges taking over 10 headshots and still they stand. later on there are random thugs that can just beat you to a pulp halfway in the game  this game takes it's rpg part seriously and some people might find it hard to keep an immersion when dealing with poor enemy scaling. the game promotes a certain kind of play at higher difficulty levels. it wants you to find the perfect weaponmodsabilities combo that will help you get superior fire power  again, just like an rpg. and that was all, the struggle explained. the struggle embraced, because this game is worth it. the rest is all good. it literally brings together sci fi elements from the 80's such as blade runner with the classics scifi anime like ghost in the shell. the world is so detailed without being over the top complex. it really feels like walking the streets of a proper movie or above mentioned anime. i am sorry for the people playing this on the wrong platforms and having issues, but this is a solid game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"playing on pc and haven't noticed any major bugs so far. game looks next gen and i can't stop taking screenshots... story is good, cyberpunk stuff is well executed... gun fights are satisfying with wide range of guns... hacking enemies and camera etc is also nice but somewhat similar to watchdogs... after all issues are fixed everyone gonna love this game. cd project red took some time polishing the witcher 3 but ultimately that became game of decade, finger crossed for cyberpunk fixes and upcoming dlcs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,superb gaming experience especially with its aesthetic design and the pure imagination towards the cyberpunk future portrayed in the game.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,whether this game is playable or not depends entirely on your definition of playable. can you functionally move through all of the missions from the start of the game to the end? sometimes. is the story content good? sometimes. were we all scammed by cdpr to believe there would be features in this game that are entirely nonexistent? absolutely. is the game still enjoyable despite this? depends on how much you can tolerate being lied to on a massive scale designed to separate your money from your wallet.
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,it is a fine game but definitely fails to match up with the expectations they sell to us .
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"would have given this game a 1010 review if the bugs weren't so bad, but it's going across 9 consoles so i can understand where prioritization does take place to look the best on the newest hardware as well as pc's. some parts of the game are bugged to the point where they're unbeatable. the mission titled stadium love is unplayable for me. my hands do occasionally go through the floor and rubberband but all in all this game has amazing depth, great sidequests and crazy ones too. can't wait to play on ps5 one day because this game is everything i'd hoped. just needs a little bit of tlc by the devs and it's a smash. good job guys! love the work so far and excited for the future of this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"the best game in the last 5 years! what i liked incredibly beautiful and detailed world, incredible interesting characters, the plot is very attractive. i played 60 hours and i can't stop."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"really liked, even the bugs make me laugh more of the game, just like witcher 3 came with funny bugs."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"after 4 days and 50 hours, after passing the two endings of the game, i can finally evaluate this game well. one word, liar. i have never experienced such a serious evil bug that makes my system need to be reinstalled. i have never experienced this kind of scam. every function mentioned in the promotional video is actually all in the game. there is no more content. you have watched the core system content of the entire game by watching the entire promotional video. starting from e3, this game is a complete scam, a liar. shameless liar."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i create an accound just because i am pissed of haters childish reviews i played so far around 50 hours at cyberpunk 2077. i went on walks, side missions and events to start discovering night city before diving into the heart of the matter, and i am under the spell, the least i can say is that i am not disappointed. we can recognize the quality of writing, narration and the setting up of the characters from cd projekt. sometimes a few regrets about the dialogue options, but nothing annoying. the music is awesome in the car, or the ost on a mission and sticks crazy and even knowing in general how the prologue would unfold, i am well on my seat, with a few surprises, and very close to entering the heart of the matter. i'm playing in hard mode for my first playtrhough, and the gunfights are intense. the gameplay mechanics i saw suit me, and compared to the 3 cd projekt previous rpgs has improved a lot. the whole artistic direction, graphics, carachter design, scenario, music, ambient noise, density and diversity off life city life is coherent and the immersive side is most successful... and it s far away the best city never seen in a video game. the contracts are nice ... but especially in the side missions that i have the most fun and some for a few hours ... there are little gems of atmospheres, writing and diversity. i don't know how many others side missions there are but suddenly the 25 or 30 hours for the main quest which seemed expeditious according to the critics, seem almost anecdotal given the richness of the rest of the game. i play on a pc that is almost 4 years old, in ultra without rtx of course has 2 or 3 details ready with average fps ranging from 38 to 46 depending on my gaming sessions. so far, just a few minor graphics bugs , nothing game breaking the role playing game i have been dreaming of having since the first trailer in 2013, with great immersion and a truly unique atmosphere sad to see such bad review from haters for the best game of the decade."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,great game so far the open world is amazing and the graphics are outstanding and story is very interesting cd projekt red have made literally a masterpiece
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"first off, i'm loving the story, and visually the game is stunning visually, literal eye candy if you've got the pc that can power it... for me, i think the biggest letdown is the amount of customisation and clothes  armour options... for a game set in a world where style and cool are the most important things, the fact there's only just over 70 distinct items of clothes for the player in the entire is just sad compared to some of the absolutely amazing outfits and designs you see on npc's around the world... character customisation is pathetically limited... i've seen free to play games that have more thought about the character put into it than this does sadly. the 'cyberwear' you get to chose in character creation is 14 transparent images that go over your face and basically act like tattoos. they could have done something truly amazing with cybernetic arms, legs, and really brought it to a whole new level... but it all got completely ignored and replaced with a 'cookie cutter' creation system that's not even as in depth as 90 of free to play mmorpg's out there online the storyline is great, the voice acting is amazing, and the design of the city and layout are truly something fresh and new... it's just the rpg side of it that is seriously being let down... treat it as a standard action  fps game with story and you're fine... if you're expecting an actual rpg like the game was advertised as, with customisation and a character you can truly make your own and grow with, you're going to be sadly disappointed."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"main story is a little short. but side quests are amazing. beside, have so many bugs in the game. so many that will make your playing experience become so bad. but i think cpr will fix it in the future"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"it's a step up from witcher 3 in my books, very glitchy but not unplayable. the story beats are solid and cdpr did a good job as always with those, the gameplay is just ok but not a total letdown."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"bug as hell yes, but the potential its crazy. you will feel inside the world like no other. avoid lastgen releases until half of the next year. pc its the way to go. if it is this good with bugs just imagine when its all patch up"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"para un juego esperado por casi 8 aos de una compaia que tanto nos dio antes, es decepcionante que halla llegado asi, pero lo mas inaudito, es el estado de misticismo que pusieron al dar las reseas, evitando imagenes y experimentar el juego en las consolas de sobremesa de la actual y pasada generacion, no es un juego que no tenga futuro, pero en este momento no parece un juego terminado, mas bien, una beta, multiples bugs, varias veces en que el juego deja de funcionar, imagenes parecidas a juegos de mas 15 aos de antiguedad, la promesa de que el juego funcione, tal vez, en febrero del 2021, es algo que aun es poco de fiar. por el momento es mejor no usar jugarlo en consolas, mejor esperar a ver si de verdad cumplen en el futuro, tal vez pase como no mans sky."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"terrifically ambitious and delivers. sure it's been a bit buggy on ps4 but this isn't fifa, it's a large and beautifully made world with so much going on that it's hard to quit playing. from small gigs to side missions and out to the main quest cyberpunk 2077 is an engrossing experience full of fleshed out characters! can not recommend this have enough."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,this would be a 10 in my book if it wasn't for the performance and bugs. this is the most immersive ingame world i have witnessed and gameplay is tight. cdpr will improve it and in a few years this will be remembered as a cult classic.

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"so i have a pc with a 3900x and a 5700xt with 32gbs of ram as well. i can run the game at high everything at 1440p and get 91fps on average since the hotfix. it needs some optimization for sure. it looks great and runs pretty well on my pc. i built this pc with this game in mind. the story is great so far i have about 14ish hours mostly side missions and some of the main story. day one only ran into a few visual bugs. after the hotfix, most of the bugs are gone for me but a new one has appeared. i will get a white flash from time to time. so i'm waiting for a new patch and playing ghost of tsushima till a new patch or hotfix. i do think the game needed more time, i also think they made a big mistake in how they handled the old consoles. but the game is good and will only get better after some patches. lots of games come out buggy. i also just bought ghosts of tsushimatoday 121420. that game has been out for a while now and i have run into more bugs in that game than cyberpunk 2077. but that is just my experience. it also doesn't take away from how good that game is. the story and gameplay are great. back to cyberpunk 2077, gunplay is kind of crap but really good for an openworld rpg. driving  even with a controller. it is a beautiful game to look at and be in the world. i look forward to what they are going to bring in the future. i'm buying it a second time on gog just so that the dev can get more money for the game at least if they are bringing dlc for free that is i will say for anyone that hasn't bought it. yes pc only, also wait for a few months unless your cool with playing the bug lottery. i haven't had a single gamebreaking bug, but i know people who have. if you are a big fan of the cyberpunk look and world the game is a great interpretation of it. i have to say that people really overhyped the game in a big way, both the company and the content creators. it is our job as consumers to temper those expectations and think about what we are really going to get. a game cant be everything unless you want another star citizen. a game stuck in development hell that may never come out because they want to be and do everything. so like i said if you want to gamble with how bad your bugs are get the game now. if you can wait then you should wait but please pick up the game in a few months. i love the game and i'm sure that the devs will take care of us. they have already proved that with that last hotfix, when the patches come out in jan and feb of 2021, i think the game will be running much better. i just wish they could have waited until then to release the game in the first place, even though i have been waiting since the first showed the game way back when. but some people the ones crying about it being bad would have been big babies about it'll never come out and all that crap."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game in general, but if you don't have a ps5, xbox series x or a 4000 dollar pc don't even try to play it. the optimization is ridiculous and unfinished, and even playing on a powerful hardware you will still experience hours and hours of bugs. i already lost 2 saves due to bugs. unplayable!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,don't let buthurt console gamers fool you this game is great but a little buggy
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"pros graphics sound story characters animations environment combat side quests cons driving needs some work, but could be fixed with patch regarding the bugs, i've noticed a few, but nothing game breaking that i've seen. i think rating a game based on bugs is odd, since most new releases have them, and they usually go away as the game gets patched. i guess i have been a pc gamer for so long that i expect this. i have enjoyed every minute of my time in cyberpunk 2077. there's so much to do. you could make taking criminals down in side quests a full time job without touching the rest of the game. the story and characters so far, are the really engaging. they make you feel connected to them, even though you may have just met them. the game has some amazing writing, which intertwines several different story arcs together in a seamless and interesting way that makes the player feel like they are walking in the shoes of someone in night city. graphics regarding performance, i have a very high end system with an rtx 3090, so i am seeing very solid performance, but have had to watch the digital foundry optimization video for some tips on how to get the best qualityperformance balance. i can say that this game looks truly remarkable when you get to the point where you have the qualityperformance balance. dlss is so helpful! sound is great! i like all of the radio station selections. sound effects are solid, and voice acting is amazing. so much dialogue in this game, it's insane. story i have played a lot of games, and this one has a story that reminds me why it's awesome to be a gamer. there are so many options on what direction to take in the game, and each on seems to be crafted with love and extreme detailing and knowledge of the genre. just fantastic!!! characters the main character, v, is a really cool character that really pulls off the role well. the npcs that you interact with throughout the game are all really engaging and believable. very well done here. environment each area in the game is so detailed, and i think the fact that they were able to have so many npcs walking around and cars driving about makes this feel like a much more realistic place, especially since the population in the future is only going to make things more crowded and messy. i like all of the attention to detail here. there's little tidbits of history strewn throughout the game in the way of conversations, downloads from data sticks found throughout the world, and other media. night city and the surrounding areas really come to life here. combat is pretty good here. there's a lot to it. guns are punchy, and the dismemberment is a nice touch."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,i'm giving it a zero just because fanboys are spamming baseless 1010 reviews. biggest anticlimax in gaming history. lucky i wasn't waiting 8 years for this bugfest. ai is braindead driving  enemies are bullet sponges for the sake of creating an illusion you're playing an rpg feels lifeless

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"ignoring all of the technical issues and just rating the game i think i'd give it a 610. one of the key things i try to factor in when judging a game is when it came out and what it does to push gaming forward. this game brings absolutely nothing new, and doesn't even live up to other games that came before it."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"it's abvious tha the game is not ready, but there a lot of parts that you can see how beathifull and imesive the game will be when if it will be ready . a lot of hate because the game runs much bater in pc than in consoles."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"the writing and cutscenes are decent. the city itself is large and fun to take in. you don't get to play your own character. you can physically change how they look, with limited presets, but that's it. the story is scripted and takes you down a path with a predetermined destiny. you may change your responses, but in the end it doesn't make a huge difference. your romance options are limited. your onenightstands? even worse. want to get another tat or change your hairstyle ingame? not an option. want to enjoy a drink at the bar, grab a coffee at a shop, or buy a hotdog from a stand? not an option. what people don't tell you is that once you leave the scripted bounds of the main story and some side missions, the world is not immersive. it isn't the nextgen in open world adventure that cdpr sold it as. they even changed it from rpg to actionadventure on their social media. npc ai is horrendous. stop your car in the middle of the road and the ai will just sit there. they don't get angry, they don't honk, they don't try to drive around you. cyberpunk 2077 will feature over 1,000 npcs that have their own handmade routines is simply not true. the video proof people have out there says it all. you have limited interaction with them, and they do minimal reaction to events around them. police? even worse. when you commit a crime, they don't come from nearby to try and find you, they spawn either right on top of you, or behind you, even if there was no place for them to have come from. it is horrible. hop in a car and drive away because they can't drive after you! while there are some things that you can certainly enjoy out of the game, the bad simply outweigh the good and i cannot recommend this game. i would also suggest you not buy it from steam as they are not consumerfriendly with their refund policy, despite the welldocumented technical issues with this game, not to mention they delivered something different than what had been advertised."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i've found it really hard to find a customer review from someone who hasn't welded their selfworth to the review score of this product, so i'm here to try and fill that gap and give the same 19 people who seem to be downvoting every critique something to do with their time. first, let's be clear  as a product, cyberpunk 2077 is in no way mechanically 'groundbreaking'. from toptobottom, the systems, setting, and gameplay are all wellworn within the rpg and fps genres. driving, shooting, stealth, crafting, weapon 's all been done before, and in many cases it's been done better. the game doesn't even adapt its source material particularly well  the original game was a critique of capitalism, oppression, racism, and corporate domination, this one is translated by a company that has openly placed itself on the wrong side of several of those issues in its recent history. it shouldn't be a surprise that their interpretation of such a property eliminates the subtext, nuance, and meaningfulness in favour of simple and staid mechanical tropes in an edgy neon slum world. what i'm saying is that game is not the second coming of christ. not even close. at least the witcher 3 was an example of existing trends polished to their apex. it is a high water mark of its genre. bugs, glitches, and outright broken versions aside, cyberpunk 2077 is not a paragon of anything. it's features are, in many instances, a lesser version of long established features in other releases. it looks good, in certain instances. but the most impressive visual moments will tank the performance of hardware even 1 year old, and you simply will not be able to run it at acceptable framerates without some kind of resolution downscaling on most systems. in a lot of other instances, the lighting and shadowing is buggy, the textures are muddy at various distances from the aforementioned downscaling, and the character animations are often janky, making an expensive and meticulously designed world that largely cannot be interacted with feel that bit more fake. and, as always, it's on these small details that the immersion rests. so it's almost funny that cdpr spent so much money and went to so much effort trying to make the game melt your pc when that effort is frequently undone by a character whose neck bends the wrong way while he's talking to you. the world is big and pretty, but its filled with bulletsponge enemies that just stand there and trade fire, shops you can't buy from, and npcs that flee screaming in terror when you knock over a garbage bin. the story is almost incomprehensible, and the dialogue is edgy technobabble that far too frequently loses the point of what its trying to say as the weight of all the characters' manufactured quirks pile down on top of it. the hud is overcrowded and will hurl text and video at you that is hard to concentrate on with how busy and bustling the environment around you is. and this is kind of the way the whole game goes. there isn't really a system, visual, or gameplay element that isn't either flawed, derivative, or just not as gamechanging as you were expecting. and obviously those expectations were absurd in the first place, but sadly the poisonous community of people who have inexplicably tied their own sense of self and wellbeing to the critical opinion of an entertainment product made by a company they're in noway associated with have made it near impossible to find a reaction that isn't saturated with some kind of anger at either the developers for swindling them, or the audience for daring to speak about their experience. at the end of the day, it's just a video game. a bombastic, costly piece of entertainment software, who's reach exceeds it's grasp. maybe, one day, it might be greater than the sum of its parts, but given the rushed state it released in, the fact that the company spokespeople lied about the game's quality and embargoed reviews so consumers wouldn't find out, crunched it's employees for a release date the game wasn't even ready for, and generally conducted themselves duplicitously and arrogantly, will they ever really deserve to be congratulated? not for this product. once again there exists a precedent for games that released in a worse state and will likely end up in a better one than this, and cyberpunk 2077 will be remembered as a product with lofty ambitions but little innovation."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,the game is literally breathtaking and i'm sure with time it will get even better!
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"whoever tries to defend this trash company, might as well give up gaming and find new hobby. scammers and liars like cdprojectred are not needed. they had 8 years to make cyberbug2077 perfect and they still failed. not only bug by the way, this whole game is most generic open world i have ever played. i understand when some company has like 23 years to make a game and there are some bugs. that's understandable. but cyberpunk 2077 was promoted as next generation of open worlds and they had 8 years to do it. absolutely no excuses work for this."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"the game is simply amazing. visually one of the best i have ever seen. the story so far is very good, the main and side mission are awsome, the leveling up progress is complex and unique. a great expereince overall. there are a few bugs and glitches but they are insignifficant to what excitment the game has to offer."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"the world is cool, the depth of it is nice, the npcs however make it shallow and dead. combat, other than quickhacking, is boring. enemies are bulletsponges, and the cover system is an utter joke. the story is pretty good, though predictable at stages. for 90aud, this game is completely not worth it. the npcs do not even hold up to gtav, a game released 7 years ago. the combat, which is the biggest part of the game, gets really boring. which , because after 8 years of development, one would expect the game to be pretty fantastic. however, cdpr have failed to meet expectations. , but the fanbase also makes this horrible. any negative comments on the game can get shut out by a fanboy army stating you're wrong. what can ya do."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"i played cp2077 since launch on pc, ps5, xbox series x, ps4 pro, and ps4 original. cp2077 is amazing, but, amount of the glitches, bugs, and crashes that i am encountering is way too much. however, i can look past the glitches and bugs graphical most of them due to the superb character building and story line of the game. however, on some consoles, its basically almost not playable on the ps4 pro and especially not on the original ps4 due to the frame drops and texture issues  even with the quick fixes. on the ps5, it runs great, but game crashes everytime you ride a motorvehicle in dense areas of the game and saving constantly is recommended. it still is a great game, but waiting on the game to be truly optimized before i can bump up the rating. consumers should have to deal with a broken game like this and this is bad tactics being done by the cdpr executives and shareholders. developers, you did your best, kudos, and i hope you have a welldeserved break."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"after finishing the game and playing enough hours, i can say that it's not what i expected, i didn't want to hype myself the last 3 years as i didn't want have too high expectations but still it made me feel disappointed. i'm not even going to talk about how buggy this game is and the bad performance it has, i wish those were the only issues this game has. the ai is as bad as mafia iii if not worse, if you put your bike on the side of the road with enough space for the cars to keep driving they just don't know what to do and stay still, same thing when you shoot, instead of go fast and escape, all of them get out of the vehicle at the same time and lay down like a 2006 game. the police is awful as the always respawn close to you and on your back no matter where you are, either on the middle of the street, a rooftop or a small room and when it comes to shootings they just go running or move without a clear reason, same thing with your teammates if there's any. the city is beautiful but at the same time completely empty as there's nothing you can do apart from main and side quests you can't even change your hair so the only thing you have left is go drving around nightcity while trying to complain about how bad the driving on this game is, the wheel turns way too much forcing you to drift and bikes are even worse, there's no way you can fall from it, no matter how fast you go, the crash or how many things you try to climb because it's physics are pretty bad. the backstory is pretty much meaningless like every choice you make in the game apart from the last mission and possible romances. the graphics are pretty good and i enjoyed the story but it's far from the things promised. you barely interact with each gang apart from 12 quests with each one, can't customize guns nor cars and because of the loot system it's completely wortless to buy something from a gun shop or a common shop to buy clothes as those are way too expensive and you'll end up looting something better in the next 12 hours. the only positive aspects of the game are the graphics, city itself buildings and neighborhoods and story. there's too many bad things from this game for me to say and again, i was tryng not to be hyped for this game because it looked so damned good and didn't want to be disappointed but it's just not good, it was all marketing"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"seems like most of the naysayers are trying to run this on 10 year old consoles laptops  i'm using a relatively dated 1080ti and everything looks pretty amazing. love the story, gameplay, and the scifi atmosphere vibe is truly incredible  haven't been this immersed in a game since the original mass effect... if you can't afford a decent pc right now, just come back when you're ready like how i waited years to play crysis or witcher 1  not a big deal. most of the bugs i've run into are hilarious little graphical glitches anyway that just gives this game an added layer of quirky charm  don't let them deter you from carrying on. just save  reload if it's a quest bug that fixes almost everything. 35hrs in and having a blast"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"one of my favourite games, amazing story, great visuals. 8 years was worth the wait, a must play!"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"awesome game, interesting story and amazing world, playing on google stadia"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"the narrative is good, the history catch u and introduce you to the world, then you find that the world is absolutely broken, secondary missions bugged and it disappoints you to the point that the main story doesn't matter and u hate finding a bug every 10 seconds."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"guys dont waste ur money on this overhyped game!!such a waste  they promised so much and they deliver nothing,the game it becomes so boring and  this really the next gen of games s hope not!!!"

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"one of the best games in the while history, anyone who thinks different is an ignorant"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"what can i say? one of the best games i've ever played. the story just kept me on playing for long hours. the game has few let downs  graphic bugs, mechanics could be better and the optimisation is not there  but i have good enough pc to play it on almost ultra with ray tracing and no fps drops. other than that i'm enjoying it very much. story is told in such a way that it feels like you play in a scifi movie at some points. if you're looking for a game that has a great vibe  this is the one."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"cyberpunk 2077 es un juego increble, a falta de pulido en consolas, jugando en pc y ps4 fat se nota la diferencia pero para nada la versin de consolas se merece una soga al cuello, muy disfrutable a pesar de los fallos en resolucin y framerate, ultra enganchado a night city"
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"810 in its current release state  will be 1010 once patched and with dlc. played on 2080s and i9900k  relatively stable performance though get pretty bad dips with ultra rtx settings, but otherwise fairly stable. only bugs so far have been minor visual ones such as npcs clipping through the map. played about 30 hours, mostly side missions. one of the most immersive open worlds i've ever played underlined with good quality writing, soundtrack, and enjoyable combat. driving feels a bit undercooked, but i would hope that can be addressed in future updates. enemy ai is probably the most disappointing element, but it feels like that can be improved a lot with inevitable patching. cdpr have definitely got something special here and it's a shame they had to push it out with so little polish  because despite that it is a fun ride on a decent pc."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"so many bugs... many... not some or a few... a looot of bugs in a 9 years developed game. i don't need to say more, just watch videos in youtube and see the reality of this game."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"disaster, no words can describe my disappointment. i really tried to like this game, but simply cant."

RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"deep, immersive, super quality this is mastetpiece with a true rpg mechanics amazing beautiful."
RPG,Cyberpunk 2077,2020-12-14,"main story is worth it all, 10 out of 10 in that regard. there are many bugs and some side quests minssion are repetetive but it's still worth your every penny just for the sake of the campaign and its visuals and music."
