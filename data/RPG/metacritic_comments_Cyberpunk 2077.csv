oknotokk,2025-02-19,50,"> 4.6 Between Bad and Avarage, They built their marketing strategies on the idea of that this game was a true RPG, but when it was released, not only was it not an RPG, it was also broken to the point of being unplayable. Moreover, the game itself wasn’t that good, and V is a very boring person."
Santypola11,2025-02-25,100,Es un juego con muy buena historia con una caracterización que te mete profundamente en el juego como ami con unos gráficos muy buenos.
vgallas,2025-02-24,80,"Tirando os bugs de desempenho e de gameplay,o jogo é ótimo.. história muito boa, gameplay ótima de se jogar."
Fourth_Jhana,2025-02-22,0,"I actually love this game. I'm having a blast playing on my PS5 (base PS5, v2.21). So why the bad review? Duplicate NPCs bug on PC (v2.1). While I hardly ever see dupe NPCs on my PS5 (in 15 hours of play time I've seen them 3-4 times, and a couple of those were _looking_ for them), on PC I was seeing them constantly with ease, even triplets. I have a good PC (SSD, 4060 Ti GPU, etc.) so it's not a specs problem. I also monkeyed with a bunch of settings but the dupes show up even on Low graphics, etc. They are frequent enough to break immersion and spoil the game. It's a great game on PS5 but PC needs to fix the dupe NPCs bug (maybe version 2.3?)."
luiz781,2025-02-22,100,Joguei a versão de ps5. E meus amigos q jogo foda.Platinei dps de90h de game. E ai da vou jogar a dlc e tbm avalia. N tive nenhum bug ou problema. E q história foda. Um dos melhores q joguei.
MushyDigestive,2025-02-18,80,"I played this way back when it was broken and had bags of fun even then. Luckily it’s fixed now and still fun, story is good and it’s kinda funny seeing Keanu Reeves pop up constantly. Enjoyed thoroughly, side content is the best part but the main story is decent also."
Joqker1488,2025-02-18,40,"Played it for 12 hrs and i cant really push myself anymore. Extremely boring and plain open world with absolutely zero interesting quests and situations. One million garbage useless mechanics that distract player from already plain and boring 25 year old gameplay. Story is ok, but since there is no immerse in the game i couldnt really enjoy it. Most main story characters are caricature and formulaic. Would rather call this game Far Cry 2077. Bugs are still there lol"

Wihglah,2025-02-16,100,"Hands down the best game I ever played. I 100%ed it twice. Judy > Panam. Excellent main quest loads of easily accessible side quests. Could have used amore prominent guild system but, wasn't held back"
assiscmp,2025-02-11,80,"no momento no qual joguei, o jogo tinha uma historia perfeita , gameplay incrivel, porém pecava muito com bugs e mal otimização , e fala bug nisso, se não fosse por esse problema, sem duvidas o cyberpunk 2077 séria uma nota 10 facilmente , porém nas minhas avaliações, eu geralmente diminuo 2 pontos se o jogo obtiver bug ."
Kajav,2025-02-10,80,"Analizar un videojuego es muy subjetivo porque las impresiones que puedo tener yo como usuario no son las mismas que puede tener otra persona. Por eso hablar de un videojuego tan polémico como cyberpunk es por poco un dilema. Yo daré me mis impresiones personales. Lo bueno: - A nivel grafico creo que solo Red Dead Redemption 2 puede ser punto de comparación. Increíble. - Night City es la ciudad original mas hermosa creada en un mundo abierto. Y competencia directa de grandes ciudades de referencia como las presentadas en Assassin's Creed que aunque no compiten gráficamente no son referente por la sensación que transmitían al recorrer sus calles. - La historia es muy buena, con varios finales y buena narrativa.- Para los amantes de la ciencia ficción es lo que se busca.- El sistema de disparos es genial. - La música es futurista, incluso en las clásicas. Lo malo: - Jugándolo un año después y con todos los parches que han salido aun se consiguen varios bugs que son molestos. - La progresión de las misiones secundarias no es tan lograda, con las típicas llamadas de ir de aquí para allá, róbate esto o mata a aquel personaje. - No sientes una verdadera progresión de personaje, se siente mucho a ACO en este aspecto. Antiguo si se quiere.- Los combates cuerpo a cuerpo no están muy bien logrados."
pimentayy,2025-02-09,100,"Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best RPG experiences i've ever had in my life. I confess, i was very reticent about playing this, because of the rough launch and the disappointment that many players had over the game. But now that i played it, i can say for sure that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best RPG's ever made. CD Projekt Red manage somehow to raise the game from the state that it was, and fix it entirely, giving the players the best experience possible. The story is amazing. Not only the main part of it, but all the side quests and side stuff too. All the parts of the narrative are very well written and well structured. The main story however is the highest point of the game, pairing with the character development that really meant a lot to me. I can't say that there is one character that's not interesting or not appealing. All the people that cross with V are important in some way, for his progress and development throughout the course of the game. The quest design is peak entertainment. Every single main quest is very unique, with his own very original style. I can remember several quests and moments that blew my mind and left me ""breathtaked"" during my playthrough. The side stuff is very appealing too, because it rewards you as the player to do them. All the gigs, the side job's and so on. It is in fact rewarding for the player to ""lose time"" with them. On top of that, there are so many different ""job's"" inside these side quests, that it doesn't get repetitive. Talking about the world of Cyberpunk, Night City is just breathtaking. The city feels very alive because of the density of crowd on the streets, the different factions in the different districts, and many other elements that make you feel like you're really there, with V, exploring the city and all it's corners. The gameplay, to finish this mini review, is top notch. The gunplay is very enjoyable with each gun feeling very unique and fun to play with. The exploration feels really different from anything else, because of all the interiors and buildings. The hacking system is just amazing, much better than other games that are entirely focused on it, with many possibilities do to whatever you want, and approach every situation as you please."
Valid_narwhal77,2025-02-07,100,At first i was hesitant to purchase this game but after playing just the first few missions I was blown away. The side missions didn’t feel like filler like in lots of these new AAA games and the main story was just so intriguing. The gameplay also felt very smooth and the progression system didn’t feel sluggish. I only had a few problems with the game like the fluctuating frame rate. Overall a true masterpiece in this genre of media
Abdo38532,2025-02-06,0,The game to this day still misses most of what was promised in the trailers
Serhii2001,2025-02-06,100,"Cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time. Six months ago, I completed both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, earning the Platinum trophy, and I loved every second of it. Now, I find myself itching to dive back into the chaotic, neon-lit streets of Night City once again. I can’t wait for the sequel! The story struck a deep chord with me - it hasn’t let go even to this day. Lines from the game still echo in my mind, and I’ve grown attached to so many characters, all of whom are written and developed brilliantly. Even after 180 hours of gameplay, the combat never got old, and there are still countless ways to approach missions, develop my character, and experience the game differently. Lately, a lot of games feel soulless, failing to evoke any real emotions. But Cyberpunk 2077? It has heart. It has depth. And that’s why I cherish it so much. I know the game had a rough launch, plagued by technical issues, crashes, and an almost unplayable state on PlayStation. But I have immense respect for the developers for not abandoning it. Instead, they kept refining and improving it, turning it into something truly spectacular—and delivering an incredible expansion on top of that. Thank you, CD Projekt Red, for making this masterpiece."
Neelyry,2025-02-05,100,fantastic game. augmentations really give you a ton of options. the smart weapons are my favorite.
thezzboy,2025-02-04,80,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
KuriousJorj,2025-02-03,30,"Boring AF. Stuffed full of trivial minutia busywork, long-winded NPC blathering, with the occasional clunky combat spinkled in here and there. So glad I didn't pay for this overrated garbage."
emielpiola,2025-02-02,100,"I played this game in January 2025, and it's truly spectacular. Addicting gameplay, complete and diverse mechanics between being a cyber samurai, a shooter or a hacker, wonderful open world with great visuals and immersive cyberpunk futuristic **** narrative is amazing, and so are the characters. V is great (I played with male V) but Johnny Silverhand is just one of the, if not the most, greatest video games characters of all times. And I am not exaggerating when saying this is, in fact, Keanu Reaves best performance yet. And Panam... what to say about her... Simply the best romance in video games history, extremely relevant to V's arc, the plot in general and author of the best ending possible.Soundtrack is amazing. DLC is fantastic (Idris Elba as Solomon Reed and Songbird are spectacular)It's definitely a 10/10 game. I know it had a lot of issues when it launched, but now it's a perfect game. A jewell from CD Project Red that leaves me with a lote of hope and enthusiasm for The Witcher 4, The Witcher Remake and of course, Cyberpunk sequel."
TarquiF,2025-02-01,90,"Played the full version 2025. This was an awesome experience. Everything is fun, everything is well crafted and mechanics are really well implemented. RPG system was flawless. Story wise... there are some lose ends, but nothing too wrong, also there were some minor bugs related with physics but nothing out of the ones that make you laugh."
BumpkinSTABBY,2025-01-31,100,"this game has so many bugs it made me question my own pc. but even with all the bugs and glitches, this is as good as it gets for open world games."
KirianBat,2025-01-28,60,Decent game. Graphics have its highlights but especially the NPCs look and behave horrible. Gungame is just decent and the preset settings are just bad. Didn’t like the boss fights as they were just annoyingly long but not hard oder challenging…
NSWNSW,2025-01-28,80,"SO to keep it short and sweet. Bought the game in March of 2021, such a hot mess, uninstall within two days. Blur/digital pixels ahead to Decemeber 2024. YES, YES, more please. This is the game I wanted, it's great, fun game play, fun dialogs, indepth characters and more. It still has it's issues, but its at bare minimal and it's more to my taste and wants versus overall game play. Graphics are beautiful. In a way, it followed V time line, game was close to dying, but it found its life line. Save the day"
K7Sniper,2025-01-27,90,"Definitely one of the best revival stories in gaming. What started out as a glitched mess has turned into probably one of the best FPS RPGs out today. They legit fixed almost every technical issue the game had, and added some good content to the game. Worth **** if you haven't gotten it et."
MKULTR4,2025-01-27,80,"Very good visuals, the world/universe is very interesting and has so much potential for future projects. Unfortunately the base game even with all the updates (2.2) still feels like it was rushed and was half baked even more when compared to Phantom Liberty which feels like a different game."
S0lnyx,2025-01-25,100,"A gorgeous game with a well-developed universe that really draws you in. Cyberpunk is not just a game about killing and going on missions, it is a game about the importance of choice, about building relationships with other characters and thereby creating your own history of not just becoming legend of Night City, and also developing V's story and his future, lifepath. It is an honor for me that I was able to allow myself to touch such a masterpiece from an equally wonderful studio with an amazing game director. ""Would you rather live in peace as Mr. Nobody, die ripe, old and smelling slightly of urine? Or go down for all times in a blaze of glory, smelling near like posies, without seeing your thirtieth?"""
Erbzz,2025-01-25,100,They really turned this game around from the bad launch. Props to cdpr. It has become a favorite of mine. 10 out of 10
KawaiOmega69,2025-01-21,100,"This game is truly an Experience. I can't even use words how much I love that masterpiece. I may sound like a fanatic, but in my opinion literally everything is perfect about this game, story, mechanics, story telling, development, world building, every characters and building. This game has something inside that just makes me stay in Night City for long long hours. Every game I play I usually Abandon it after finishing main story or spending some time but in Cyberpunk 2077 I just want to stay there, I just want to play even for the 10th time and Experience this art once again."
bazukarecep,2025-01-21,90,Oyun hatalarından arındırılmış yapay zeka hareketleri ve rol yapma kısmı çok iyi olmasa da oyun çok güzel. Oyunun en iyi rol yapma kısmı sonda bulunuyor.
Nightscape_,2025-01-17,60,"Had to give 2077 a 6/10 due to it's lack of optimization - but the world and story is engaging. Worth a pirate, not a purchase. The bugs, glitches, and crashes made the game feel like a labor of greed rather than a labor of love. It's why I waited until 2025 to try the game as I heard how bad it was at launch. It is still a hot mess, but playable, just save often."
Harinka16,2025-01-16,100,"I created an account just to rate this incredible game, which has quickly become one of my all-time favorites. I came in with low expectations, but it has pleasantly surprised me in nearly every aspect. I absolutely love this game."
VincentValen,2025-01-15,90,"Horrible first year. I had pre ordered and decided to not get a refund no regrets. I just waited for it to be ready,. Cyberpunk turned out to be an amazing game, it just took time. Hopefully this is a lesson to all companies to not rush a product. Make sure it is ready. Cyberpunk is a top 15 game all time for me. It might be a top 10, somewhere in between. It's absolutely worth every dollar. There's a lot of great content, characters and stories. I hope they release another game!"
obrunu,2025-01-14,90,"1 - Simplesmente um dos melhores jogos que já joguei na minha vida, não em questão técnica, o jogo tem muitos problemas no PS5, porém em questão de gameplay, diversão, história e construção de mundo, é incrível, você tem diversas maneiras de jogar e de seguir sua história. 2 - Problemas que encontrei durante minha jogatina: tenho 150h no game e o jogo crashou diversas vezes, umas 5 no mínimo, tem alguns bugs também de veículos e NPCs entrando no chão, mas o jogo é tão divertido que não chegou a me incomodar sinceramente, mas os bugs estão lá mesmo que sejam poucos, são notáveis. 3 - A DLC Phantom Liberty é incrível, adiciona muita coisa ao jogo e você percebe o carinho que tiveram no desenvolvimento. Eu definitivamente recomendo o game, é uma experiência única"
vinnie024,2025-01-14,30,"The story is short and depressing, it didn't satisfy me at all. The gameplay gets boring after a while, and the feeling of impact is terrible. It built up so much expectation and failed to deliver on any of it. I played it in the beginning, and I let it go back then because it was full of bugs, but nothing has changed. The game is still trash, in my opinion. Its open world feels extremely lifeless, with just NPCs and cars that spawn for no reason."
lgan123,2025-01-13,100,"I'M CHIPPING IN, Cyberpunk is the future of gaming, this is the ultimate game I have been looking for my entire life. The Night City, The Storyline, THIS GAME IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE"
TheWarriorMan,2025-01-11,100,"I recognize that the game has numerous bugs and issues, but it remains a fantastic experience due to its solid mechanics and compelling story. I genuinely enjoyed playing it, and it's impressive that a game set in 2077 can be so engaging! However, I do take issue with the jokes made about our creator, Jesus Christ."
Porx11,2025-01-08,100,"Story, gameplay, graphics, atmosphere. Everything in this game is perfect, literally everything. This is a masterpiece!"
DasEichenlaub,2025-01-06,70,"Playing in 2025... Starting with the bad: Open world is small, since it seems like one can't really create an urban open world or modern open world that feels real, maybe don't try. Night city is tiny and there's no traffic jams. Glitches, hats don't work properly. Encountered one weird stretching glitch when a body was dismembered. They still need to proof read the text, I teach English to migrants and refugees and their writing is often more comprehensible than texts I have encountered in game. Guns, don't use them in your game if you don't know how they work. They put too much effort into making the guns gamey. Shoulda made the combat much more deadly instead of sending more bullet sponges at you. Guns, cyberwear, perks all involve too much incremental change and or differences between options. Vehicles handle ridiculously and defy physics. Makes me wonder if the devs even drive. You can't really defy or rage against the dystopia and even if you did there wouldn't be any consequences. I keep accidentally hurting civvies and the cops hardly care and when they do they quickly forget. The good Graphics Voice acting, characters, story and art. They really convey the horror of a multicultural degenerate anarchocapitalist hell with the gross ads and prostitution simulation. At the smaller scale the environments, individual building interiors, are well designed to allow for multiple play styles and feel more or less realistic besides too many indestructible windows. Conclusion"
Avseq01,2025-01-04,90,"One of the best of its kind. This game is very good at taking you from your chair to night city. very immersive, very cinematic, sometimes kinda boring but overall its an unforgettable experience"
Rubyrouselim,2025-01-02,80,"Based on 2024 latest patch,my whole playtrough 95%free of bugs,the futuristic city is cramped with small little detail everywhere,especially most indoor area have a very detailed futuristic/complicated led lights/design(too ambitious no wonder game launch was disastrous)Smooth/fun Gunplay,most of the main story heist/mission was really good/epic,overall game structure feels like playing Gta/witcher3 with wide variety of moderately fun sidequest"
basic12345,2024-12-31,80,Not as good as promised. The game was launched when it was not finished. The delelopers try since then to finish the game with patches but it still feels a little bit unfinished.
0235,2024-12-29,20,"I am not your ""Bro"", especially when the first time i try to launch the game nothing happens, the second time it plays an advert for The Witcher 4, and the 3rd time it tries to get me to download AMD software. 4th attempt at finally getting in it calls me their own made up slang version of ""bro"" on a legal document. One of the worst most **** launches in the past 5 years, and doing nothing to redeem themselves."

pixeru,2024-12-22,100,"Best game ever, I mainly loves the vibes. Besides that, characters and combat mechanics are 10/10 if not 9/10."
Kaczorro28,2024-12-21,100,"Best game ever, period. The graphics, actors, plot, it is just insane what this game is capable of."
DarkMadison,2024-12-21,100,"Absolute masterpiece with one of the best plots in videogames. Even thought the launch was a pure mess, the developers fixed many annoying issues. Visually stunning with engaging gameplay, top notch music, and memorable characters. Cant wait for the release of Witcher 4."
eblk,2024-11-09,50,"""A visually stunning RPG with deep lore, action-packed gameplay, and style!"""
callen55047,2024-12-17,60,"A perfect example of quantity over quality. The game is visually appealing, and tries to do so many different things. But the story telling and main character lines were so bad that its hard to find reasons to come back and play it. I played it with the path-tracing mode on PC and the developers deserve some serious recognition for what they accomplished! But this game took me over a year to finally finish. I found that I was desperately trying to skip every bit of dialog just to get back out and explore the world. But then the world didn't have very much charisma or charm, and was generally buggy. I would hit a barricade while driving (vehicle handling is aweful) and if I was within 10 feet of a police officer, they would freak out and attack me with full force. The experience of driving around the city ended up becoming annoying and frustrating. If you have a path-tracing capable PC, I would recommend picking it up on a sale and playing it to experience what truly incredible lighting looks like. But I don't recommend this game in any other form."
hellorty,2024-12-17,30,"One of the most boring games ever created. They put so much effort into the hype, and keep upgrading graphics, but in a nutshell, the game has extremely weak and outdated mechanics, even Fallout 3 still feels fresher than that. It's like a regular polish shooter with cheap cyberpunk skins and designs made by some scholars, despite all their hard work on improving Ray Tracing stuff, etc. I waited for it for years and pre-bought it, and simply couldn't believe how bad everything was when launched it first and tried to have fun for 10-15 hours, then gave it another try one year later and the game was still bad af but with better graphics. Feels like a complete scam."
