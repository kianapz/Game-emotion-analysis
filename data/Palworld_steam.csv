"if Nintendo are suing Pocketpair for actually making a quality game that improves on every aspect that pokemon cant with the same recycled unfinished trash

Then these devs have done something right and their game needs all the attention and money they can get",True,531,10
"Bought this solely to support their fight against Nintendo.

It's a decent game though, It's like ARK but actually fun combat and more in depth creatures.

"The start of this game is so good. I played together with a friend and had a blast the first 30 levels or so. But man does the pacing get ruined in mid game.
The fun I got from playing Palworld was mainly from exploring the world, finding and catching new pals and collecting collectibles. But when you enter mid game, which is around level 30 you can't progress by simply exploring anymore. You instead need to farm materials to craft necessary items and farm the same pals you've already caught to gain exp. And this loop of farming and running around can go on for hours.
Me and my friend changed the world settings (higher drops etc) to make it more bearable but even so the game was too boring for me to want to continue. And it's so frustrating because the beginning of the game was so much fun and I wish the developers would've designed the game progression to be like that through out the whole game.
There's more stuff I could criticize the game for but what's written above is the main complaint I have and what made me stop playing.",False,113,20
"It's good, not great. It's a monster party game, you run around and catch your monsters, etc. But you only have a party of five and there are always going to be utility slots taken up for your personal movement and the like. Each pal can only actively have three moves slotted in, too, and given it's all real time it runs on cool downs instead - which is horrible if your pal whiffs and now everyone is twiddling their thumbs. Part of this is covered up by some pals being mountable, so you can fight as them, and then you yourself can have a weapon and run around. Except just you shooting most things is a lot more consistent, DPS-wise, as you don't have a cooldown even if you do less damage, so at some point once you're established the game becomes flying in on a bird, shotgunning a deer in the face before throwing a legally distinct pokeball at them and flying off again. Which is entertaining, but also pretty much the entire gameplay loop so things start to get stale. And you kinda have to do it, too, as everything is level-gated in a surprisingly stifling way.

But! It's also a thirty dollar game, so it being good, not great, is perfectly fine. Pal with your buds. It has jank, but nothing show stopping.",True,11,3
"I have played this game since the release of early access, this is an amazing game. I had great experience with this game so far. Yes, it has issues, especially end game, but overall it has more pros than cons for this price range. So far devs addressed many game breaking issues and keep improving the base game while adding new content. I recommend everyone giving a try, it is more fun with friends if you can afford to host your own dedicated server. I don't like how public ones are handled though, I don't recommend them.

"This game get compared to Pokemon allot but in all honestly I would compare more to ARK. 
Personally I would choose to play this over ARK. ARK is more hard core and less buggy but this game is just more fun. 

Some people have a very big problem with some monsters taking inspiration from Pokemon, sometimes heavy inspiration. But I think its like saying Agumon and Charmander are too similar and Digimon is a rip off of Pokemon, which was said back in the day.

"TLDR; Its ark, but actually functional and fun.

"The game just doesn't hold up to the hype. It lacks unique gameplay, and the world is devoid of interesting or unique aspects.  The pals are sporadic and random throughout and not unique. There is no real story to the game. It is extremely unbalanced gameplay, some enemies die in 1 hit, others kill you before you can it with max gear. The building is just beyond terrible, unless you are fond of squares. As that is the only shape you can really make. The building is a poor import of Ark building. The game can be good, but just releasing ""skins"" to prepare for release with a cash shop doesn't make it good.  

1, Make the game unique like originally claimed.

"It's base building and combat with cutsey allies.  You are sure to get at least a week of so enjoyment out of it.  There are some mechanics that are annoying like the weight and temperature mechanics, but these don't detract much from the game.  The base building is satisfyingly rapid and strategic and there are a number of decorative options for people interested in that.  I will say for those hoping to do multiplayer, that the multiplayer is very basic.  You have to either give other players a code each time you start up, play on public servers, or run your own server.  Emotes are also almost nonexistent.   Still, I'm sure things will improve and you can still make it happen with your buddies!  I recommend to all strategy and fps fans!",True,1,0
"The animations are cute, and the gameplay loop is enjoyable.  They have game settings right from the start that let you minimize the grinding you have to do, which was a blessing, and you can change them any time you start up that save, which is even better.  I would not allow young children to play it, though.  Pokemon is cutesy and tee hee they just fainted.  Palworld takes rocket launchers to people and pals alike, and has a lot more adult content.  Nothing graphic, but the concepts behind some of this stuff aren't what I'd put in front of kids if you have any who might want to watch you play.

If you don't want to breed super powerful pals, you aren't going to be able to interact much with the higher end content/raid bosses, which is a negative for people who don't have time to actively sit there and breed 116 of the same pal to cram into the one they want to upgrade.

Overall I enjoy the game, but it IS in early access still, and there are a lot of bugs related to the pal AI.  They put out updates fairly regularly, but it is still annoying to have things spawn in odd places and slowly starve into insanity without you knowing,",True,1,0

"Even with the extreme amount of hype for this game, it still exceeds my expectations.
Realistically, this game is VERY upfront with how it works. You can buy it, try it, and if you don’t like the basic gameplay loop, you will not like the rest of the game.

[b]Main aspects[/b]
The world is huge.
The base building is complex and enjoyable.
The pals and you each fight on their own, but you can ride/control pals if you want.
The combat is extremely fun, and far doesn’t get old at all.
The AI is pretty terrible, but the game is still EA. Even if it didn’t get fixed, this wouldn’t be “that” bad that it’s a deal breaker (to me).
There are some minor bugs, but people get way too bent out of shape over them.
The exploration for the game is amazing. There are legitimate rewards that make you want to look in every nook and cranny. So far, this is probably my favorite part of the game. Also, Lifmunk Effigies are honestly so much fun to hunt for.

[b]Something else they got right.[/b]
It's like each decision they made, they thought to themselves, ""what would be most fun to play?""
This seems obvious, but other games usually lack this. For example, ARK's base creation takes TONS of resources, even just for walls. You then have to place the wall, then sit there hammering it. Building a simple house can take FOREVER. Palworld sees the good of this approach, and removes the monotony of it, so it’s cheap and immediate.
When you destroy something, it gives you ALL the resources back, so you can experiment with your base without feeling like you’re wasting resources.
When you build, the game accessing ALL inventory within the base to use as resources, so you don’t have to keep going back and forth between storage.
You can ride Pals very early on, and even fly very early on, rather than waiting the whole game for it.
There’s just a lot of things in the game where it really feels like the devs chosen enjoyment over other unimportant things like realism or grind. They just wanted to make a fun game, and they succeeded.

[b]The bad stuff[/b]
You’ll see people complaining about bugs… people do that all the time about everything. From my experience there are very few bugs. I have clipped under the ground on a few occasions, but I’ve been able to remedy it fairly easily. That said, I’ve turned off drops on death, not to make the game easier, but because I don’t want to lose everything just because of a terrain bug (this almost happened just a while ago). That said, gear actually isn’t that hard to make, so it’s not even that big of a deal.
I believe there might be some multiplayer bugs for servers, but I also see them trying to fix these in their news reports.
The game doesn’t really have any story or anything, which is kinda lame at times. It’s completely open, and the only thing to guide you are little quests in the top that are basically irrelevant and you could completely ignore. After a while all they are, are “go here and kill this thing”. They have cool looking anime characters that are full of potential, but they do absolutely nothing with them, lol. There’s no story, no character development at all, they don’t talk, there’s no story. That said, the game is going in such a good direction, that I actually don’t want them to waste valuable dev time expanding the story/character elements, but it would be nice.
The game doesn’t hold your hand at all, so sometimes you pretty much need to look stuff up online. For example, I’m really trying not to just follow online guides, so at the moment I have no idea where to get quartz in the world, except from this one boss battle. I really need quartz, and I’ve explored far and wide and can’t find it, so I’ll probably have to break down and Google it.
Pal rarity should be more interesting. It’s basically just location, and then day/night cycle. Nothing is actually “rare” in this sense, and you don’t feel like you need to hunt them. There should be an element of having to hunt, and find them, but that’s missing from the game. Perhaps I’m just being too picky here though.

[b]Is it a rip-off?[/b]
Note, this is not a rip-off of Pokémon. It is also not ""Pokémon with guns"". This is essentially a rip-off of ARK, with Pokémonish creatures instead of dinosaurs. If you didn't like ARK, you will not like this game.
Personally, I don't care if it's extremely similar to ARK. Basically every game that comes out is similar to something else; there's no way around this. Did they copy some Pokémon ideas? Almost certainly yes, however, there's like a thousand Pokémon, so it's kind of hard ""not"" to at this point (there's a literal bag of trash Pokémon after all).
The whole court case thing is actually a massive problem for the gaming industry. Regardless of what you think of Palworld stealing from Pokémon, if Nintendo proves that you can patent just about anything, and stop other developers from making enjoyable games, this will create a monopoly situation. This will hurt video game development for decades to come. Another good example of this is how Shadow or Mordor/War created the amazing nemesis system, but now NO ONE is ever allowed to ever have this in their game, with it being literally decades until people are allowed to again. This ruins creativity and possibilities for game devs. I understand wanting to protect your intellectual property, but we’ve gone way past that in this case. Game devs should be allowed to do what they want, use whatever ideas they want, to make the game they want to make (aside from just flat out stealing code).

[b]Should I buy?[/b]
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever. That said, it is an open world survival type game. If you don’t like that, then you won’t like this. This is not at all similar to the Pokémon games’ gameplay, so keep that in mind. There’s a lot of base building/management to do if you want to succeed. But, if you like that, then this is an absolute must have game.",True,1,0
"[h1]Palworld – Cute Pals, Questionable Ethics, and Total Mayhem[/h1]

""Palworld"" is like Pokémon took a detour through a dystopian survival game and came out with a serious case of dark humor. You collect adorable Pals, but things go off the rails fast when you realize those fluffy friends can be used for everything—from running your sweatshop to acting as your personal meat shield in battle. Oh, and anything inside a Pal Ball? Yeah, technically a ""Pal,"" even humans. Let the chaos begin. 😈🎯

[h2]Pros:[/h2]

Pals are adorable... until you start using them as mobile power plants or cannon fodder. 🐾🔫
A wild variety of gameplay: farming, fighting, factory work, or just casually shooting at your own Pals for fun. 🌾💼💥
Dark humor everywhere—like when you realize you can “accidentally” shoot a Pal (or a ""Pal"" that's suspiciously human) and still sleep at night. 🤷‍♂️😬
I’m having an absolute blast with all the chaos. It’s weird, wild, and totally addictive! 🎉🔥

[h2]Cons:[/h2]

Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of all the mayhem. Is that a farm or a battlefield? Who knows anymore. 😵‍💫


If you love cute creatures, dark humor, and the occasional ""oops, I just shot my Pal,"" then ""Palworld"" is the game for you. It’s not just about collecting Pals—it’s about seeing how far you can push the moral envelope while laughing at the absurdity. I’m having way too much fun with it. 😏💣",True,5,2

"Character Data Gone
So me and other people i play with have had our character data randomly be corrupted/deleted and the next time we log in we have to make a new character, all our stuff is gone, and basically start fresh",False,3,0
"Great Idea, Disappointing Execution
The concept behind Palworld is absolutely brilliant. It’s what many players have been wishing for: a blend of Pokémon, survival gameplay, and sandbox adventure. For players who aren’t too concerned about technical details and just want to enjoy the gameplay, I can still recommend this game. It has its moments and can be fun if you’re not looking too closely at its flaws.

However, as a software developer and hobbyist game designer with experience in UE5, I find it hard to overlook the many issues that hold this game back. These problems might not bother everyone, but from my perspective, they significantly detract from the overall experience.

I understand that my negative opinion might not be popular, I've never been a popular person anyway xD, but this is the perspective of someone who knows the tools and workflows of UE5. And from that standpoint, Palworld feels like a missed opportunity.
After spending considerable time with the game, here are the key issues I’ve noticed:

1. The AI: Broken and Frustrating
The AI in Palworld is poorly implemented. NPCs and Pals often run into obstacles, get stuck, or act illogically. The pathfinding feels almost non-existent, which repeatedly breaks immersion. This is particularly noticeable during combat, where enemies frequently get stuck against walls or fail to navigate properly. As a result, the battles feel clunky and unengaging, making them more frustrating than fun.
As someone with experience in AI development, I can confidently say this level of AI is unacceptable, especially when using modern tools like UE5.

2. The World: Generic and Empty
The game world feels lifeless and unfinished. Large, empty areas are filled with randomly scattered objects and items, while Pals roam aimlessly without any sense of purpose. With UE’s free assets (like Megascan), and the PCG Framework (Or Voxel), it would be possible to create a richer, more immersive world in just one day. Unfortunately, Palworld feels like it lacks the thoughtful design and detail needed to bring its world to life.

3. Animations: Clunky and Outdated
The animations are incredibly awkward. UE provides so many tools and features that can simplify and improve animation workflows, even for small teams. It’s baffling that a game built on this engine can deliver such unpolished animations. With proper budgeting and time, this could, and should, have been far better.

4. The Building System: Low Budget
The building system in Palworld feels incredibly low effort. It reminds me a lot of the Player Building System package available on the UE marketplace (https://www.fab.com/listings/c3806e8d-1903-47b3-97c2-378f279c399b), which was free for a time. While this package is functional, it’s clearly a template designed for prototyping rather than a polished feature for a full release.

5. Visual Style: Inconsistent and Disjointed
While graphics aren’t the most important aspect of a game, they do play a major role in immersion. In Palworld, the cartoony Pals and NPCs clash heavily with the semi realistic environment. On top of that, the Pals appear almost placeholder like with their low-poly style. A consistent low-poly aesthetic for the entire game might have worked better than this mismatched ""Frankenstein"" style. Additionally, the game’s LOD settings are strange and contribute further to the visual inconsistency.

6. Technology: Unreal Engine Not Fully Utilized
UE is one of the most powerful tools available to developers, offering countless features to make development easier and more efficient. Yet Palworld feels like a game that barely scratches the surface of what this engine can do. It comes across as unfinished, as though the developers either didn’t have enough time or didn’t fully leverage the tools at their disposal.

Final Thoughts: Great Potential, But Little Substance
I really wanted to like this game. The idea is fantastic, but the execution left me disappointed. I found myself constantly thinking, “This could have been done so much better!”.

I might even spend my next vacation creating a Palworld clone to demonstrate how some of these issues could be addressed. With the power of UE5, there’s no reason this game couldn’t have been much more polished.",False,8,0

This game goes far beyond any pokemon game in depth and complexity.  While there are clear rip offs from that franchise it is unique game in it's own right.  The game is geared for an older audience.  It is a bit grindy and just challenging enough to be frustrating at time.  The game will not lead you down a path.

"This game is fantastic, better than Ark survival and Pokemon.
Very possible to get 100%  of achievements.
Huge open map with a ton of creatures to capture and battle.
Crafting things does take quite a lot of time though.
Much more fun with friends too, though overseas friends will experience connection lag with push and pull.

Jetragon is great for fast a moving mount, Anubis is good for farming Palsouls.

"the love put into this game is incredibly apparent and shows what a monster catching game could be like. while i admit, a COUPLE of the designs of the initial release were uninspired and blatant copies of some pokemon, there are so many more unique and creative ones, or ones that take inspiration and uniquely improve upon the design (e.g orserk v garchomp, imo orserk is way cooler). With the latest sakurajima and especially feybreak updates, every pal in that got added is unique in design from any pokemon, and goes to show the creativity the devs have and the love for this game they are putting in. this all goes without mentioning all the fun gameplay things they add, ranging from things that casual players can enjoy such as exploration and finding new pals, to things that hardcore players can put hours and hours into.

Its like Ark survival but without the need to senselessly sink vast amounts of time into it.
It's also a bit like Pokemon/Digimon but with more robust gameplay systems in place.
A survival game where base building is fun and tasks can be automated utilising an army of Pal slaves.

"It's a really forgiving 'survival' game even at normal settings resources and progress have a steady pace up till you get to intermediate to advanced tech. Building bases could use a bit of improvement and more parts (like half walls,railings, etc.)  but it's a lot of fun for what doesn't need to be a huge time investment.

I had my first base feeling self sufficient in the first day of play, and now at 20 hours in I'm well into my second base building a completely unnecessary fortress(when I should be progressing) just because I have the resources to spare and I can. I expected it to take much longer to get to the point I could just build things for fun. Especially after having played games like ARK.

My only disappointment so far is the lack of interaction with the factions and characters in game. Even the boss battles are just intro scene and then you fight with no words or explanation whatsoever that's a bit weird to me.

TLDR: If you want a low stress 'survival' sandbox to fool around in this is a safe bet. Though if you're looking for plot or interesting characters to interact with this ain't it. Lore isn't that deep here.",True,0,0

"Only 7 hours in and I can't stop playing. It's 2.19 AM and I have blood tests to do at 9.00 AM lol. I haven't sunk into a game like this in a long time. I have to go to bed :P But I'm looking forward to jumping on tomorrow. 

I picked this game up for $32.96 AUD and it's worth every cent. Kudos to the developers, I'm not an easy person to please when it comes to video games. I'm loving the Penguin pal, I take him every where when I go to slaughter everything.

I'm sure I'll have some later feedback, like the timer on food that can be reset by just clicking the sort button. But that's trivial. I can handle small things like that. Other than that, the game runs really well. The game has Zelda vibes, but with building / tower defence / pokemon / minecraft / World of Warcraft. That's my take on it.

"This game has been everything I had hoped for! I'm determined to get this game to full completion in every way imaginable. The base building is fantastic I love the mechanics of building a base in this game with all of it's functions. One thing I find quite annoying is that if I log off and come back on the next day all of my pals at base are in critical condition with all sorts of sicknesses and low SAN, to solve this I just drop them on their own page in the pal box before I log out and take them all out every time I log in. The range of pals is pretty neat and I'm kinda sucked in to wanting to catch every single one of them. This game is so in depth with the pal perks and stats you really have the possibility to create your dream team pal arsenal! I love the game so much I went ahead and got 6 months server time for my own server I'm currently level 54 and still have SO much to learn about this game and that is a very good thing! This has been a game I want to play and play.. and play. :D. If you haven't picked up this game yet I'm telling you - you have NOTHING to loose! This game has been a 10/10 on a scale of enjoyment for me highly recommend!",True,0,0
First played on Xbox through gamepass Just bought it again on PC. A lot of new changes since I last played. Lot of cute and cool pals. My favorite thing about this game is that how grindy the game can be  is 100% up to how you play and you can even change it in the settings. Pal designs are great I wish they would come out with plushies. Really cozy survival game.,True,0,0

"This should be the new standard for an Early Access games. 

I don´t really have anything to complain about, it feels like a complete and very well made game.
Only pointers: 
- More pals
- Better technology tree (Or system) 
- Job priorities (Like in Rimworld) 
- Job commands for crafting stations (Like in Rimworld - ´Slaughter animal - Infinite´ - would be nice for spheres) 
- Make transport more powerful - double if not triple it´s effect.
- Make pals able to empty workcamps (Stone pit, Logging site etc.) 

It isn´t a fantastic co-op game since paldium is used for Pal spheres which can be quite the hastle for two people to share early in the game.

""대체 시벌 뭔 게임이야 이게...?"" 싶었었고

"No doubt like many others, I got this game basically just to point and laugh at the pokemon rip off. I could not have been more wrong about this game. This game is what pokemon should be. I have been hoping that pokemon would do something like this for over a decade. Legends Arceus being the closest thing. There are certainly some designs that are blatant rip offs of pokemon, but from what I have seen thus far, there are significantly fewer of those than I was lead to believe. As a survival game, this game is fantastic. It is incredibly immersive to live in tandem with the pals, working and fighting alongside them. Seeing them all walk around and exist in their respective habitats is fascinating. I am surprised that it took this long for something like this to come along. Fighting alongside your pals while dodging enemy attacks is incredibly engaging. The map is absolutely enormous and filled with interesting things to find, like chests, dungeons, upgrades, and most importantly, new pals. The progression is vast and it feels like each level up is actually meaningful in terms of tech for your base and weapons for taking on stronger enemies. My biggest complaints about the game revolve around bugs and general stability. I can often play without issue for extended periods, but when a bug does happen, it can be game breaking, like falling through the map, or pals being stuck in place and not being able to do anything. These bugs hopefully will be ironed out in due time. All that said, I am extremely excited to see where this game goes in the future. To anyone on the fence about picking this game up, or to anyone who still thinks this is a rip off of pokemon, I strongly urge you to give this game a try, I honestly wish I had given it a chance sooner.",True,0,0

"It's a very good monster collector/battler. As someone intimate with the genre, I couldn't be happier with the breeding system, and the various ways to improve pals (Skill fruit, Elixers, etc.).

Of course some pals will be better than others out of the box, but with some real dedication you can have a Lamball much more powerful than any Jetragon.

Usually I hate open world games but Palworld makes exploring very fun with various mounts and tech for getting around fast.

The game was super buggy on launch but the devs are really devoted to fixing the problems and adding real, tangible content. They've added new Pals here and there, new bosses, and even an entirely new area.

"Want  to start off saying This is what i always hoped Pocketpair Craftopia would have some day became. So if you enjoyed that game you should enjoy this.

I have about two hours in and within the first 40 minutes i already had my first 4 pals and the fun could begin. I from the bit seen the game is Single player friendly and for all my pet trainers out there i will give a bit of extra details. Pal gain XP while not on the play field. So you can have your battle pals and your mount pals and they won't lose out on xp being in their balls. You can DE spawn your Pal in less then a second including mid attack so you don't have to worry about your pal randomly KO the guy your currently trying to capture.

As to game play well it's fine to good. I'm not deep enough to see if melee improves and as this is a shooter not much reason to expect much from the hand to hand. I will say that past the first three default Pals you can die. This game is not making the starting zone your play ground like in other games. the early Pals can kill you with five or six hits so be careful.

On a side note i can see why Nintendo had to knock the game down a peg with legal non sense. This game could honestly give Pokemon a run for the money. Battling with the Pals and their limiter move set has been what must Pokemon fan have wanted for generations. Honestly watching my pink cat Pal fighting a sheep pal without me made me think of early Pokemon anime. Sadly for Pal command you just have, don't attack, attack what i attack, and attack everything that moves. The clothing/armor has it's charm and the weapon's do have that fantasy scifi look and feel. If not for Nintendo i think this game would be in a even better place. 

Still in the end the game has had a number of massive updates so Pocket pair seemed to put a lot of the money from the OG popularity back into the game and it has honestly from the start looking and playing well and it worth getting Full price to help stick it to Nintendo but with all Early Access Games worth getting on a good sale because it's impossible to know where/what state the game will be when Pocket pair takes the Early Access Game training wheels off.",True,0,0

I am so incredibly impressed with how much they've been able to accomplish with this game in such a short amount of time and just seeing their constant updates on what they'll be adding next always excites me. This game is seriously everything that Pokemon should have been to begin with. There are occasionally minor bugs or mechanics that can get annoying but none of it has been a very big deal for me so far. Overall I am very happy that I purchased this game. My boyfriend and I played this game together when it first came out and completely finished it before they released more updates. Since then they've added way more so we started a new world and have been having so much fun with all the new things that they have added to the game. Definitely worth a shot! :),True,0,0

"Palworld is a fever dream of a game. It throws adorable monster-catching mechanics into a world of dark humor, automation, and survival chaos. It’s quirky, unsettling, and somehow still charming.

[h2]The Great[/h2]
[list]
[*]The monster designs are obviously Pokémon-inspired but bring enough charm to stand on their own. They’re oddly cute despite the madness around them.
[*]The audacity of tackling themes like forced labor and even cannibalism. It’s dark, but it’s so over-the-top it feels like the game is in on the joke.
[*]The world is bright and colorful, making every corner feel like it’s bursting with personality. You can’t help but want to explore.
[/list]

[h2]The Not so Great?[/h2]
[list]
[*]The idea of enslaving or arming monsters is funny at first but gets uncomfortable quickly. The message is murky and feels hard to digest.
[*]Repetition kicks in too fast. Once the novelty wears off, the gameplay can feel like you’re going through the motions.
[*]Playing solo feels empty—like the world is big but missing life. It reminds me of survival games where you notice the loneliness when no one else is around.

Palworld doesn’t always hit the mark, but it’s impossible to deny how bold and unique it is. If you’re in the mood for something unapologetically weird and chaotic, give it a shot.",True,0,2
"Palworld is a game that Pokemon could only hope to be while Nintendo only keeping their game on an under performing platform.  The only real criticism of the games similarities can only go as far as what is already included in other games and giving millions of people what they have wanted from Pokemon games before, meaning inspired by which is not illegal.  Any cartoon like monsters are going to take on similar features and many games have already done this, even the capture system is similar to concepts before Pokemon even existed, just Pokemon is the most popular.  As far as the game goes it is great, has improved constantly, offered excellent battles and capture process, and has consistently patched any issues I've ran into since first playing when it came out.",True,0,0

"An implausibly good mashup of different gaming elements--from obvious inspirations like Pokemon to bits of Breath of the Wild, Minecraft, and third-person shooters. This game is everything I hoped it would be, even in early access. Can't wait to see what full release looks like.
And now for my very, very specific hangup on Pal World's competition, the thing which really makes the game stand out for me. You see, despite how good the game-play itself feels, my favorite aspect of Pal World actually lies in the monster design, which, far from being mere knock-offs of Pokemon, match or often exceed the early designs from Gen 1 - 4 of Game Freak's long-running franchise. Personally, I'm tired of collecting dumb-looking monsters as Game Freak keeps trying to reinvent its design philosophy. Give me an edgy fire lizard or a floofy mound of poof. Stop with overly complex designs that no longer resemble anything in nature.
Anyway, please give the game a try. Unlike Game Freak, this development team has no laurels to rest on, and they are actively trying to earn goodwill from the community. Give them a chance, and you won't regret it.",True,0,0

Solid adventure survival and monster taming mechanics. Everything you expect from a typical craft/build/survival genre and a monster tamer game put together. It has a lot of fun abilities and items. The mechanics are fairly self explanatory if you are a gamer but if you are new to gaming it could use a little bit more hand-holding. As it is in early access there is frequent updates and content being added. Even if it were to be officially released at this stage it is a fairly full game with lots of things to do. I will probably end up putting way more time in it.,True,0,0

It's just...new. Arguably one of the most complete early access game's I've ever played, this game is a great combination of survival and basebuilding, combined with monster hunting and open-world exploration. Plenty of content for the casual player, already very difficult end-game, and good pacing on default settings (even though there are significant customization options supported natively, not to menion mods).

Great game to grind, great game to play casual. KBM or controller, extremely fun either way. Great game.

its pretty good and i like the annoying CELLECT WOOD OVER AND OVER alot more than other games because of pals are cool i would like it more if you could have all 5 pals out at the same time but balancing would have to be overhauled. its hard in my oppinion but when i watch other ppl play they just start in the starting area and build a base and get super level but the balancing is very good if you dont no life it,True,0,0

"Charming and addictive~

Incorporates the base building and resource grinding/crafting of ark, with the monster catching/breeding/training of pokemon. Don't play this expecting a perfectly polished experience - it's pretty scuffed, but less in a gamebreaking way and more in a funny kind of way.

"Palworld is an ambitious endeavor of a game.  Combining elements of ""legally distinct gaming"" that we've never seen before with survival and open world mechanics, this game was enjoyable.  However, it is held back by being in perpetual beta.  It doesn't feel like a fully fleshed out game, and some of the multiplayer mechanics are lacking.  If you're looking for a multiplayer daily driver to play with your friends, you'll need to purchase a server.

PROS:
1.  Lots of monsters to collect and use in your customizable base/home.
2.  Interesting art style and graphics.
3.  Survival-type progression feels very rewarding.

CONS:
1.  The story mode is the progressing of the game - so as to say that the rewards are the friends and fun you have along the way.

Forget about the whole pokemon thing and look at it like this. This is a game where you can effectively take on the whole world with slavery and friendship.

No 'we must live in harmony and stop the bad guys', no 'save the world and become its champion.' Just have fun making the world yours.

"Palworld is a super charming Survival-Crafter/Monster-Catcher, the Devs consistently take player feedback on board when adding or changing features, and though it still has some early-access jank I can't really sing it's praises loud enough.

There's currently a fairly expansive list of 140 different Pals, and a good chunk of those also have variants that have a different type, ability, work suitability, and model. The vast majority of the Pal designs are great, plenty of really unique looks that have so much character to them.

The tech-tree is very similar to Ark, if I recall correctly. You get points to spend when you level up or discover fast travel points, and a new tier of tech to unlock with each level up as well. There's also a separate tech resource that you get from defeating bosses located around the map, which lets you unlock more unique technologies such as the Feeding Bag or the Incubator.

Exploring the map is satisfying, and the world has some really beautiful spots to admire or build bases at. The player by themselves can run, jump, swim, and climb using stamina that you can increase as you level. Early on you unlock a glider that has multiple upgrades that increase the speed and reduce the stamina drain of using the glider. Then you also have Pals that can aid in exploration as well. Some Pals can be mounted and excel in either Land, Air, or Water movement, while a small number of pals can act as replacement gliders with their own unique functions like Hangyu which lifts up rather than having any sort of drop-off.

Combat and Catching pals is fun, if a little simplistic, the Player gets a variety of different melee and ranged weapons ranging from clubs and spears to bows and later on guns. You can carry around a team of 5 Pals and can have 1 active to help you fight at any time, and you can control the Pal directly if they able to be mounted. Almost every Pal can be captured, including most Bosses which will retain their increased stats and size after being caught as they are marked as ""Alpha"" Pals.

There's loads of different random events that spawn around the map as you travel, which makes the open world feel a lot more alive when you're running around, and there's lots of different bosses dotted around the map that usually make for fairly engaging fights. You can also find Dungeons which contain special loot and always have a random boss Pal at the end.

The game also features a variety of Story-based Boss fights that all have their own unique boss lead by a Pal Tamer, they all start with a really neat intro cutscene that adds a lot of character to them without any need for dialogue. These boss fights are very tough and you really need to be prepared with good gear and at least a Pal or two that work well against the enemy. Another special kind of Boss is a Raid Boss that you can summon, which as the name suggests is a massively big and powerful Pal that has lots of unique attacks and mechanics. These fights are timed and they are doable in single player, but you can fight them with an entire bases worth of Pals which makes for some really epic scenes.

Overall the game is really well made, and you can tell the Devs have put a lot of love and work into it. Despite being early access you can get hundreds of hours of great fun out of it, and the Devs are constantly improving based on player feedback so it's super easy to recommend.",True,0,0

"This game is really fun and definitely worth the price especially if you get it on sale. Currently, I’m at a level 60 and 90+ hours in the game. Obviously, I’ve really enjoyed it and I can’t wait to see the new content that comes out!  

Pros:
    • The pals are really funny and are so creatively made. I love finding new pals but my favorite will always be Ribunny because they are so cute 
    • The game has a good balance between crafting and exploring
    • The map is so beautiful like I actually love exploring and seeing all the different seasons and habitats
    • I’ve played 90 hours and I still haven’t explored the whole map. I could easily get to 130 hours which would put the game at $0.23 per hour with the game’s current price of $30. Totally worth it to me

Cons:
    • This game is still in production so there are glitches like random pals that float and enemies that glitch through the map. It wasn’t bad enough to stop my gameplay, but it’s enough that I’m putting it in the cons list.
    • Certain things seem unbalanced like a boss needs to be nerfed or why do I need so much freaking paldium for crafting. Hopefully this will get patched though!

Pros: Exploration, discovery, and experimentation are very rewarding and enjoyable. Consistent updates have added new content and the quality has remained consistent.

Cons: The endgame of palworld is poor generally, and borderline unplayable for solo players. The health of tower bosses, oil rig enemies, and raid bosses has no scaling based on player number. Pals don't function properly on the oil rigs. Content is consistently added, but none of these systems have been improved since release.",True,0,0

I also find moving stuff into chests really inconvienient, I really wish there was a quick stack option to move everything from my invetory into the stacks in the chest. Only other thing would be that I would like more NPCs that have more uses, because it feels a bit lonely in the game. I feel like making the villages more lively would help, like adding pal residents that dont have a capture incentive, NPCs that would want to trade with you, decorations, ect. I love that you can slide down hills, I just wish there was an AI improvement and graphics improvement in some areas of the map. Can't wait to be able to visit that giant tree in the distance, flew all the way over to it only to be met with an invisible wall, I wanna see whats in store for the future. Definitely going to need more customization options though, and there is a glitch where my mouse disappears until i click another button in the character customization.

"Title: Palworld: A Dichotomy of Gaming - The Best and Worst Aspects Explored

Introduction:

Palworld, an upcoming game from Pocketpair, has stirred a significant amount of excitement and controversy within the gaming community. Promising a unique blend of creature collecting, survival mechanics, and sandbox gameplay, Palworld has captured the attention of gamers worldwide. However, beneath the surface lies a polarizing array of features that make it both the best and worst game in the eyes of many players. In this essay, we will delve into the various aspects of Palworld, examining why it stands out as a groundbreaking title while also acknowledging the criticisms it has faced.

The Best Aspects of Palworld:

Innovation in Creature Collecting:
Palworld introduces a fresh take on the creature collecting genre, combining elements of traditional monster-catching games with the survival mechanics of popular titles like Minecraft. Players are tasked with capturing and raising creatures known as ""Pals,"" which can be utilized for various purposes, including farming, construction, and combat. The depth of customization and the ability to train Pals to perform specific tasks adds a layer of strategic depth not typically seen in similar games.

Dynamic Sandbox Gameplay:
One of Palworld's most appealing features is its dynamic sandbox environment, which encourages player creativity and experimentation. From building elaborate structures to designing intricate traps for enemy creatures, the possibilities are virtually endless. The game's open-ended nature allows players to carve out their own unique experiences, whether they prefer peaceful farming or action-packed battles.

Multiplayer Interaction:
Palworld offers robust multiplayer functionality, allowing players to collaborate with friends or compete against each other in various activities. Whether it's teaming up to tackle challenging dungeons or engaging in friendly competitions to see who can build the most impressive base, the multiplayer aspect adds an extra layer of depth and replayability to the game.

Stunning Visuals and Art Style:
Visually, Palworld is a stunning game, with vibrant colors, detailed character models, and lush environments that draw players into its immersive world. The game's charming art style adds to its appeal, making it visually distinct from other titles in the genre. From the adorable designs of the Pals to the expansive landscapes teeming with life, Palworld is a feast for the eyes.",True,0,0
"Its what pokemon games could be, if Nintendo wasnt so lazy at making games and too busy making fan fictions about Typhlosion.",True,0,0
"What you get if you take a pared-back version of Satisfactory, Pokemon, and Breath of the Wild and mash them together. A pretty fun early game based on roaming, exploring, discovering, and capturing, that grinds to a painful halt in the late-game as it becomes a resource management and crafting sim without even the most basic features of a game like that. I had fun, but I don't think I'll pick this up again.",True,0,0
"It can get addicting with all the layers the game has to offer. Building up your Base, farming, mining, bosses, raids, and having such a huge world to just roam around and explore make it very enjoyable and so much time will literally pass in the blink of an eye.",True,0,0
"Palworld is surprisingly really good, 9/10. It manages to blend in so many different gameplay elements from all kinds of games and a bunch of different genres into a cohesive, and most importantly fun experience.

If you like Ark: Survival Evolved + Pokemon + Genshin + Fortnite + Elden Ring + Slime Rancher + Satisfactory + Astroneer, you would also enjoy this game as well.",True,0,0
"I rlly love this game and it's very addictive, I loved ARK already but this is so much better!!",True,0,0
"Open world, crafting, building, surviving, with the help of ""Pals"" and teammates. This game is fun and easy to enjoy. The learning curve is minor, while still unique. I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys building a base with their friends, exploring the vast open world, and likes to learn new things.",True,0,0
This game just needs more intense dungeons otherwise it will get boring when you reach the endgame,True,0,0
"It's a great game, my only recommendation is to take it slow, there's not many content released.",True,0,0
"great game! Played it on release, came back to it on feybreak update. Put 80 more hours into it and I'm breeding my perfect base rn.",True,0,0
"20 hours in the first 2 days... safe to say if you're into survival games, you'll get a good run out of this.",True,0,0
Better than most new pokemon games and it has plenty of fun things to do with great graphics! 10/10,True,0,0
"The mechanics and ever ending features of this game are honestly quite impressive. There is absolutely way too many things for only one person to do. What I'm trying to say is, even when you reach end-game, there is still a lot to do in the game. The building is one of the prettiest ones, I've spent about 30 hours of my total playtime solely on building bases around the map (They're pretty). Awesome game, awesome mechanics, awesome features, awesome tech tree. The game is great. Yes it does have issues, but the fun I've had trumps all flaws.",True,0,0
Its fun to hunt beasts with a gun and trap them in a tiny sphere only to put them to work after,True,0,0
"Slavery with extra steps, Pokemon with guns. overall thisgames got some funny bugs considering its in early access but its a really fun game.",True,0,0
"Fuck nintendo, play this game. Its so much better. can play multiplayer without needing to pay for an online sub. I'ts better way better ark survival.",True,0,0
"All the best parts of survival games like Ark and monster games like Pokemon, but the combination is truly unique and special",True,0,0
I already liked it at release and it improved and is still improving since. A great game to invest your time,True,0,0
"The game play is good, can get a little laggy if you're near a big base if you don't have a crazy good internet connection, but not too bad.",True,0,0
"Its like pokemon botw but theres too much ark in here, actually takes eons to do some stuff and things break all the time with all the level scaling too so it gets pretty annoying at times.",True,0,0
So much fun to mess around and the grind to become the best is satisfying,True,0,0
"Who doesn't love an amalgamation of Ark, Pokemon & Breath of the Wild? I sure love it. God, forcing sentient animals to work for me feels good. Its so fun.",True,0,0
"Was told this game was like ""pokemon with guns"", but it's more like ark survival with pokemon and guns. 

Having played numerous pokemon games, this is a sweet game.",True,0,0
"Great game for any kind of play style. I'm not even exaggerating. You can customize just about all world settings. Item drops, damage, stamina, time, catch rate, etc. They can all be changed and altered to the play style you as the player want. You can play solo or with friends. You can buff your damage to do a player damage run or the other way around. This is a legitimate sandbox that can be edited on the fly every start up of the world save. It has somewhat of a tutorial but it's simple enough to learn it without intrusive tutorials like many other games. The game isn't even finished yet and it's this good of a game. If you feel you have run out of things to do you simply haven't as the game is constant progress and even then you can make more and do better always. This doesn't even include the mods already present in the community or those that will likely be added in the future. If you have extra money and don't have the game yet you can't go wrong grabbing this game.",True,0,0
"For solo players: Essentially it's Pokemon + ARK, except its a lot more fun to play solo compared to ARK. In ARK playing alone gets lonely but in Palworld, with the more colorful & cartoony style, the inclusion of npcs, and the obvious relationships with pals, you'll only get bored if those aren't your types of games to begin with.",True,0,0
"Very fun so far rough in some areas.

The game is great near the start just going around catching stuff getting crafting stuff and building mid game hits you hard but as long as you prep right you should be good... However like a lot of other survival games the endgame is one hell of a grind. Items with 1% drop chances that require hours worth of materials to even craft, Enemies you think you can take on just one hitting you and your weapons feeling like a pea shooter. None of that being bad just very much takes a lot of time and energy and after that you'll most likely feel the survival game endgame drought... the hey you win have your own fun now part of the game... after already having the top tier weapons. This is where this game i feel is going to struggle not only do you pretty much need to find the legendary weapons and armour but once you have it there is nothing left... you can breed and make perfect pals but that only will hold you for so long.

The pals. Sometimes great other times sat on the food box getting sad and depressed... Pals in combat are fun but once you get to the end game you only really use about 20 or so of the pals that exist because their abilities are just that strong. Sure every game has those weapons or things that just suck and are ment to be starter stuff but when pretty much at the start of the game you can just level for the first hour and then just breed some of the strongest pals in the game from right at the start it made me feel really sad cause i spent a ton of time just figuring stuff out myself what pals i should use and all that. (Nyafia is great though)

Visuals make me wanna puke sometimes the pop in is pretty bad no matter how i muck with the settings imagine a switch game but with slightly better performance and honestly even then the game has some really bad performance now and then can just be flying around and then you'll start getting lag spikes from nowhere even with my settings optimised i couldn't escape it.
Dlss is also required to run this game at anything above 60 at least with my 3060 meanwhile can run monster hunter world smoothly at 120 fps without. This game just need a performance update desperately and personally if they were to launch the game as is right now  out of early access i don't think i would return.

Pal designs amazing... Character designs... i really don't feel em just very generic even the player character just feels bland a ton of videos online show people just using the same character options no variety at all honestly. Not much you can do about the npcs and bosses but at least give us more character customisation ( More voices, hair, faces pretty much everything just give us way more. 

If there is one thing i say i do hate its the fact they are doing a terraria colab... I just have a bad past with that game nothing to do about this game.

Game is still getting updates so this review will change when i play more and with game updates.",True,0,0
"Palworld: A Whimsical and Addictive Creature-Collecting Adventure
Palworld offers a unique and delightful twist on the creature-collecting genre, blending relaxing gameplay with exciting boss battles and a touch of strategy. It stands out among other games with its charming concept and engaging mechanics, making it perfect for both solo and multiplayer sessions.

Gameplay and Features
At its core, Palworld is about collecting, breeding, and battling with your Pals. The breeding system is a standout feature, letting players experiment to create the perfect Pal. While it can be a time-consuming process, it’s incredibly rewarding and adds depth to the experience. The ability to host servers where friends can join and help with boss fights is another fantastic addition, making the game even more enjoyable in co-op mode.

Content and Replayability
Palworld boasts an impressive amount of content for an early-access title. Regular updates keep the game fresh, offering new challenges and features that encourage players to return. The diverse activities, from building and crafting to battling and exploring, provide plenty of variety to keep you entertained for hours on end.

Graphics and Performance
While the graphics aren't groundbreaking, they suit the game’s playful tone well enough. The occasional issues, like Pals getting stuck or failing to complete their tasks, can be a bit annoying but are forgivable given the game’s early-access status. These minor hiccups don’t detract significantly from the overall experience.

Verdict
Palworld is a charming and unique game that successfully blends relaxation and excitement. Its fun mechanics, robust multiplayer options, and steady stream of content make it a joy to play. While not without its quirks, it’s clear the game has a bright future as it continues to develop.

Rating: 8.5/10
A delightful creature-collecting adventure with loads of potential. Perfect for casual play or sharing the fun with friends!",True,0,0
"I'm having an amazing time playing this game! With over 300 hours logged, time feels like it's flying by, and there's still so much more to explore and accomplish. The game is fantastic and brimming with potential. I really hope they continue to release new content consistently. I would highly recommend it to anyone!",True,0,0
"The best open-world game I've played. Although some of the Pal designs have many similarities to some Pokemon, there are enough unique creatures out there to find while exploring, very fun game!

It was inevitable for someone to come up with another monster training and catching game, after Pokemon has been failing for many years. To me, the Pokemon franchise's games have been declining in quality since the release of ORAS. ORAS was when Pokemon peaked, and it was the last game from them I owned. Since then, they have been struggling to come up with stupid gimmicks to replace mega-evolutions in each new game, and each one is more terrible than the one before (z-moves, dynamax, terastal, etc...). 

It's hard to comprehend what the hell the second most popular franchise in the monster-training genre, Digimon, has been doing for the past few years. Bandai, who owns the IP to the Digimon franchise, doesn't seem to care about western fans enough to bring over some of the games they release in Japan, and doesn't seem interested in making remakes of old GameBoy or PS1 games to release on modern console libraries, like other franchises are doing, it's like they just want to sit on their IP and not do anything with it on the west. They seem to just want the IP to die, and people to lose interest in it and forget it. I wish someone would buy that IP from them and actually do something with it.

All in all, very well made game, and it came at a time when the genre was struggling, which helped its success.",True,0,0
"Very high quality, even for an early access ""pokemon ripoff."" Can be grindy, but it has a unique style, is still being updated, supports multiplayer, and is only $30. Hope to see more games like it.",True,0,0
"Very fun, nice exploration and tech tree. Looking forward to future updates",True,0,0
"This game just keeps improving! Each update brings more content and a higher level of polish. My only disappointment is the change to the ball-throwing mechanic, which makes it harder to place your Pals exactly where you need them in combat. This change was due to the lawsuit with Nintendo, which regrettably was outside the creators' control.",True,0,0
"Palworld is an absolute gem for anyone who loves open-world adventure games with a twist of creativity. The concept of bonding with adorable creatures called ""Pals"" while exploring a vast, dynamic world is both innovative and incredibly engaging. The game masterfully combines elements of survival, farming, crafting, and combat, keeping the gameplay diverse and exciting.

One of the standout features is the freedom it gives players. Whether you want to peacefully build a cozy farm with the help of your Pals or dive into intense battles against hostile creatures, the choice is entirely yours. The seamless integration of multiplayer adds a social aspect that makes the experience even more enjoyable, especially when teaming up with friends to complete challenging quests.

The visuals are stunning, with vibrant environments and uniquely designed Pals that feel alive and full of personality. The soundtrack complements the game's atmosphere beautifully, immersing you further into the world of Palworld.

Another impressive aspect is the crafting and automation system, which allows you to design complex setups with your Pals. It’s both strategic and rewarding, adding depth to the gameplay.

Overall, Palworld offers a fresh and innovative experience for gamers of all kinds. Whether you’re a fan of Pokémon, Stardew Valley, or survival games, Palworld delivers something for everyone. It's a must-play and a shining example of creative game design!",True,0,0
"Palworld is the best parts of Ark and the best parts of Pokemon mixed together leaving arguably the worst elements behind. The balance in Palworld is surprisingly fair. In Ark many things you had to do were completely contingent on playing as a group wheras Palworld feels like it's much more considerate of a solo player. Not everyone who plays together wants to be in the same guild, and it's just fun being on the same map doing your own thing and sharing experiences, so it's nice that solo guilds can take on bosses and succeed. There's a lot of in depth and well thought out systems, it's especially impressive considering this is an early access game. Arguably the most complete feeling early access game I've ever played. Notable issues and complaints is that the game does crash frequently. Despite having all of the system requirements for the game I can't get the game to run except on the absolute lowest settings, which does make it look terrible compared to the screenshots.",True,0,0
"Honestly one of the funnest games I've played in a while, it may get grindy for some things but besides that i have a ton of fun playing its also more fun with friends.",True,0,0
"pretty fun game, features a whole lot of things to do. the best part is undeniably the vast amount of pals available and the plenty of islands to roam around. not to mention bosses, raid towers and caverns that make exploring a treat

howeverrr, the game is pretty consistent and fun in the start, but as you level up it gets grindier. so far it hasn't felt very draining to grind for resources thanks to the great atmosphere and the cool little pals, but it's something quite prevalent through the game and only gets worse as you level further.

although, the worst part for me about this game has been the jank. it can feel very buggy, and i understand the devs are going for an ark-styled gameplay but it really does feel a little too wonky at times. hope that gets fixed as the game escapes its early access phase.",True,0,0
"Love the game.
The new NPCs/quests add some extra fun. Can't wait to see future updates.",True,0,0

"Alright, let's dive into the wild and wacky world of Palworld!

Imagine if Pokémon decided to go on a survival adventure, got a bit gritty, and decided to arm itself with a shotgun. That’s Palworld in a nutshell! This game is a delightful mix of creature collecting, base building, and survival crafting, with a twist that’ll make you do a double-take.

In Palworld, you’re dropped into a vast, open-world filled with mysterious creatures called Pals. These aren’t your typical cute and cuddly critters – they’re more like anime-inspired beasts that you can befriend, train, and even weaponize. Think of it as Pokémon meets Mad Max with a dash of Grounded.

The survival mechanics are deep and engaging. You’ll need to gather resources, build a base, and fend off both wild Pals and hostile human factions. The combat is a blast, with a mix of traditional monster-catching and intense shootouts. It’s like playing a high-stakes game of capture the flag, but with more lasers and explosions.

One of the best parts of Palworld is the creativity it encourages. You can customize your Pals, build elaborate bases, and even use your Pals to help with tasks like farming and crafting. The game’s sense of humor shines through in its irreverent tone and quirky characters, making it a joy to play even when things get tough.

The community is vibrant and supportive, with players sharing tips, trading Pals, and teaming up for epic battles. The developers keep things fresh with regular updates and events, ensuring there’s always something new to discover.

So, if you’re ready for a game that’s equal parts adorable and chaotic, Palworld is calling your name. Grab your gear, befriend some Pals, and get ready for an adventure that’s as unpredictable as it is unforgettable!

Happy Paling! 🦾✨🚀",True,0,0
"Pokemon with guns! Not really, but that's what people say. I prefer to say ""Hey Nintendo, you just trying to protect your IP? Well I pee on your IP then I will emulate all of your games and stream them on Twitch while I make money off your back and make sure you don't get a damn dime!"" After becoming a millionaire from pirate Nintendo games I will then teach classes on the easiest way to emulate all of your games, then while I claim my award for best millionaire I will thank Palworld for making such an incredible game while I literally drop my pants and take a shit on whatever shitty console Nintendo has prematurely released at that time. I can't wait for the day Nintendo shoves their tail between their legs and begs to let them port Palworld to the underpowered console they release. Nintendo has shamed themselves and all the corporate fat cats getting rich and putting out junk games that no one wants.

Ok, for real now. This is a light survival game with an emphases on base building and production, borrowing from several genres really. Very pleasing art style, the combat feels pretty good, very nice assortment of weapons. Most of the bugs I have come across have been fixed with updates, which seem to come out fairly frequently. Good job Pocket Pair! This is quite a fantastic game!",True,0,0

Love this game they took all fun aspects of certain games an mixed them beautifly. I personly dont play pvp unless its just with my friends but game is extremly fun to drind solo or with friends. I cant wait for more pals updates. I hope they do add more into the world thats already exsiting mostly the top right desert an snow area an some more buildings but other than that i give this game a 9/10 extremely fun if you like survival games an battle monster games must try!!!,True,0,0
ok this is fun sometimes laggy because i dont have all the requirements but this has a lot of fun unique designs also the fact that you can catch humans is insane i always thought of it as a joke that you might be able to catch humans in pokemon but here we are catching humans 9/10 would recommend,True,0,0
This game continues to be such a great asset to my Steam library - I've come back to it a couple times and each time the content has grown and the game seems fresh.,True,0,0
"It's just a solid game, man.

It's got a lot going for it as a survival game and as a monster collecting game, the music is pretty solid, the gameplay loop is what you'd expect from a survival game, and the sheer power you feel as a human with guns or telling a pal with rocket launchers to nuke something is something that really gets the monkey brain going. The experience of Michael Bay explosions behind me (more like in front of me I suppose) as I jet towards a level 5 unsuspecting sheep that doesn't know it'll be nothing more than wool and meat in a few seconds is power creep you could only dream of in a monster collecting game.

I run my own dedicated server with my friends and girlfriend and I am thankful to have a game that brought us back together to gaming for a bit, even if I spend a little more time these days alone on my server creating the ultimate, somewhat inbred, lifmunk or whatever goofy pal that shouldn't be able to take on a legendary but does it anyway.

"This is a very fun game that combines ARK: Survival Evolved, Pokemon, and a little bit of TLOZ: BOTW. Palworld's combat is way more action-packed than Pokemon, since Palworld is real-time. The base building is fun, and the game gives players a lot of freedom to do whatever they want to.",True,0,0

I would suggest a few updates to building though... like when building things like walls adding a tilt to adjust things to a non flat surface (hills or inclines). Other than that it is a fantastic and lovable game, definitely recommended.",True,0,0

"Is Palworld glitchy and full of bugs? Yes. 
Copy Pokemon designs and alter them slighty? Yes.
Does Palworld do anything innovative? No, not really.
Have any coherent story? No.

Is it fun to play with friends? [b] Yes, 100% [/b]

Palworld is proof that even a deeply flawed experience can be positive if the game is simply fun. Palworld is a game you can waste away the time with friends doing stuff that doesn't always make sense or matter, but you do it because it's fun.


On another note:
Nintendo's lawsuit against Pocketpair sets a dangerous precedent when it comes to patent laws. Regardless if you like/dislike Pocketpair or like/dislike Nintendo, the fact a company of any kind can make these types of patents for mechanics in video games that are easily replicated actions should be against the law and discourages creative freedom. No one should be rejoicing about this.  Hopefully this opens more people's eyes to how much of an issue this really is, otherwise we are going to have other big companies stomping out the competition of indie games with these tactics that encourage monopolization.",True,0,0

 -allow some construction clipping, like walls into terrain. (already works with foundations and terrain)
- allow the placing of walls next to roofs/stairs after the roof/stairs have already been placed. 
- make the Pal AI less brain-dead, (Getting stuck on a pebble so they abandon a task)

Conclusion: It is fun and i enjoy the general building mechanics, Fighting needs some minor improvements but is still enjoyable, Get this game, support the fight against Nintendo, and support the devs, they need it.",True,0,0
It's overall a really fun game and addictive. I love the whole open world concept of it and the survival skills and adventuring you do throughout the game. I would highly recommend this game to other people as well.,True,0,0
"Just started playing and I'm loving it! Nice to be able to adjust Game Settings on so many aspects, as I'm not a fan of having to grind-crazy for resources and extreme-limited weight carrying capabilities in survival games.",True,0,0
A solid game. I have spent a lot more money on games from huge game developers and not spent as much time or had as much fun as playing this game.,True,0,0
"A fun game which brings plenty of enjoyment, however, it is just like every other 'survival' game by the end; grind. Though a grind that, if I am honest, I did not enjoy as much as other survival games. Even the hardcore ones that focus on the more primitive side of things kept me more engaged on average.

Though it isn't as bad as the likes of Ark (thank god), don't understate how boring it can be at times. I loved collecting all the pals. I fucking loathed getting crude oil every single second I needed it and getting legendary schematics for guns above level 50 (as of writing this review) is such a chore due to how LOW the drop chances are... I'd actually rather go play another game. 

I love this game, but holy FUCK is the end-game as boring as watching paint dry sometimes.

I will most likely come back to this every now and again, maybe jump into single-player for a bit, but it will be with mods and changed settings. I'm here to make a slave business, not wait 3 days for a legendary huge egg to crack open OR MAYBE get a legendary schematic for the Laser Gatling at a 0.75% chance, or an even worse 0.0425% chance from the new dungeon. Just... Just no.

 I'll gladly continue to support Palworld and the (potential, I hope) DLCs it may come with, just note that it will kick you in the balls with its grind come late-game. 10/10 would enslave pals again.",True,0,0

"Solid game to binge - get tired of - and return to at a later date after updates. I've been playing around with Palworld since it first became available and after hitting the original level cap and catching all the pals, I took a lengthy break. Now upon my return there's been a multitude of QOL updates and expansions added - all included in the base game FYI - that brought back the joy of exploration once again. 

10/10 would recommend.",True,0,0

"People make the obvious comparison to pokemon.  but while it shares the monster catching and breeding, Palworld has a lot more in common with games like Grounded.  Crafting and base building dominate your time more than monster battling.

The base building/resource management is very fun. despite being early access it's kept me entertained for 200+ hours and once you hit max level there is plenty of breeding and raiding to keep you occupied. 

There are some serious resource bottlenecks where your progress will grind to a halt until you're able to create enough of the required materials to progress. Without knowing which resources are going to be really crucial it can be difficult to plan around this. I probably could have progressed a lot quicker if it'd known ahead of time how key ore, coal and oil would be. other resources like quartz you think will be important, only to very rarely need them.

There are many known bugs, but it's early access so to be expected. hopefully it will get more stable over time. 

Cautious recommend on the basis the devs stick with it and finish the job (so many early access games never reach 1.0)

This game is a great game all things considered. Easy to pick up and play at any time. I took a pause after launch and just came back after 6 or so months and the game has added so many quality of life changes. the Alignment Mode for building makes my OCD so much better when trying build. 11/10 rating from me for that singular change.,True,0,0
"Pokemo- *Blocked by NINTENDO®* but with: firearms, warfare weapons, multiplayer, world building, Legends Arece- *Blocked by NINTENDO®, again* style combat, and runs natively on PC, and modding support. what else do you want, servers like Minecra- *Blocked by MICROSOFT®*, SIKE it has those.



[u] The only problem is there is no crossplay RIGHT NOW [/u] (DEC 31, 2024) but the developers made it clear that that is a goal. Right now Steam purchases can only play with Steam, PlayStation with PlayStation and Xbox ecosystem with Xbox ecosystem (this way you can play the pc gamepass version with the Xbox gamepass version). So beware of this.",True,0,0
"Played about 30 hrs when it first released, was good but not enough content.
Two weeks ago I started back with family/friends and we're having a blast.  Lots of content, battle arena, raids, improvements, etc.  I'm having a blast.  Easily worth it's price.  I recommend renting a server (there are many great companies to purchase from) and playing with friends.

"This is a Good Game but as its early access I have noticed a few things Id like to see and You as the consumer should know.

-Pathfinding
Its SUPER weird, bigger pals get stuck and you HAVE to make a 2x2 doorway if your making a indoor house for them, they WILL NOT go through the Human Sized Doorway if they are BIG pals or even MEDIUM pals 

Small Lack of Automation Options are another small QOL issue, not being able to autocraft Meals for your pals means youll have to micromanage as you progress and make more and more bases as you CANNOT just keep your pals on berries

Overall Its an amazing game for early access and im excited to see what else they add. HEAVILY recommend you guys to buy it",True,0,0

"I have played palworld on and off since it came out and I can say for 100% this is a pretty fun game as of the latest update, almost all of the issues and problem palworld had for me with progression has pretty much been implemented.
8 out of 10 or 4 out of 5 game for me, palworld's biggest problem from a creative standpoint is how janky the entire building aspect is in this game. 
If you don't build towns and houses and other such builds this game is wonderful 10 out of 10 from a pure survival standpoint.
However from a creation pov there is no good ""snap"" system so builds float a few inches away from walls, you cant place beds,tables,chairs, or anything of the sort on top of rugs and carpets>
There are no stairs that start in 1 direction and go in another on 1 base floor tile, there is no half-walls for better build creativity and freedom and there is no way to increase the pal base circle size which limits most builds.
On top of that pals can spawn INSIDE pal base circles making almost all defenses noted in the technology section pointless other than like bear traps.

Also I would like to add, The pal naming system should be put in a better place and it should be allowed to be accessed outside of the palbox, I also want pals to be able to be moved around on your teams without being in the palbox.

ALSO FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING GOOD AND TRUE FIX THE STAIRS THEY ARE SO INFURIATING TO BUILD AROUND, you cant place a stay over or under a stair without putting wall and floor between them and you cant place and triangle wall to the sides of the stairs after they were already placed and you cant place walls under stairs after they were already placed....... WHYYYYYYYYY 
IS THE PROBLEM YOU DONT WANT PALWORLD TO TURN INTO FORTNITE OR SOMETHING???????

You can explore bigger areas. Within those areas there are pals (which are simply monsters) and you can capture them. And their design is so good you wanna catch most of them :)

You can breed stuff to make better pals or to get pals you havent caught yet. There are breeding combinations so it is not random what you get.

There are a few gym lea- Sorry, I meant tower guardians. Those are pal tamers where you have to fight against their pal.",True,0,0

"Palword is one of many, many open world crafting survival games to hit Steam in recent years.
Similar to most of the Asian survival crafting games I've played this one takes a lot of inspiration from modern Zelda in its movement, character progress, and map progress.

From what I can tell there are 140 pals available in the world currently. Pals offer a lot of visual variety, and have some cute animations. The player has very limited control over these pals, but a good amount of direction is offered.

Pal interaction is rather limited. Weaknesses and advantage don't seem to exist here. The biggest factor determining the winner or lose of battles is simply level. 
EDIT: I've been informed the above is incorrect. There is an RPS element to the title, however as a player I did not find to be strong or impactful on battles. I've also learned that PALs do have something akin to EV stats, making some pals simply stronger than others. 

The progress is very grindy, and rather boring. It doesn't break off from its formula. You'll find the loop pretty early, and they intended to keep you running the loop for as long as they can.

It's cute for a little while but it's not very good. If you want something cozy to play for a while, you might find what you're looking for. If you're looking for a strong pokemon themed multiplayer title, this is probably not it. 
The vast majority of players will never see end gamae because the journey to get there is simply too damn boring. 

Leaving recomendation as positive as it's not a bad title, but in reality I would suggest most players skip this one.",True,0,0

"I honestly wouldn't have ever expected a game that tries to do it all to be any good, yet Palworld somehow manages it.  It's basically a survival crafting game like Ark or Conan: Exiles, but replace dinosaurs and human slaves with pokemon-esque creatures called pals.  The pals, like pokemon, have elemental typings which are weak and strong against other elements, and they each have their own unique abilities for combat as well as for use in your home base and while exploring the world.  While the game is still in early access there's already quite a lot to see and to do and there's a decent amount of polish here, and the devs seem to be producing new content at a decent pace and also taking feedback from players.  

I'm not usually grabbed by these sorts of games but something about this one has pulled me in.  Maybe it's the charm, maybe it's the not-pokemon, maybe it's just the sheer amount of stuff in it, or some combination.  But it's worth keeping an eye on for sure.",True,0,0

The fact that this game can combine all of the things that I like into one, makes me happy, and I truly hope it can make others happy as well, and I hope it stays for good.",True,0,0
