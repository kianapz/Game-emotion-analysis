"Bought this solely to support their fight against Nintendo.

It's a decent game though, It's like ARK but actually fun combat and more in depth creatures.

"if Nintendo are suing Pocketpair for actually making a quality game that improves on every aspect that pokemon cant with the same recycled unfinished trash

Then these devs have done something right and their game needs all the attention and money they can get",True,73,1
"good game plenty of playtime just with a single playthrough, big map to explore, better with friends, the base building stuff needs to be fixed a little bit but is still very good, the update added lots of stuff to do and explore, i definitely got my moneys worth since this game is priced fairly.",True,1,0
"A great and fun game which at times makes me surprised that it's still in early access. However, there are some minor bugs that need to be addressed by the devs",True,3,0
It's a very fun game. With randomized mode makes the game more challenging. I hope one day we get some cross play action. My only issue are the random bugs and crashes with the new update. Even with that the game is still fun,True,2,0

"This is a great game!  Worth giving it a try, cute monsters and nice base building / survival aspects.
My biggest complaint would be there isn't a way to build a ""poke center"" type building to heal my monsters to full without needing to just put them back into the pc.",True,1,0
"Great game, wish they bring back the ball throw to release pals.  Also fuck nintendo",True,1,0
"This is what pokemon should have been. Nintendo needs to take some notes and listen to fans the way pocket pair is. I love the base building, combat, leveling, and that you can utilize the pals in so many ways. And with the new update. So excited.",True,1,0
"This game get compared to Pokemon allot but in all honestly I would compare more to ARK. 
Personally I would choose to play this over ARK. ARK is more hard core and less buggy but this game is just more fun. 

Some people have a very big problem with some monsters taking inspiration from Pokemon, sometimes heavy inspiration. But I think its like saying Agumon and Charmander are too similar and Digimon is a rip off of Pokemon, which was said back in the day. The Monster Collector Genre should have more competition in it to explore what can be done in it.",True,3,0
"Gud Game. If you like catching MONSTERS in balls and putting them in you [strike] POCKET [/strike] pouches, give this a try. If you also like guns and rocket launchers, this game is a must buy!",True,1,0
Its a really cute game. Please keep working on it and dont abandon it,True,1,0

"SO addictive omg , tho its awfull with big saves and can be buggy SOMETIMES. its SO good so far tho 1000000/10 would recomend!",True,1,0
Its what pokemon should have been years ago (minus the guns and murder of course). Being able to explore the world along side your pals each with their own specializations and abilities is what pokemon has been needing for years.,True,1,0
"its just a pokemon game but you can catch people in pokeballs, eat your pokemons, make your pokemons work untill they die. You can give a minigun to your pokemon, breed your pokemons, build a base where pokemons are workers AND MUCH MORE!",True,3,0
I love this game. Heck I even adore it too! It scratched an itch that Ninten-don't. I def recommend it to anyone to just give it a try!,True,1,0
"The game somehow scratches the both the base building and the creature collecting itch, and they work so well together. You have the incentive to get a decent Pal for battling and also for base optimising, it's great.

Oh and by the way, fuck Nintendo and this lawsuit",True,2,0
Just to support this game. You will not regret to buy this game unless we lost the fight and the game will be shut down permanently. We will see,True,3,0
Big ups to the developers for continuing to release updates and push new content when many others in similar positions would have already started releasing paid DLC. This is a rare example of early access done right.,True,3,0
"I do really enjoy my in-game expeditions for materials or Pals and my base building.
Palworld is the magic that happens when a company sits on it's IP for too long, afraid to innovate.
Neentend0 got away with their pal~mon games for way too long,
Now they just sue the competition because you AIM the ball to initiate battle. Next move should be changing the ball to a cube or something.
The developer Pocketpair will have all my support.",True,2,1
so fun !!!!!!!!!!!! if you love pokemon or minecraft (both) you will adore palworld!! worth the money have fun hope you love it to,True,1,0
"Great game, totally addictive. Beautiful scenery, fun adventure, great bosses and pals are so fun to catch.",True,1,0
"This game is really fun, it mixes both my partners and Is preference for games which is really nice as that means it doesnt burn us out as easily as others.

While he prefers more automation and fighting, I prefer exploration and looking at cute things (lol) and this game very lovingly has both and MORE!
I would recommend this over and over again <3

Also fuck Nintendo.

"At first, when I saw this game on the steam marketplace 6 months ago, I was angry that they obviously copied from pokemon. Then... I played the game and found it to be a fantastic blend of many games I enjoy, including pokemon, a little elden ring (map scale, geography), a little minecraft, a little monster hunter, and it really is a great game that stands on its own -- MOSTLY. 

I dont think the pokemon company should be suing this dev any more than From Soft should sue every ""soulslike"" game dev, or Blizzard should sue every Warcraft/Starcraft clone (RTS games in general). I support Palworld!!",True,1,0
"I actually really like this game, not like PokeMon at all. Its more like Ark, but actually better since it isn't stupid grindy. It actually has some automation. I do wish yall released the game at 1.0 because content did run out fast, (around 30 hrs playtime) but it was interesting.",True,2,0
"fantastic game mechanics, great user experience. A recommendation for pro gamers, as well as beginners.",True,1,0
"this game is awesome some people says its a pokemon rip off but as a pokemon fan myself i do not really see that  =) the only thing pokemon like is the palspheres but thats the monster catching genre in a nutshell palworld  is more comparable to ark survival evolved  then pokemon

"Its what you expect - capture the Pals, build bases, put them to work, go out and capture more. They make stuff so you can get stronger, go out and explore. I like it better than other similar games, but its nothing revolutionary. I enjoy it, but it didnt hook me in. if you like ARK, youll like this, as long as youre fine with there being no PVP.",True,1,0
"It is hard to boil down what makes Palworld so special.  It has the charming character design of a creature collector, the vast vibrant landscapes of an adventure RPG, and the feel of a survival sandbox game like Ark or Rust in a more animated and cartoonish vibe.  But you don't sacrifice any quality for any of those design choices.  It truly is more than the sum of it's parts in my eyes.  Fantastic game solo, and is even better with friends.  And the developers aren't pushing microtransaction garbage either.  Nothing but positive things to say about my experience.  I've played on and off since launch and has been a fantastic year thus far!  Looking forward to even more in the future!",True,1,0
"it is skibidi sigma, i have 43.8 hours on this game and i really like it. mommy said that my bases are super duper sigma. i show her the pals i would smash and pass. but not number 69 >:(. 69 is my unfavorite pal becuz of the ""personality"" to de pokemo- i mean pal.... this game deserves game of the year every year untill january second 2025. goodnight pookies and keep looking at pal number 69.",True,1,1
"To call this game an innovation is a joke and shows how creatively bankrupt the gaming industry is and how brainwashed you are.

The game is fun and all but it's nothing special by any metric.

im shur that this game is awesome but im disappointed that its unavailable on mac. as a new mac player i did not know that many games would not work for me i hope i can get a refund,False,0,2
"ok so this game isnt for everyone and i want to make that clear. the first thing i found annoying was the character creation screen; its just full of cringy-ass anime personas with main character syndrome, it takes far too long to make a character look like an actual person (but thats just my opinion that nobody shares). the second thing (that def relates to some of you) is that this game was NOT made for low-end pcs. ive got a >$1000 msi gaming laptop and i had to set most of the settings to potato so i could play the game above 15 fps. i havent really explored a lot of the content but i partly like this game so much because of the eye candy, but thats because im used to half life 2 on potato settings and not games released in the past 20 years.",True,0,0
Yeah. Very unique... great game... Buy it! Play through it... wait for an update... play through it again... wait for the next big update... PLAY IT AGAIN! Enjoy.,True,0,0
its a really creative game that allows your mind to go places with building. also has detailed looks on the pals (creatures),True,0,0
Super fun and addicting. Not too fond of some of the changes they had to make to appease the owners of Pokemon but still really cool and addicting game.,True,0,0
This game is good! The base building and fighting of pals is very fun. Although the AI for controlling your pals is awful. Its so bad,True,0,0
"I was skeptical since i dont like modern day pokemon. but, seeing all my starter pals show funny emotions while working, fighting, or dying made me laugh. its pretty fun. cant wait to advance further in the skill trees",True,0,0
"pals should have slight size variations and personalities; examples- pal ""AGE"", pal satiation level (thin when starving) or really round depending on trait and posture. pal clothes too, that'd be dope. like sweaters for the flying types or timbs for the rock types. and also the organizations and factions should have claimable vehicles that can serve as a mobile pal box with a hefty upgrade cost. i feel like it still lacks. we got the most elements but they arent all dancing together yet.",True,0,0
"Well built world, plenty of opportunity to grow, good graphic and animation, plenty of choice on how to develop. Good for casual and experienced players. Would be even better if you could access your friends world while they are offline as well.",True,0,0
"Love building bases while having automation, their twist on it is awesome and fun! My only issue was the loc.sav file, because i wanted to buy a server and play with people more easily. After trail and error i found out i wasn't able too because how the file is saved, but awesome game!!! More content, less animations!

P.S.
Fix ownership of pals*, ive lost so many pals* to my guild* and a recent pals* used tab... nobody throws all their pals* in a box without a little know how and where my used pals* are / new pals* are etc. ( change the word to pals to ""clothes"" and guild to ""friend"" and you can see the issue in a real life example lol).",True,0,0
good survival game with good gameplay and graphics. love it ...,True,0,0
"Love this game.
Recently took a break to let more content come but never the less I always return. Definitely a great game.",True,0,0
so i mostly play in solo play mode. i tried to play the game online when it first came out. but at the time there was so many hackers that every time u logged in you'd have to start over from the very beginning. and and now after a year of this game has been out many good updates have come out. i still dont know anything about online play since those early days as i havnt found a new server that was doing a fresh start,True,0,0
Game is very fun and with friends as well. Settings helps alot with how the world interacts to you on difficulty and how many pals spawn and or where they can spawn with a randomizer. I just wish cross play was out already.,True,0,0
"This game is honestly really good, i hope they can win the lawsuit and continue building this game. 10/10 
it's literally as if Ark and Pokemon had a baby, this would be it.",True,0,0
"I highly recommend this game both for how fun and interesting it can be but also how challenging it can be first starting out. There's a lot to take in when you first take on the tutorial challenges but once you got the basics down, the only limitations you have are the ones you set yourself via the world settings.

I mean, that and the amount of space you have for building from the Base starter and pal management area. But besides that! Super fun over all. Little limited on the furniture options without mods. That's alright though especially if you're not focused on making your base pretty!",True,0,0
Solid adventure survival and monster taming mechanics. Everything you expect from a typical craft/build/survival genre and a monster tamer game put together. It has a lot of fun abilities and items. The mechanics are fairly self explanatory if you are a gamer but if you are new to gaming it could use a little bit more hand-holding. As it is in early access there is frequent updates and content being added. Even if it were to be officially released at this stage it is a fairly full game with lots of things to do. I will probably end up putting way more time in it.,True,0,0
