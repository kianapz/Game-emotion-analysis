"if Nintendo are suing Pocketpair for actually making a quality game that improves on every aspect that pokemon cant with the same recycled unfinished trash

Then these devs have done something right and their game needs all the attention and money they can get",True,514,9

It's a decent game though, It's like ARK but actually fun combat and more in depth creatures.

"The start of this game is so good. I played together with a friend and had a blast the first 30 levels or so. But man does the pacing get ruined in mid game.
The fun I got from playing Palworld was mainly from exploring the world, finding and catching new pals and collecting collectibles. But when you enter mid game, which is around level 30 you can't progress by simply exploring anymore. You instead need to farm materials to craft necessary items and farm the same pals you've already caught to gain exp. And this loop of farming and running around can go on for hours.
Me and my friend changed the world settings (higher drops etc) to make it more bearable but even so the game was too boring for me to want to continue. And it's so frustrating because the beginning of the game was so much fun and I wish the developers would've designed the game progression to be like that through out the whole game.
There's more stuff I could criticize the game for but what's written above is the main complaint I have and what made me stop playing.",False,109,20
"It's good, not great. It's a monster party game, you run around and catch your monsters, etc. But you only have a party of five and there are always going to be utility slots taken up for your personal movement and the like. Each pal can only actively have three moves slotted in, too, and given it's all real time it runs on cool downs instead - which is horrible if your pal whiffs and now everyone is twiddling their thumbs. Part of this is covered up by some pals being mountable, so you can fight as them, and then you yourself can have a weapon and run around. Except just you shooting most things is a lot more consistent, DPS-wise, as you don't have a cooldown even if you do less damage, so at some point once you're established the game becomes flying in on a bird, shotgunning a deer in the face before throwing a legally distinct pokeball at them and flying off again. Which is entertaining, but also pretty much the entire gameplay loop so things start to get stale. And you kinda have to do it, too, as everything is level-gated in a surprisingly stifling way.

But! It's also a thirty dollar game, so it being good, not great, is perfectly fine. Pal with your buds. It has jank, but nothing show stopping.",True,11,3
"I have played this game since the release of early access, this is an amazing game. I had great experience with this game so far. Yes, it has issues, especially end game, but overall it has more pros than cons for this price range. So far devs addressed many game breaking issues and keep improving the base game while adding new content. I recommend everyone giving a try, it is more fun with friends if you can afford to host your own dedicated server. I don't like how public ones are handled though, I don't recommend them.

"Great Idea, Disappointing Execution
The concept behind Palworld is absolutely brilliant. It’s what many players have been wishing for: a blend of Pokémon, survival gameplay, and sandbox adventure. For players who aren’t too concerned about technical details and just want to enjoy the gameplay, I can still recommend this game. It has its moments and can be fun if you’re not looking too closely at its flaws.

However, as a software developer and hobbyist game designer with experience in UE5, I find it hard to overlook the many issues that hold this game back. These problems might not bother everyone, but from my perspective, they significantly detract from the overall experience.

I understand that my negative opinion might not be popular, I've never been a popular person anyway xD, but this is the perspective of someone who knows the tools and workflows of UE5. And from that standpoint, Palworld feels like a missed opportunity.
After spending considerable time with the game, here are the key issues I’ve noticed:

1. The AI: Broken and Frustrating
The AI in Palworld is poorly implemented. NPCs and Pals often run into obstacles, get stuck, or act illogically. The pathfinding feels almost non-existent, which repeatedly breaks immersion. This is particularly noticeable during combat, where enemies frequently get stuck against walls or fail to navigate properly. As a result, the battles feel clunky and unengaging, making them more frustrating than fun.
As someone with experience in AI development, I can confidently say this level of AI is unacceptable, especially when using modern tools like UE5.

2. The World: Generic and Empty
The game world feels lifeless and unfinished. Large, empty areas are filled with randomly scattered objects and items, while Pals roam aimlessly without any sense of purpose. With UE’s free assets (like Megascan), and the PCG Framework (Or Voxel), it would be possible to create a richer, more immersive world in just one day. Unfortunately, Palworld feels like it lacks the thoughtful design and detail needed to bring its world to life.

3. Animations: Clunky and Outdated
The animations are incredibly awkward. UE provides so many tools and features that can simplify and improve animation workflows, even for small teams. It’s baffling that a game built on this engine can deliver such unpolished animations. With proper budgeting and time, this could, and should, have been far better.

4. The Building System: Low Budget
The building system in Palworld feels incredibly low effort. It reminds me a lot of the Player Building System package available on the UE marketplace (https://www.fab.com/listings/c3806e8d-1903-47b3-97c2-378f279c399b), which was free for a time. While this package is functional, it’s clearly a template designed for prototyping rather than a polished feature for a full release.

5. Visual Style: Inconsistent and Disjointed
While graphics aren’t the most important aspect of a game, they do play a major role in immersion. In Palworld, the cartoony Pals and NPCs clash heavily with the semi realistic environment. On top of that, the Pals appear almost placeholder like with their low-poly style. A consistent low-poly aesthetic for the entire game might have worked better than this mismatched ""Frankenstein"" style. Additionally, the game’s LOD settings are strange and contribute further to the visual inconsistency.

6. Technology: Unreal Engine Not Fully Utilized
UE is one of the most powerful tools available to developers, offering countless features to make development easier and more efficient. Yet Palworld feels like a game that barely scratches the surface of what this engine can do. It comes across as unfinished, as though the developers either didn’t have enough time or didn’t fully leverage the tools at their disposal.

Final Thoughts: Great Potential, But Little Substance
I really wanted to like this game. The idea is fantastic, but the execution left me disappointed. I found myself constantly thinking, “This could have been done so much better!”.

I might even spend my next vacation creating a Palworld clone to demonstrate how some of these issues could be addressed. With the power of UE5, there’s no reason this game couldn’t have been much more polished.",False,8,0
"TLDR; Its ark, but actually functional and fun.

Jokes aside, this is a really good game from an indie studio. Although people say its a ripoff of pokemon, its honestly closer to survival / base building games like ark. And it outshines both in those aspects, doing more than either have done in the last few years.",True,2,0
"Nintendo can suck it, this game is everything you wish Pokemon would do, and more. Stop buying Nintendo's regurgitated garbage. Don't let Nintendo con you in to a ""new"" game, and then never update or give you anything new. I'm so sick of Nintendo releasing a ""new"" game just to abandon it and make an other ""new"" game at the same expensive price. Palworld has Updates and new content. Stop giving money to these mega corps that don't give a shit about you or their game.",True,3,0
"It's base building and combat with cutsey allies.  You are sure to get at least a week of so enjoyment out of it.  There are some mechanics that are annoying like the weight and temperature mechanics, but these don't detract much from the game.  The base building is satisfyingly rapid and strategic and there are a number of decorative options for people interested in that.  I will say for those hoping to do multiplayer, that the multiplayer is very basic.  You have to either give other players a code each time you start up, play on public servers, or run your own server.  Emotes are also almost nonexistent.   Still, I'm sure things will improve and you can still make it happen with your buddies!  I recommend to all strategy and fps fans!",True,1,0
"The animations are cute, and the gameplay loop is enjoyable.  They have game settings right from the start that let you minimize the grinding you have to do, which was a blessing, and you can change them any time you start up that save, which is even better.  I would not allow young children to play it, though.  Pokemon is cutesy and tee hee they just fainted.  Palworld takes rocket launchers to people and pals alike, and has a lot more adult content.  Nothing graphic, but the concepts behind some of this stuff aren't what I'd put in front of kids if you have any who might want to watch you play.

If you don't want to breed super powerful pals, you aren't going to be able to interact much with the higher end content/raid bosses, which is a negative for people who don't have time to actively sit there and breed 116 of the same pal to cram into the one they want to upgrade.

Overall I enjoy the game, but it IS in early access still, and there are a lot of bugs related to the pal AI.  They put out updates fairly regularly, but it is still annoying to have things spawn in odd places and slowly starve into insanity without you knowing,",True,1,0
"my wife makes me host a dedicated server, bought me this game, and then makes me AFK on the base all day to make the pals work harder, she says I have to give 10/10.",True,4,3
"Even with the extreme amount of hype for this game, it still exceeds my expectations.
Realistically, this game is VERY upfront with how it works. You can buy it, try it, and if you don’t like the basic gameplay loop, you will not like the rest of the game.

[b]Main aspects[/b]
The world is huge.
The base building is complex and enjoyable.
The pals and you each fight on their own, but you can ride/control pals if you want.
The combat is extremely fun, and far doesn’t get old at all.
The AI is pretty terrible, but the game is still EA. Even if it didn’t get fixed, this wouldn’t be “that” bad that it’s a deal breaker (to me).
There are some minor bugs, but people get way too bent out of shape over them.
The exploration for the game is amazing. There are legitimate rewards that make you want to look in every nook and cranny. So far, this is probably my favorite part of the game. Also, Lifmunk Effigies are honestly so much fun to hunt for.

[b]Something else they got right.[/b]
It's like each decision they made, they thought to themselves, ""what would be most fun to play?""
This seems obvious, but other games usually lack this. For example, ARK's base creation takes TONS of resources, even just for walls. You then have to place the wall, then sit there hammering it. Building a simple house can take FOREVER. Palworld sees the good of this approach, and removes the monotony of it, so it’s cheap and immediate.
When you destroy something, it gives you ALL the resources back, so you can experiment with your base without feeling like you’re wasting resources.
When you build, the game accessing ALL inventory within the base to use as resources, so you don’t have to keep going back and forth between storage.
You can ride Pals very early on, and even fly very early on, rather than waiting the whole game for it.
There’s just a lot of things in the game where it really feels like the devs chosen enjoyment over other unimportant things like realism or grind. They just wanted to make a fun game, and they succeeded.

[b]The bad stuff[/b]
You’ll see people complaining about bugs… people do that all the time about everything. From my experience there are very few bugs. I have clipped under the ground on a few occasions, but I’ve been able to remedy it fairly easily. That said, I’ve turned off drops on death, not to make the game easier, but because I don’t want to lose everything just because of a terrain bug (this almost happened just a while ago). That said, gear actually isn’t that hard to make, so it’s not even that big of a deal.
I believe there might be some multiplayer bugs for servers, but I also see them trying to fix these in their news reports.
The game doesn’t really have any story or anything, which is kinda lame at times. It’s completely open, and the only thing to guide you are little quests in the top that are basically irrelevant and you could completely ignore. After a while all they are, are “go here and kill this thing”. They have cool looking anime characters that are full of potential, but they do absolutely nothing with them, lol. There’s no story, no character development at all, they don’t talk, there’s no story. That said, the game is going in such a good direction, that I actually don’t want them to waste valuable dev time expanding the story/character elements, but it would be nice.
The game doesn’t hold your hand at all, so sometimes you pretty much need to look stuff up online. For example, I’m really trying not to just follow online guides, so at the moment I have no idea where to get quartz in the world, except from this one boss battle. I really need quartz, and I’ve explored far and wide and can’t find it, so I’ll probably have to break down and Google it.
Pal rarity should be more interesting. It’s basically just location, and then day/night cycle. Nothing is actually “rare” in this sense, and you don’t feel like you need to hunt them. There should be an element of having to hunt, and find them, but that’s missing from the game. Perhaps I’m just being too picky here though.

[b]Is it a rip-off?[/b]
Note, this is not a rip-off of Pokémon. It is also not ""Pokémon with guns"". This is essentially a rip-off of ARK, with Pokémonish creatures instead of dinosaurs. If you didn't like ARK, you will not like this game.
Personally, I don't care if it's extremely similar to ARK. Basically every game that comes out is similar to something else; there's no way around this. Did they copy some Pokémon ideas? Almost certainly yes, however, there's like a thousand Pokémon, so it's kind of hard ""not"" to at this point (there's a literal bag of trash Pokémon after all).
The whole court case thing is actually a massive problem for the gaming industry. Regardless of what you think of Palworld stealing from Pokémon, if Nintendo proves that you can patent just about anything, and stop other developers from making enjoyable games, this will create a monopoly situation. This will hurt video game development for decades to come. Another good example of this is how Shadow or Mordor/War created the amazing nemesis system, but now NO ONE is ever allowed to ever have this in their game, with it being literally decades until people are allowed to again. This ruins creativity and possibilities for game devs. I understand wanting to protect your intellectual property, but we’ve gone way past that in this case. Game devs should be allowed to do what they want, use whatever ideas they want, to make the game they want to make (aside from just flat out stealing code).

[b]Should I buy?[/b]
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever. That said, it is an open world survival type game. If you don’t like that, then you won’t like this. This is not at all similar to the Pokémon games’ gameplay, so keep that in mind. There’s a lot of base building/management to do if you want to succeed. But, if you like that, then this is an absolute must have game.",True,1,0
"[h1]Palworld – Cute Pals, Questionable Ethics, and Total Mayhem[/h1]

""Palworld"" is like Pokémon took a detour through a dystopian survival game and came out with a serious case of dark humor. You collect adorable Pals, but things go off the rails fast when you realize those fluffy friends can be used for everything—from running your sweatshop to acting as your personal meat shield in battle. Oh, and anything inside a Pal Ball? Yeah, technically a ""Pal,"" even humans. Let the chaos begin. 😈🎯

[h2]Pros:[/h2]

Pals are adorable... until you start using them as mobile power plants or cannon fodder. 🐾🔫
A wild variety of gameplay: farming, fighting, factory work, or just casually shooting at your own Pals for fun. 🌾💼💥
Dark humor everywhere—like when you realize you can “accidentally” shoot a Pal (or a ""Pal"" that's suspiciously human) and still sleep at night. 🤷‍♂️😬
I’m having an absolute blast with all the chaos. It’s weird, wild, and totally addictive! 🎉🔥

[h2]Cons:[/h2]

Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of all the mayhem. Is that a farm or a battlefield? Who knows anymore. 😵‍💫


If you love cute creatures, dark humor, and the occasional ""oops, I just shot my Pal,"" then ""Palworld"" is the game for you. It’s not just about collecting Pals—it’s about seeing how far you can push the moral envelope while laughing at the absurdity. I’m having way too much fun with it. 😏💣",True,5,2

The game really sucked me in, I played nonstop, just wanting to catch more Pals, build bigger bases, and explore every part of the map.

That said, the game still needs work, there’s no real story to tie everything together, and the balancing can feel off at times. Some Pals and weapons feel way too strong, while others feel useless.

"This game is fantastic, better than Ark survival and Pokemon.
Very possible to get 100%  of achievements.
Huge open map with a ton of creatures to capture and battle.
Crafting things does take quite a lot of time though.
Much more fun with friends too, though overseas friends will experience connection lag with push and pull.

Sleeping pals are easy to capture since campfire damage is a thing.

"the love put into this game is incredibly apparent and shows what a monster catching game could be like. while i admit, a COUPLE of the designs of the initial release were uninspired and blatant copies of some pokemon, there are so many more unique and creative ones, or ones that take inspiration and uniquely improve upon the design (e.g orserk v garchomp, imo orserk is way cooler). With the latest sakurajima and especially feybreak updates, every pal in that got added is unique in design from any pokemon, and goes to show the creativity the devs have and the love for this game they are putting in. this all goes without mentioning all the fun gameplay things they add, ranging from things that casual players can enjoy such as exploration and finding new pals, to things that hardcore players can put hours and hours into.

"Not a bad game but gets boring really fast with how grindy it gets and with dull combat, also I don't understand how people compare this to pokemon gameplay wise since they play nothing alike, which I don't really get what people think is innovative about this since its basically just ark but somewhat better",False,0,0

"Actually a very fun survival game.
Its like Ark survival but without the need to senselessly sink vast amounts of time into it.
It's also a bit like Pokemon/Digimon but with more robust gameplay systems in place.
A survival game where base building is fun and tasks can be automated utilising an army of Pal slaves.

You can capture humans XD",True,0,0
What we wished the modern poke master games were. Works on the Steam deck and has very customizable settings that can be changed to reduce the grinding if you don't want to bother with it. Skyrim meets Ark with pals. Soloer friendly,True,0,0

"It's a really forgiving 'survival' game even at normal settings resources and progress have a steady pace up till you get to intermediate to advanced tech. Building bases could use a bit of improvement and more parts (like half walls,railings, etc.)  but it's a lot of fun for what doesn't need to be a huge time investment.

I had my first base feeling self sufficient in the first day of play, and now at 20 hours in I'm well into my second base building a completely unnecessary fortress(when I should be progressing) just because I have the resources to spare and I can. I expected it to take much longer to get to the point I could just build things for fun. Especially after having played games like ARK.

My only disappointment so far is the lack of interaction with the factions and characters in game. Even the boss battles are just intro scene and then you fight with no words or explanation whatsoever that's a bit weird to me.

TLDR: If you want a low stress 'survival' sandbox to fool around in this is a safe bet. Though if you're looking for plot or interesting characters to interact with this ain't it. Lore isn't that deep here.",True,0,0

"Only 7 hours in and I can't stop playing. It's 2.19 AM and I have blood tests to do at 9.00 AM lol. I haven't sunk into a game like this in a long time. I have to go to bed :P But I'm looking forward to jumping on tomorrow. 

I picked this game up for $32.96 AUD and it's worth every cent. Kudos to the developers, I'm not an easy person to please when it comes to video games. I'm loving the Penguin pal, I take him every where when I go to slaughter everything.

I'm sure I'll have some later feedback, like the timer on food that can be reset by just clicking the sort button. But that's trivial. I can handle small things like that. Other than that, the game runs really well. The game has Zelda vibes, but with building / tower defence / pokemon / minecraft / World of Warcraft. That's my take on it. 

Anyway, wish me luck for my blood tests, hopefully my arm doesn't fall off.",True,0,0

"This game has been everything I had hoped for! I'm determined to get this game to full completion in every way imaginable. The base building is fantastic I love the mechanics of building a base in this game with all of it's functions. One thing I find quite annoying is that if I log off and come back on the next day all of my pals at base are in critical condition with all sorts of sicknesses and low SAN, to solve this I just drop them on their own page in the pal box before I log out and take them all out every time I log in. The range of pals is pretty neat and I'm kinda sucked in to wanting to catch every single one of them. This game is so in depth with the pal perks and stats you really have the possibility to create your dream team pal arsenal! I love the game so much I went ahead and got 6 months server time for my own server I'm currently level 54 and still have SO much to learn about this game and that is a very good thing! This has been a game I want to play and play.. and play. :D. If you haven't picked up this game yet I'm telling you - you have NOTHING to loose! This game has been a 10/10 on a scale of enjoyment for me highly recommend!",True,0,0
First played on Xbox through gamepass Just bought it again on PC. A lot of new changes since I last played. Lot of cute and cool pals. My favorite thing about this game is that how grindy the game can be  is 100% up to how you play and you can even change it in the settings. Pal designs are great I wish they would come out with plushies. Really cozy survival game.,True,0,0
A fun base building monster tamer style game.  A lot of potential and can't wait for the full release,True,0,0
"This should be the new standard for an Early Access games. 

I don´t really have anything to complain about, it feels like a complete and very well made game.
Only pointers: 
- More pals
- Better technology tree (Or system) 
- Job priorities (Like in Rimworld) 
- Job commands for crafting stations (Like in Rimworld - ´Slaughter animal - Infinite´ - would be nice for spheres) 
- Make transport more powerful - double if not triple it´s effect.
- Make pals able to empty workcamps (Stone pit, Logging site etc.) 

It isn´t a fantastic co-op game since paldium is used for Pal spheres which can be quite the hastle for two people to share early in the game.

"It fills a very niche gaming desire for me. It is a fun game overall but I feel progress slows down in the mid to late game where it gets a little too tedious and grindy even with the settings adjusted. The “legally distinct pals” are cool but some definitely are just rip offs which is a little disappointing. Fun game but wish they actually put more effort into the pal designs.

"This game has a wonderful mix of adorable creatures, building, combat and exploration. It's not perfect. The constant need for food is annoying. The building glitches are annoying.

"솔직히 이 게임 몇년 전에 트레일러 처음 나왔을 때만 해도
""대체 시벌 뭔 게임이야 이게...?"" 싶었었고
발매 전까지 진짜로 나올줄 몰랐는데

생각보다 재밌는 게임입니다.
근데 너무 기대하면 게임의 하자가 조금씩 보입니다.

게임의 기획이나 그런 부분의 하자가 아니라
버그 같은 성능 문제의 하자 말이죠.

포켓몬 같은 게임을 원하시면 이건 대체제가 되진 못하고
아크 같은 게임을 원하시면 훌륭한 대체제가 될겁니다.

마침 이 게임이랑 아크 둘다 성능에 하자가 있다는 공통점도 있네요.
최적화 개등신 같고 변경점도 없는 1.5 버전이나 내놓고 24년도에 내놓는다던 2도 무기한 연기한 아크 하지 마시고

"No doubt like many others, I got this game basically just to point and laugh at the pokemon rip off. I could not have been more wrong about this game. This game is what pokemon should be. I have been hoping that pokemon would do something like this for over a decade. Legends Arceus being the closest thing. There are certainly some designs that are blatant rip offs of pokemon, but from what I have seen thus far, there are significantly fewer of those than I was lead to believe. As a survival game, this game is fantastic. It is incredibly immersive to live in tandem with the pals, working and fighting alongside them. Seeing them all walk around and exist in their respective habitats is fascinating. I am surprised that it took this long for something like this to come along. Fighting alongside your pals while dodging enemy attacks is incredibly engaging. The map is absolutely enormous and filled with interesting things to find, like chests, dungeons, upgrades, and most importantly, new pals. The progression is vast and it feels like each level up is actually meaningful in terms of tech for your base and weapons for taking on stronger enemies. My biggest complaints about the game revolve around bugs and general stability. I can often play without issue for extended periods, but when a bug does happen, it can be game breaking, like falling through the map, or pals being stuck in place and not being able to do anything. These bugs hopefully will be ironed out in due time. All that said, I am extremely excited to see where this game goes in the future. To anyone on the fence about picking this game up, or to anyone who still thinks this is a rip off of pokemon, I strongly urge you to give this game a try, I honestly wish I had given it a chance sooner.",True,0,0

"It's a very good monster collector/battler. As someone intimate with the genre, I couldn't be happier with the breeding system, and the various ways to improve pals (Skill fruit, Elixers, etc.). The true signal of a good monster raising game is the ability to beat even the hardest bosses with your favorites, and PocketPair made that possible. Of course some pals will be better than others out of the box, but with some real dedication you can have a Lamball much more powerful than any Jetragon.

Usually I hate open world games but Palworld makes exploring very fun with various mounts and tech for getting around fast.

The game was super buggy on launch but the devs are really devoted to fixing the problems and adding real, tangible content. They've added new Pals here and there, new bosses, and even an entirely new area. 

Overall the game's a steal. Its easy to invest a lot of time just into the Pals. I'd highly recommend it.",True,0,0
