Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,"finished with my girlfriend. during the game, we fought, argued and sometimes we even hit each other, but in the end it strengthened our bonding and we had fun time."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"i really enjoyed this one, nothing bad to say about. must play. like previous game a way out perfect for couples or friends to play. tho i wish there was way to increase difficulty."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-08,"josef fares is the goat with these kinds of games. loved brothers, loved a way out and this def deserved goty"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-08,awesome!! it is a wonderful game to enjoy with your significant other or friends.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-07,"i know about this game from a youtuber i follow who played it. with its jumpy gameplay and splitscreen play between two players, i was really interested in the game and decided to skip the clips and buy the game myself. i was impressed by the friends pass system, where even if only one person has the game, they can play together online. only thing you need to do is just invite your friend to the game and let them download it. the first thing that i need to praise is the gameplay. there are a lot of play modes in this game. even though the core mechanic of this game is to solve the puzzles and jump around to avoid all obstacles in the map, they still mix other kinds of gameplay in their gameplay. you will see many things that you ever play like shooting or fighting like street fighter. the puzzles are a lot of variety. they have a lot of equipment that allows you to solve puzzles. you need to work together with your friend to pass through various levels, so teamwork is very important in this game. with this game's camera angle, it makes the game even more fun. they have various camera angles in this game, they have been used very appropriately in every situation, making the story flow smoothly in every gameplay and cutscene. the highlight of this game is the split screen into two sides for both players, allowing both players to see each other's mistakes, leading to conflicts that add more fun to the game. another thing that i've always admired about this studio's games is the minigames. i have played a way out from this studio before, there is one house that is full of mini games to play. this game is the same. there are mini games hidden in each level and still have the very good quality as the main gameplay. for the story of this game. it starts with a couple with one child who is about to get a divorce. the daughter who knows about it feels bad and very sad until she finds a book that says it will help people fall in love again. she asks for a blessing from the book, which turns codey and may, rose's parents, into wooden and cloth dolls. the two of them must find a way to return to normal form. along the way, they will talk and understand each other more from the things in the house and the tests they have to face. after i play this game. the story is very long and i enjoy the journey of the two characters so much. the graphics, gameplay, story, everything is perfect. 1010"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-09-26,it was a joy to play through with my kid. long enough and a very good game to do some team building!
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-09-25,what a game! this game was just great. impressive story and endless action.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-05-27,"first, despite being designed for coop play, it took at least a half hour of finagling to even get the game to recognize two separate controllers on the same pc despite steam's excellent controller support being readily available. we later found that these issues and finagling have to be repeated every time the game is started, leading to additional frustration when attempting to pick up the game again at a later date. after we finally got the game running, it turns out the graphics setting detection is nonexistent, leaving us with intermittent lag issues that made gameplay extremely frustrating. the characters and concepts had been done in quite a few games before this one, so the game itself wasn't compelling enough to keep us interested in getting past the technical issues, leaving us just feeling frustrated. honestly one of the worst coop experiences i've had."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-04-18,highly recommended for every couple. it will test your relationship and will give you moments to remember
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-03-20,"one of the greatest coop games i've ever played. the story may not appeal to everyone, but the gameplay is quite enjoyable."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-03-02,the first two to three levels of the game were fun but after that the game became atrocious.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-02-29,me and my girl just finished the game and it was a blast! took around 32 hours to complete. hoping for a sequel cuz we didnt get enough.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-02-08,a great coop game that has some really fun tools to play with through the adventure. each person is usually doing something different so if you wanted you could play through again and switch characters. some of the story elements are pretty dumb though and the parents are both very unlikeable.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2024-02-03,the game started of well but got boring fast. the gameplay was ok but the bosses were to easy and the game got very repetitive. i didnt finish the game beause it got very boring.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-11-16,"a wonderful game, i played it with a friend in 3 days, its very beautiful, thanks to the unreal engine it looks magical, i was amazed by the variety of ideas in each location, thanks to the developers for this wonderful journey, it was a lot of fun."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-11-05,"the best coop game i ever played, period"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-10-28,"arguably the best game i've ever played. story was fun, music was great, graphics were absolutely stunning outside of the uncanny human models, gameplay was incredibly solid, and concepts were phenomenal. this is a game everyone should play with their partner, seated next to eachother. this game features combat, stealth, rhythm, street fighter, puzzles, shooter, racing, platforming, and everything inbetween. the amount of times i'd gotten chills playing this with my partner is immense, i wish i could go back and play it for the first time once again. i believe this is the most polished, and beautifully intimate couchcoop game to date, and an absolute mustplay for anyone in a relationship."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-10-22,me n my bro really had a memorable time on dis 4 sure
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-09-07,"the.  book. jokes aside, this game was really great. after playing 'a way out' though the game is just not as good."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-08-18,very good game. i enjoyed playing this game a lot. i strongly recommend this.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-08-05,"it takes two winning game of the year was no surprise, its a masterpiece through and through. the creativity in every level is just unreal, making every moment feel fresh and exciting. playing it with my girlfriend was an incredible experience, and the way it forces you to truly work together makes the title so fitting. visually stunning, packed with variety, and an absolute joy to play, this is coop perfection. if youre even thinking about playing it, just do it. you wont regret it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-07-28,"great section design, lots of gameplay variety, nonstop pace and the pleasure of playing with a friend but basic and not intresting story."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-07-14,"this is most likely the best game ever. so full of surprises, varying mechanics and a general feeling of whoooa it's a delight."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-07-01,an exciting game of 2... if you play it with your partner it will be a nice memory for a lifetime...
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-07-01,"this game is so good holy  everyone should try this with a friend is so fun, the level design is incredible, the presentation is nice, the mnigames are so fun i wanted to find every single one of them. the story is nice its like disney movie type of story but nothing too special, it does fit in the game really well tho."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-06-01,"this is the pinnacle of modern aaa coop games. it's pretty, funny, challenging, and everything else you wanted from a game like this. every aspect of this game is perfect, the scenery in each level is beautiful, the story and characters are very fun and the biggest positive from me at least, is how they always give you new mechanics to mess around with, which makes the gameplay very fresh and entertaining. i would say this is an incredible choice to introduce gaming to a nongamer, especially a loved one."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-05-31,"it took me back to my childhood, and every discovery in this game was full of surprises. i only felt that i hadn't felt such pure joy in a long time 1010"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-05-23,"it takes two, developed by hazelight studios, is a delightful coop adventure that takes players on a whimsical journey through a world of magic and imagination. with its innovative gameplay mechanics, charming characters, and heartfelt storytelling, the game offers a unique cooperative experience that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant. one of the standout features of it takes two is its innovative gameplay design. the game requires two players to work together in seamless cooperation to progress through the levels and overcome obstacles. the variety of gameplay mechanics and puzzles is impressive, ranging from platforming challenges to inventive minigames. the constant need for communication and coordination between players fosters a sense of teamwork and creates memorable moments of collaboration. the game's imaginative world is beautifully realized, with stunning visuals and a whimsical art style that exudes charm. each level introduces new environments and mechanics, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging. from navigating a magical tree to exploring a treacherous toy world, the game constantly surprises and delights with its creative design and attention to detail. it takes two shines in its characterization and storytelling. the protagonists, cody and may, are a couple on the verge of divorce who find themselves transformed into dolls within a fantastical world. the story explores themes of love, forgiveness, and the complexities of relationships, with emotional depth and nuance. the witty and wellwritten dialogue, combined with strong voice acting performances, brings the characters to life and enhances the emotional impact of the narrative. the game's pacing is wellexecuted, with a good balance between lighthearted moments and more introspective, emotional sequences. it successfully combines humorous and whimsical elements with poignant storytelling, creating a narrative that resonates with players on a personal level. it takes two's soundtrack deserves special mention, as it perfectly complements the game's tone and enhances the overall experience. the music captures the emotions of each scene, from playful tunes during lighthearted moments to poignant melodies during more emotional sequences. the score adds depth and immersion to the game, enhancing the storytelling and atmosphere. while it takes two offers a truly remarkable cooperative experience, it does have a few minor shortcomings. some of the gameplay mechanics, while innovative, can occasionally feel repetitive or overly complicated, requiring precise coordination and timing between players. additionally, the game's reliance on coop play may limit its accessibility for players without a dedicated partner, as it does not offer a viable singleplayer option. overall, it takes two is a heartwarming and engaging coop adventure that excels in its unique gameplay mechanics, beautiful visuals, and heartfelt storytelling. the game's emphasis on teamwork and cooperation, along with its memorable characters and emotional narrative, make it a standout experience in the coop genre. while it may have a few minor flaws, the overall package is a testament to hazelight studios' creativity and ability to craft a game that is both entertaining and meaningful."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-05-23,"a masterpiece. artstyle is amazing. the level design is beyond incredible. the coop experience is fantastic. the game keeps giving you new equipment at each level, which makes dynamic gameplay, killing off any repetition. every part of this game was pure joy. the minigames and other details within levels are blessings. i never got bored playing this game, not even for a second. i could not expect anything more than a coop actionadventure platform game. i'm breaking a point because hakim was very annoying. also, the relationship dynamic was unrealistic and too comical at some points. but at this point i'm trying too hard trying to find a con about this game."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-04-21,"amazing game, especially to play with couple, but you can play with any friend."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-03-27,"fun gameplay, rich in variety but filled with woke references. i don't need fking game devs trying to shove their political agendas down my throat."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-02-09,graphics 9.5 gameplay 9.5 sounds 9 chapter desing 9 story 8 overrall 9
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-01-28,"probably one of the best coop games ever made. due to the game's there, playing with your so might be better."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-01-24,this it the best game i ever  best friend haluk and i played it and what can i say its awesome.there are frogs squriells and  men in this game. and the most important magic fire sword and the ice magic 5645634675243610
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-12-19,"best coop game ever! i would like to recommend it for every couple!  the graphics, controls, frame rate were perfect, the story is cute!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-12-11,"another excellent coop story game with morals from ea is different from a way out which had action as zonor, this one focuses on fun elements similar to a toy story movie."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-11-19,"this is by far the best coop game of all time. the level design is incredible. everything is designed into the last little detail. you really can see how much love the developers put in this game. pretty unusual for ea. the environment is changing in around 30 minutes, so you can't get bored. the mechanics are incredible as well. every new enviroment gives you fun new tools to work with. each of them is totally different. also the multiplayer aspect of the game is the best i've ever seen. just like the name is says you cant move on without your partner. also the story is simple but well made. more unusual for ea is that you have to buy this game just once, to play it online with your friend. you just need to invite him trough the friend pass. i recommend this game to everyone who has at least one friend. if you have none, try to get some and play this game it is absolutely worth it. 100100"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-11-18,"it takes two takes criativity and elevates and puts it in another level, the beautiful graphics, the cinematics, the good characters, the funny history, the mechanics, the variety of gameplay its out of this world, few games have this. the fact you can just play with another it might be a bad thing, but it's not, on the contrary, its more funnier to play this game with two, and this is the word, collaboration!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-11-16,"unfortunately this game breaks constantly because the publisher, ea forces their launcher on you. its probably good but most people will just get frustrated with the ea launcher, which constantly changes to new launchers and breaks all the time."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-09-09,story is not the best i will admit but this game offers something that no game has offered. best coop experience
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-09-01,good  excellent level design  great story  high variety and fun minigame  worth repeating  amazing visual effect  wonderful ost and voice acting  unique coop experience bad  na
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-08-25,"really enjoyed playing this through with my partner. thought it would be quite juvenile, childish but the themes and some parts of the story defintiely felt like we were the target audience and not kids. plenty of fun silly minigames to try, although each one wasn't very complex so i don't feel the need to return to them much. i will probably play this game through again at some point in the future."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-07-14,"get a buddy, get a few drinks, sit on the couch or from your own homes and play this game together. it's fun, unique and interesting."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-06-29,"it takes two and consists of a sequence of different stages where you and your partner have to solve many challenges to progress through the game. in each stage, a new mechanic is introduced, which in theory prevents the gameplay from becoming stale. however, not all mechanics are created equally, with some just being there to fill time. in addition, for a lot of stages, the game does a lot of handholding, and overall, the game never really provides a hard challenge. the story starts good, but later on, it only serves to make up new rules and poor excuses to extend the length of a stagegame. on a more positive note, the game has many fun minigames that allow you to compete against your partner. overall, it takes two has a lot of fun parts, but despite only being only 1015 hours long, it feels like it drags on forever."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-06-17,score 8.6 very good game just like a way out even playing with a friend is soo  fun
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-06-17,"it's hard to score this game. one one hand, it is probably the best 3d cooperative game ever made, and on the other, it is heavily flawed. the variety, and two player gameplay are excellent and fun, no complaints there whatsoever. the nods to different playstyles are especially fun, and there are times when the game blows my mind, especially vehicle segments. the people who made the game seem to have a certain understanding for balancing play design. the minigames vary from just ok to excellent, and in general this is probably top two coop experiences of all time. from a different perspective, the writing is absolutely awful, and the voice acting is bad, especially rose, who is clearly voiced by an adult, and is extremely creepy. i would actually go so far as to say, the decision to cast rose as an adult completely ruins any sort of emotional weight the game may otherwise have had. my girlfriend and i usually just laugh at the creepy rose parts especially after i played her what it reminded me of blue jam, series 3, episode four, about 815. the writing is awful. the book is a weird mexican? stereotype, its not amusing at all, and just makes us roll our eyes and skip the cutscenes. there are also really lame jokes, including really hacky fart jokes, that seem more aimed at little kids, which is weird because this game really does not seem like a good game for kids in most regards. the world is also weirdly sparse, i really hate that every 3d platformer has become a collectathon, but it seems like there should be some things to find, or some small quests. can't recommend it enough as a play experience though despite it's flaws."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-06-09,terrible writing torpedoes what would have been an otherwise acceptable cooperate game. the parents are so awful they make me want to call cps.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-04-27,my truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game 10.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-04-26,wonderful world! unforgettable impressions of the cooperative. best time for spend a few evenings with your friends.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-02-19,"it takes two is probably the best storybased coop game so far. the experience is truly unforgettable, way better if you experience it with the right person by the way i recommend playing it with the right person. but. yes, there's always a but if you're not rdr2. despite the fact that it takes two doesn't promise you a mindblowing story, it lacks the motivation to keep playing the game for the story this part is important because i'll bring this up again, don't get me wrong the story is sweet and all but i'm not much of a person for sweet little stories to tell your grandchildren. it's just a standard one, don't expect much out of it. anyway, let's move on to the part where the fun begins. a few sentences earlier i stated that the game lacks the motivation on the story, however it has all the motivation you need to keep playing thanks to the unique gameplay and mechanics the game holds in it except for a few parts which can be overlooked. the diversity and the opportunities in every chapter can make you fall for this game. for instance, the one where you become a thor like character and throw nails around. oh! you don't like thor? okay, maybe a part where you become something of a captain america yourself and just play fetch with your shield. maybe you can pretend you're the late wonderful edith piaf and sing your way out of the level or you can play as a wizard and a knight in a mmorpg alike sequence. not even mentioning the extremely fun minigames spread across the chapters i insist on you to play the baseball one. it's not quite usual that we see a game with this much variation in gameplay. as you can see there are a lot of things you can and probably will do in this game. so, go on and get your buddy or your girlfriend or whoever you'd like, hop on to it takes two and enjoy! 810, recommended if you'd like to play something different and taste some new tastes in terms of game mechanics."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-02-14,"so overrated !! the controls are just so bad, so clunky and the camera so annoying. puzzles are too easy, no challenge except for the bosses and trying to jump with these weird controls. i've played hundreds of games and i just don't get it. the rest is not that bad and if the controls and camera were not that bad, it would not be a great game but not a bad game either."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-02-05,"not bad at all, varied and fun games played out in some very pretty environments. fun to play with one of your kids or fun for two kids to play together. drags on though. the first 4 hours, great, and after that, can we be done yet please? but uh, the voice acting, my god. the two main characters are so irritating, and their voices are horrible."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-02-04,"it is a very fun game to play, especially for couples. me and my girlfriend have a great time playing it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-25,best coop game i have ever played plus it's free on game pass so i 100 recommend 1010
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-23,"so much work must've went into this... great game, stunning environment and scenery, non stop action and interaction with the other person, so many different types of gameplay in each section, given the different powers you're handled. good job"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-22,"simply a masterpiece! fun, varied and exciting gameplay, the game never lets you get bored. a very beautiful story, with characters that are built throughout the narrative. my wife and i came to cry at the end of so much emotion. congratulations to the idealized of this beautiful game."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-16,"truly amazing game. i played it with my cousin and i absolutely loved it. the story is great and have a great message, but above all is the great variety of gameplay and how much fun is each one of them. it's really an unique experience."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-15,"this game simply brings fresh ideas and new emotions! a musthave for everyone. cool visuals, nice sound design, stunning level design, and wellthought mechanics. the only drawbacks are a bit crumpled end of the game and a little poor server optimization for online coop."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-12,"awesome game, my girlfriend and i really enjoyed it! it's a pity that such games are rare now."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-09,this coop game aligns its gameplay really well with the story to make the experience truly collaborative for the two players. some of the levels were downright incredible to play and solve. only slight negatives are that the story isn't groundbreaking and some levels feel like they just overstay their welcome.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-09,"really love this, fantastic quality product. ea can indeed make great games sometimes!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-05,"great game, great story, every moment is very enjoyable, great visuals. one problem with it is that not all controllers are detected in local coop so we could only play online with a friend pass. they doesn't mention in advance that you can't coop on one keyboard."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-04,"possibly the best coop experience you might get, so much diversity and the story is pretty amazing too, recommend playing this with your best buddy!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2022-01-04,"best coop story game, if you have friends play that . i really like the story and how the characters are written and the gameplay is also very varied and doesnt get boring."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-10-28,"in a world of overpriced, creatively lacking, morally bankrupt gaming, it takes two does everything right. they managed to fit so many ideas into a relatively small game, but they also managed to do each and every idea to a great standard. i think the studio really learned from a way out as to what does and doesn't work in this type of game. this game features far more variety in its gameplay and minigames, a more compelling story, and so much creativity. it never felt like too long was spent on any one section for it to get boring. this is the best game i've played in a good few years, and is by far the best coop game experience i've ever had, and for what is just over half the price of the new 'aaa' standard, its an absolute no brainer if you have someone to play it with and they can play with you for free!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-10-17,"one of the best games i've ever played in my life. definitely the best coop game ever made. surprisingly lengthy, the mechanics are epicly fun, clever, diverse and satisfying. graphics, design, soundtrack, voice acting  everything in this game is perfect. me and my girlfriend had been wishing it to never end. hands down to hazelight and everyone involved for creating such masterpiece."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-10-07,"a wonderful game that can grab us at every moment. fantastic gameplay and scenery variations. the book is very charismatic, a very good character! the two main characters are great too, and are involved in a good story! when the game says it has to be played in coop, it's really true because at every moment you're in need of your partner to be able to advance in the scenario, which makes the game a true masterpiece!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-10-04,"another coop game from hazelight, and another masterpiece! it takes two has every necessary factor that a great game must have graphics, story, challenging levels, and great level design. the 15hourslong journey was incredibly fun and spectacular. minigames were also fun to play. however the most disappointing part for me was the ending, because the game didn't really show me the reunion of cody and may the way i wanted to see, it was more like they came together because of their daughter and all that collaboration was for nothing. despite disappointing ending, it takes two was an amazing and fun game for me and it's definitely one of my favorite games. september  october 2021"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-09-21,it takes two is just a good game. but this is the best game for two i've ever played. quite a banal and blurry ending. but this is probably the only drawback of the game. my wife and i were delighted.

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-08-20,gameplay is really funny and varied. played with my 8 year old daughter i enjoyed as a child. arts are superb ! best cooperative game i have ever enjoyed in my life.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-08-17,"horrible storytelling, just bad writing disguised as dark humor that makes no sense for this type of game. if you think this is funny you are just a bad human being. the game play is amazing, however the terrible writing makes the game unplayable."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-08-01,"easily one of the best, if not the best coop experiences on pc. i really loved the variety of gameplay. never a dull moment. the writing for the characters was on the level of a romcom hollywood movie. very impressive. highly recommended. it deserves a much higher score than what you're seeing here."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-07-03,"it takes two is a coop 3d puzzleplatformer game with a great variety of gameplay over the 14 or so hours it takes to complete it. you play as one of two members of a married couple who are getting a divorce, but a magical book of love intervenes, trying to force the two back together. as such, the entire game revolves around cooperative problem solving in a fantastical shrunkendown environment. the core cooperative gameplay of this game is quite decent. it is a 3d puzzle platformer at its core, with the main goal being to overcome various challenges to reach a destination, rather than exploration. the game is entirely linear, but it takes the player through a wide variety of environments, and does a good job of mixing things up. the main gimmick of the game is that you gain powers in each area of the game. in one area, one player might have a nail, and another a hammer head this can be used to both nail stuff down, as well as to swing around from the nails using the hammer for the purposes of traversal. in another area, the characters are given silly guns by squirrels to go fight wasps, with one shooting globs of sap and the other being able to light them on fire and make them explode. still later, you gain powers like the ability to shrink or grow, or walk on walls, or various other things. all of these are used to solve various environmental puzzles, usually revolving around traversal, but sometimes trying to make things line up or break something or accomplish some other task. these tasks vary considerably, and the game avoids repeating too much by changing up the gameplay not just between levels, but oftentimes within levels as well. this is a game that is afraid of the audience getting bored, and it generally does a good job of avoiding it while a couple levels do linger a bit too long, generally speaking, it does keep things fresh. the fact that the players must work together constantly works really well this isnt a game where one player can just solve everything, both players have to work together to get stuff done. its a great coop game, and can be played both online and side by side. interestingly, regardless of which way you play it, it is always played in split screen mode  the reason being that it is often necessary to see what your partner is doing, and often helpful for helping each other figure things out. best of all, you dont even both have to own the game to play it! only one player actually needs to buy the game the other player can join in via the friends pass version of the game, which makes it pretty ideal for sharing it with another person. if there is a complaint about the core gameplay, it is that while it mixes things up a fair bit, it is never really that great. it is always decent to good, but it never really reaches the point of greatness. on the flipside, however, the plot and story are rather weak. the protagonists actually have a good reason to split up, but their daughter doesnt understand what is going on and is upset by it. the book is basically a product of their daughters distress, but unfortunately, it ends up not working out very well storywise, as while the problems the characters have are brought up, they are never actually addressed. this is a huge lost opportunity, as while each area is supposedly addressing some sort of issue they have, none of these areas actually address the issue  playing inside a cuckoo clock is a cute way to represent that they never have enough time for each other or for doing the things they want to do, but the actual story never actually presents any sort of solution for the fact that one of the characters is working too much to spend any time with the family, while the other resents the lack of time they have with them and frankly, does a rather poor job of being a househusband. the problem is that the game sort of acts like there is some sort of progress here, even though none of it makes much sense as a means of actually overcoming their real issues with each other. i would have liked for the game to either resolve the issues in some way, or at least present a potential solution, or else have the characters be like none of this has anything to do with actually solving our problems! and have it all end with them being like nope, were getting divorced anyway. the ending of the game isnt particularly good or earned, and while it is a bit ambiguous, its not all that great. in all fairness to the writing, though, while the overall plot is lousy, the actual dialogue and situations are often amusing, and there are definitely some funny lines. still, this is not a game to be played for its story."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-04-06,"some people may dislike the fact that you need a friend to play the game with but that is actually the reason why this game is so great. there are so many great single player games like the witcher 3, red dead redemption 2 or botw. the last time i had so much fun playing a multiplayer game was with portal 2. it takes two has so much to offer because in every chapter there is something new to experience. the diversity of weapons and how to use them is great. i did not feel bored once through the whole game while getting entertained by the book of love and the jokes cody and may made about each other. it is a true romantic comedy and the exact thing you need if you loved the good old days of couch coop and having fun together with your actual friends and family. this game is an absolute multiplayerstory masterpiece and even though it is more focused on the brilliant mechanics and gameplay the visuals look great too and the game is running smoothly. i would definitely recommend using a controller for this game because the aim assistance is well integrated and it just feels better but if you feel like preferring a keyboard you can still easily go for it. the most important thing about this game is the psychological flow. you always feel challenged but not overwhelmed because of the good balanced difficulty."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-04-02,"it takes two to make a thing go right it takes towo is a 12 hour long co op based puzzle platforming game and this is the best co op gave ive ever played in my life. here you play as either may or cody this game does require you play with two people either online or locally, i played locally with my girlfriend, she was may, i was cody your daughter is sad the two of you are getting divorced, the classic magic tears happen and next thing you know, the both of you wake up in the bodies of these 2 dolls,and you have a spansish love doctor in the form of the book of love there to help you find love again, all while the two of you are trying to break the spell and get back in your bodies. the levels area variety of puzzles, and its that variety that makes it takes two such an amazing game, as again this game is 12 hours long, variety is an absolute necessity.. and because of that, each level here almost feels like a new puzzle game itself each time youre given a new ability or weapon for that level specifically, which also makes this game so accessible, theres no need to remember every tool or control the game throws at you, as every hour or 2, you throw that item away for a new one, and i loved that..i loved knowing that if im not liking the gameplay of a particular section, that if i just puh through, ill be given a new fresh style of gameplay and not have to deal with it anymore.. and hey.. if you are playing locally and you like one persons ability more than the others, you could just switch characters if theyre willing.. i personally played as cody the whole time the game does do a great job at switching who gets th better ability though i feel mostly cody is stuck with the here, let me move this or hold this while you have all the fun platforming i felt like the cogs inside of a platforming level quite a few times while playing an interesting idea that im sure would be a pain development wise, is the ability to chose who gets what before a level starts or the ability to switch items as the level goes on.. either to switch things up for each player, or for moments of strengths and weaknesses to play out in the actual people playing it wasnt that big of a deal having your ability already pre chosen based on the character you are.. but the choice wouldve been nice.. overall though i absolutely love it takes two.. you get a touching story, gameplay variety that revels the likes of a mario game, and one the most if no the most amazing co op experience in gaming history it has its moments of this just isnt fun, and i wouldve like more action sequenes thrown in there than we got, just to break up the puzzle solving more but it takes two is near masterpiece status, and is a must play for you and that other person in your life i give it takes two a 9.510"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-04-01,this is how the game should look like. shame to all tripple a studios with their gamelike crap.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-30,"it takes two is a rare feature. it is for those who have been playing games for a long time, and at the same time  for those who have never done this, but really want to join. she is also funny, with many references to films that are understandable."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-29,"as other mentioned... first 15 minutes of the game is something you just have to endure. but then, oh boy... i will risk saying this is the best coop game in history of video games. if you are in a relationship  you need to get a copy and play it with your 'better half'"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-29,"games are played, not made. don't let the cringey first cutscene fool you what lies just beyond is a 1015 hour experience of pure perfection. every game mechanic shows a seriously deep level of polish. the writing and voiceacting is lighthearted and selfaware. most importantly, this game delivers coop fun on an unrivaled scale. frankly, it puts nintendo's more recent coop experiences to shame and i love nintendo!. if you're a fan of games like portal 2 or mario odyssey, get ready to laugh, cry and grin ear to ear for the next 15 hours! . . .but in all seriousness, pixar, have you thought about dabbling in game development? i have the team for you. . ."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-29,"i had already enjoyed a way out, so i was really looking forward to it takes two. and i was not disappointed at all! the game is super fun in coop and the story and level design are really good. i can recommend this game to anyone who wants to play one of the best coop games and has already enjoyed other hazelight titles."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-29,"a thoroughly enjoyable experience with a very well adjusted skill ceiling to play with either more or less seasoned coop partners. it is apparent that the devs put quite a bit of effort to design constantly refreshing game loops, some more interesting than others, but all in all, they manage to keep the pace at a high for most of the playthrough and found myself chuckling out loud many a time. atmosphere is top notch and very detail oriented, a good mix of straight up action and wholesome downtime. the game offers the possibility to share the experience with a friend with the purchase of a single copy. the obvious downside to it all is not having friends to coop with as it is very much tailored to play in this way."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-28,the marvelous and incredible spectacle. this perfect game for kids and adults won't leave you cold or alone. 1010 overall. a mustplay game for every single atom in the universe.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-28,"wow what a masterpiece!! thank you for this excellent experience! and the best is, i can play it with my girlfriend! great job!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-28,"the game starts off a tad bit cringey at the start, but that was just the introduction. it almost immediately shows its true quality from the get go and you'd quickly understand that you're in for a fun ride with your coop partner, in fact, probably the one of the best rides of your life where linear adventure games are concerned. it takes two is packed with a lot of different gameplay mechanics, fun versus minigames, a generous variation of pretty and amusing environments, likeable characters, and a steady story pace accompanied by albeit ordinary but humorous acting. but what stands out for me is that the variety of gameplay mechanics are introduced one by one, making sure that every chapter is unique  this is one of the primary reasons why this game is so good. if you have someone to play it with, this is a heavy recommend, whether or not you like the genre at all. a hundred bucks says you're gonna enjoy it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-27,best that could have happened in 2021. every aspect is just amazing. you should play it.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-27,"this game is just wonderful, there are so many unique environments and game mechanics. the amount of assets this game has is staggering. a masterpiece coop platformer and easily a goty contender"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-27,"amazing game. i recommend it.  the story is original and funny. the characters are unique in the story yet close to reality.  the graphics are really really cool and there's a lot of different themes. sometimes you'll just think it's mindblowing. plus, the optimization is great. the only problem is about the micro freezing problems into the cinematic but not game breaking at all.  the gameplay and the puzzles are quite simple yet satisfying, with a lot of refreshing ideas, always different. you don't get the same toolspowers each hour of playing the game. i didn't get any bug. the length of the game isn't insane but still good.  the only problem is how players chose to pay for the game. it's 40 for one player and 0 for the other. quite expensive for the length, even for the good quality. even tho players can split, the free player don't get any achievements on steam at least."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2021-03-27,"if you were looking for a coop game, this is the best one. every aspect of the game is made with two players in mind and the mechanics change after every chapter so you won't get bored of doing the same thing over and over again."
