Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-31,simple but great. the game really suprised me. the graphics are minimalistic and there is no speech but the atmosphere is awesome.
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-11-06,"its not a game, its frustration simulator. at times the game gets so frustrating, some of the puzzles are ridiculous."
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-08-17,"this game definitely knows how to make a player want more you just want to keep going. playdead is one of the best companies in this style. you feel limbo's loneliness. i think his desire is not to find someone to get away from here, but mostly to find someone to not be alone anymore. he isn't afraid of dying. he doesn't know where he is or why he is here, and this fact makes him want to find someone more and  may be said that it has no story, but i can't agree with that. it just hasn't been taught fully and lets the player find and connect pieces and add a bit of their own imaginary. the game's achievements are as interesting as the game itself. some of them are easy, some of them are hard. i had so much fun while doing ding! achievement. i would definitely recommend this game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-31,"what an excellent puzzle game, with very simple horror style, but there is some puzzles that aren't clear enough, other than that its gonna be top 5 puzzle games in my opinion"
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-04-04,"a very unique, pretty, and beautiful puzzle platformer. despite its simple graphics, it's still gorgeous. the gameplay is meditative and some puzzles are quite tough which makes the game more interesting and remarkable."
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-03-15,"some game mechanics, you can figure out if you've played other games in the past. eg. duration it takes when the worm causes confusion to the boy.  puzzles are satisfying to solve, frustrating when you can't figure it out.  hollow knightlike atmosphere.  try playing another music if you're not feeling horrorish.  get prepared to say omoshiroi in your mind a number of times."
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-18,"its alright. kinda waited for more honestly. i was expecting more interaction whit the people, the ending was epic."
Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-27,"maybe not as impressive as inside, but still such a quality product with a nice plot."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-18,"this game is really interesting. the art direction is superb, and definitely fits what this game is going for. the music and sound effects also really hit the nail on the head. it's calming, but you know you don't want to be here. i also think that this is really eerie. not scary, or disturbing, but eerie. like you've walked in on the aftermath of something. the spiders are also really intriguing, and a staple of the game. it is quite difficult, and somewhat repetitive throughout, but i really love this game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-11-06,gameplay great  graphics good  story na  score na
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i can't say that i really liked the game, it clearly doesn't deserve an eight on metikritika and there are reasons for that. the game positions itself as a puzzle, but personally for me there were at most two moments that i really thought dumb. it's a weak puzzle game. the game is pretty fast, you don't have time to enjoy it. the setting of the otherworld and traveling through it didn't impress me much for some reason, i don't know why. on the plus side, despite the fact that it is a platformer and also quite casual, gameplay. for five buttons it is diverse. unusual in a good way style, and also very relaxing forest audio, i would listen to it just so. overall i think i would rate limbo a 6.5 out of 10."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-16,"if you're fun of the genre, you definitley have to try limbo, if you haven't played any game of this genre, you definitley have to start with limbo. higly recommnended"
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-16,"very short dark game, just like inside. easy to play, hard to master way too hard, if you want the 100 success. but with a deep story that is never really explained but somehow is captivating, even if gloomier as fugg."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-05,a strange and interesting game
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-25,"it's a fine platformer. this game is mostly an experience and is not so much about the gameplay or mechanics. as such, this is less my style. i didn't hate it, but i have no intention of replaying it or similar games."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-07,limbo is a puzzle game with its unique look. this game is really unforgiving so you have to be really patient and enjoy similar games to have fun. while the game is beautiful and entertaining it feels like there is no real idea behind it.
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-06,"not great overall, bored in story. but as an indie, nice job. i dont like platformpuzzle type games but visually almost perfect"
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-08-15,"i think that is an overrated game. fortunately, playdead improved a lot on inside."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-07-30,excellent platformer  puzzle solver. i was quite engaged the entire way through. i really enjoyed the environment and the darkcomedy that the game presents. highly recommended.
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-07-21,"i was so hyped before i play limbo but as soon as i started to play i realized that this game is just another overrated indie only because its art style. firstly, limbo hasn't got a story, it just has a few scenes that are trying to show a story but they doesn't make any sense together. especially the ending was just a meaningless 10 second scene. so it becomes impossible to make a connection with the game. secondly, controls are so annoying and it makes you crazy. the character doesn't jump as i wanted or he doesn't hold as i wish. it feels like i'm not controlling him, the character does whatever he wants. despite all this you can get entertained by limbo's brilliantly designed puzzles. they can be really creative and difficult to solve. but one bad thing about the puzzles is they can be really cryptic and that's not good for me. sometimes it becomes extremely challenging and i believe that 95 of the people can't finish this game without looking to a guide or walkthrough video. especially the secret level was that close to make me ragequit. the soundtracks are also very bad chosen and there are music only in the 10 second storytelling cutscenes. overall good sides entertaining puzzles good art style sometimes fun gameplay bad sides no story no soundtracks bad controls some over difficult puzzles"
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-07-11,the game is so amazing and in every chapter there is new and different puzzle without any word i enjoy the dark story and dark environment
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-06-10,really short cute little enjoyable game but there are others in same genre much better in my opinion such as far series.
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-04-23,"a true masterpiece in design. really no way to describe it. it is the kind of games that seem simple but they will keep you going hard! do not miss the chance to play this game. if you have the opportunity to grab it on sale or not, go for it. the kind of games you got to try to understand what people mean and know for yourself."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-03-08,"limbo is a very unique, abstract game that is very interesting to play. there's some good stuff here, the puzzles were often good and made me think and the graphics have a unique style which i enjoyed very much but the movement, story, some puzzles and sections of the game can all be confusing and annoying. first of all, the movement. you can't use the arrow keys to move and controlling the character sometimes feels clunky. missing jumps because you didn't get the exact timing right, doing trial and error just to accomplish basic tasks isn't enjoyable. the story of the game is way too vague, it feels like it's trying to tell a story but that's not the focus at all. normally, abstract storytelling is my kinda thing but it just doesn't work when it's this vague. some puzzles are also annoying to deal with. some puzzles mess with your movement and a lot of them require precise jumps which, as i mentioned before, isn't the easiest thing to figure out in this game. in it's core, i think this is a good experience but it definitely has a lot of flaws."
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-02-17,a very good puzzle game that gave me several moments of anger and happiness.
Puzzle,Limbo,2023-01-31,"this is a really fun and beautifully designed game. the puzzle solving is pretty clever. there's no music throughout, only ambient sounds here and there. this can be called a short and different experience."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-11-18,"the first game i ever owned on steam. great atmosphere, fun gameplay, pretty spooky."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-10-18,simple but great. the game really suprised me. the graphics are minimalistic and there is no speech but the atmosphere is awesome.
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-09-10,"i really enjoyed playing limbo. it has good atmosphere and puzzles are challenging to solve but not frustrating. however there is no music at all, just some ambient playing sometimes."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-08-23,"a great story to be interpreted. the dark and silent ambiance is just terrific. puzzles requires some reflection. music is gorgeous. the environment is highly stylish, and there are numerous moments where you can feel how small and sickly the character is. boss fights are epic. lighting is terrific. if the game definitely is quite short, the eggs to collect and the achievements to get manage to make it last a bit longer. you certainly should be okay to die a lot to understand all the traps of this game. in a sense it may seems like a die  retry kind of game. i am very aware that 'limbo' has something of really empty and hollow. nevertheless i can't deny that i have been stuck in its universe and atmosphere all throughout. must test."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-08-19,"this game was a present for my birthday, i didn't expect that i'll become addicted to this fabulous indy game. sure 6 y.o. i wasn't too good at puzzle games but the atmosphere and the environment confused my mind. even though, till this day i'm still playing and reminding myself that i had the best gaming experience ever."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-07-28,"simple but quite good. ambience is creepy, character animations are fluent and most importantly, puzzles are pretty good."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-06-27,"solid but basic platformer, with sections of creativity and intrigue bookended by formulaic but welldone segments."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-05-20,"from the first sight limbo may come across as a rather simple 2d platformer, but underneath lies a pretty challenging and unique experience. even after more than a decade since it's launch, the distinct art style still holds up, creating a beautifully melancholic atmosphere. sound design, the minimalistic soundtrack are solid aswell and complement the visuals. the core gameplay loop relies on dying to learn how to overcome it's obstacles, its not a bad design choice by any means, dying in limbo can be part of the fun, generally, but it can get on your nerves eventually. the physics based puzzles are punishing when you encounter them for the first time, but they're satisfying nevertheless once you figure them out. of what there is of the story, it's left mostly up to the player's interpretation, unless you're willing to find additional info on it outside of the game's environment. still, it's enjoyable and drives you forward to see how it ends. not gonna try to spoil it, but if you've played inside before limbo, like i did, limbo's ending will feel very familiar. in my case, it left me wanting something just a bit more again. even though 2d platformers generally arent my jam, i had fun with limbo, it's definetly a good and unique game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-03-22,"limbo is a puzzleplatform video game developed by independent studio playdead and originally published by microsoft game studios. limbo is a 2d sidescroller, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character. the player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister. the developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. playdead called the style of play trial and death, and used gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions."
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-03-16,simple and brilliant. the result of game  art. game mechanics is great and it's mood quite unique. puzzles are quite easy but since mistakes often means death and restart
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-02-27,great game good gameplay good graphics interesting story i want see more limbo games
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-01,"limbo, is one of the most iconic 2d platformer puzzle games ever. game's visuality is breathtaking. black and white tones are used very well. transition among the white and grey colours, and the blurry effect makes a depressed and scary atmosphere. when it comes to core game loop, design is simple and classic. solve the level's puzzle, and move through right of the screen to advance new level. the level design is based on puzzles that can be solved with platform elements. the game has only 24 levels and the game time is only 2 or 3 hours. yes, this is a short game. but the levels are well thought out. some levels can force you even on the second play. the game mechanics are quite simple and efficient. core mechanic's are moving to four directions and pulling something. and they actually enough for a puzzle platformer game like that. with good physics and animations, you can really enjoy that mechanics."
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-08-18,"alright game for 3 hours. not as good as inside, but it came out earlier as well."
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-07-22,"amazing game, gave me chills at some moments, a little bit hard in some of the levels, but very intriguing to the point of making me keep going even if was difficult to go forward."
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-06-18,hey! i am synelong. and that's my opinion of this game. limbo is a brilliant game for me. great graphics and very atmospheric music and sounds in the game. sometimes the game can scare you when you play on headphones and in a dark room. i went through the game twice. and i must say that i will definitely come back to this game. i love this game with all my heart.
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-06-18,"i found the atmosphere to be  wild as  and same goes to the traps that you have to deal with, and as the 23 hour game continues, the puzzles get more creative which made it never boring. i guess the only downsides i had was how little spider  was in the game, and that the stoty wasn't really there as much as i personally wanted. it was difficult for my dumbass to figure out what the plot was. but it still a blast and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick neat ass game. oh yeah, art stiyle makes me very happy face"
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-06-07,simple. beautiful concept and art. great mechanics. great balance between difficulty and clever puzzles. the sound and atmosphere fit perfect with the concept.
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-05-22,"i don't think i've ever played a game that was so incredibly overrated. the visuals are great. the art design really resonated with me and the idea of a nonverbal game is also something i can get behind. now i remember when it came out and basically became a viral hit. i'd played the demo to death and really wanted to play the full thing but never was able to realize it until today. the anticipation probably did it no good at all. maybe i'm just not in the right headspace right now, but i'm not sure if a single minute was actually fun. sure, the visuals and atmosphere are appealing. but that's about it. puzzles were either boring or frustrating and none were particularly hard maybe 3 that i actually enjoyed. the controls also really held it back. i played with a gamepad and they actually managed to f up twobuttoncontrols. i also really despise timingbased puzzles, of which this game has a lot. the biggest problem about the puzzles was that i could often clearly see the solution but was unable to solve it despite that usually because of the timingbased nature, which is the most frustrating thing ever. they also kinda went the dark soulsroute, where you have to die multiple times to figure something out. generally a fun idea, but here it just didn't fit at all. the movement is way too slow for that and the puzzles weren't challenging enough to bring satisfaction upon completion. also, this game has little to no story. people might tell you that it's just very subtle which is true and that there is a lot of depth to it i don't think so. sure, some intriguing things happened here and there but nothing was ever really explained not even visually and it felt very unfulfilling overall. i'll try to read up on it and find out more but this is about the game itself and not its supporting literature  admittedly it was the movement that felt clunky and not the two buttons"
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-04-29,"really unique and awesome puzzle platformer game, i prefer inside but limbo is amazing as well."
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-04-22,mediocre game. everything is. so now i just need to fill this review for 75 characters. thanks.
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-04-05,"very interesting indie game, with a pretty nice gameplay and story to it. it was probably one of the first indie games that i liked so much."
Puzzle,Limbo,2021-01-08,"you will like this 2d puzzle platformer if you are into extremely simple controls but challenging gameplay, and if you are a fan of the dark aesthetic and the spooky atmosphere. my only negative feedback is that at times it wasn't very clear what i should do next and the controls were really annoying and not intuitive when the gravity changes."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-12-28,"without being presumptuous it tells you a very interesting story so quietly you may not even notice, but it's there. i think judging the platforms or puzzles is not the point of this game, but even though they're pretty good."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-12-27,"i played this game with my mother and my sisterinlaw, of whom neither had played a pc game before, and both really enjoyed it. it's simplicity really goes hand in hand with all of it's other qualities. it truly shines because of it's art style and intriguing atmosphere that are both complimented by it's mysterious plot. the puzzles are fantastic and fun, the controls are simple, the mechanics are great, the sound, level, world and character are design are done brilliantly. the openended storyline and the lack of  almost  anything related to the characters and the world is something that may bother you, but ultimately, i ended up enjoying that a lot more than i thought."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-12-17,"played it in 2020, and had a lot of fun yet. the tense moments and the atmosphere gives you a great feeling of the character. not so hard puzzles and entertaining gameplay. would advise everyone who loves the platform genre."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-12-17,a wonderful game made in an original style that perfectly conveyed the atmosphere of what is happening.
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-12-02,it's always nice to try different games. this one of those games which you just give it a try and you like it.
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-11-15,"love this game for unique atmosphere. music, idea. so fresh at that time when was released."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-10-10,"a short story only 13 hours of a boy i guess who can't swim, sprint and many more things. you basically can do 3 things walk, jump and action which is most of the time pull something. the game is a mix of puzzles and jumprun elements. there are many checkpoints, so if you die you don't have to replay the whole level. the main goal i guess is to anticipate the traps and challenges and avoid dying. in the beginning the puzzles are very easy, in the end you sometimes don't even know what the developer wants from you."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-10-07,"incredible atmosphere and sound effects. some puzzles are cool, some are somewhat cheatyish. i would give it a better rating if it were a bit longer and had some more variety."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-09-09,"very simple, black and white. yet it delivers a very good atmosphere! the puzzles are sometimes challenging. theories about its ending is even more exciting than game itself. i really enjoyed playing this game! april 2020"
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-09-08,"ive just got back into playing this, its a great puzzler but i cant believe i keep falling for the daft almost obvious stuff. i cant get over that its so old, too !"
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-09-04,"just really good platform game. nice story, some puzzles to solve. something for me"
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-06-30,"limbo is a 2d, blackandwhite, physicsbased minipuzzle platformer that relies heavily on an eerie atmosphere and simple yet evolving puzzle mechanics, rather than stunning visuals or storytelling. the atmosphere worked really well for me, with the minimalist ambient music and sound effects complimenting it beautifully though i wish the soundtrack was more pronounced. however, the puzzles only got engaging more or less halfway through the game, the first half being closer to a walking simulator which, in the case of a platformer essentially means keeping right pressed for prolonged amounts of time. still, ultimately pretty enjoyable, with rewarding secret areas, and a nice final challenge in the form of an achievement to finish the game in one sitting with 5 or less deaths which takes about an hour."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-05-22,"the game is a difficult game, but an adventure game is not finished yet people are going crazy in some places"
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-05-12,"it is a really good game, challenging and, in my opinion, has a nice level design and visuals. but, where is the plot my dude?"
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-04-23,this game creats such a creepy atmosphere that took my breath away back in 2011. how does it hold up in 2020? still pretty damn good. there is a minimalist style to the art. the story is ambiguous if you can even call it a story really. but overall this game still holds up. its quite short but its really polished. even today you wont see anything quite like this.
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-04-20,"the game is interesting, the story is almost unknown and everything that can be done is theories through the designs of maps, monsters and a mysterious character that appears at the end, the difficulty can be complicated if the player tries to make the achievements more difficult, but to complete the game id say its average, there are some phases that will require a little more elaborate thinking from the player. the game does not have any background music and is also in black and white which gives the game a more mysterious atmosphere."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-03-31,interesting platformpuzzled gameplay. nice game. i did have a problem with the storytelling portion. the game gave no background of what was going on except for the game details in the steam store. there was no cutsceneintegrated method of telling a very simple story.
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-03-18,puzzles are super frustrating so totally not worth it! i regret playing this game!
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-03-03,"clever puzzles, cool art, short duration. simple gameplay that revolves around dying to figure out what you need to do."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-01-10,this game creates something new. the experience is very good. but sometimes you feel bored because of the atmosphere.
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-01-10,"a great and punishing puzzle platformer. the setting's on the darker side, which won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the atmosphere does pull you in. there is some exploration available if you're into that. a bit short like the others say and there isn't really a story, but it's still a nice experience nonetheless. overall, a sweet and simple platformer."
Puzzle,Limbo,2020-01-10,"minimalistic graphics combined with minimalistic controls, but the endproduct is fascinating. dark and melancholic atmosphere combined with a 2dboy as maincharacter who solves puzzles and doesnt try to die a cruelsome death. the game is absolutely worth literally every cent and it should cost way more then it does. grab it now! shoutout dave for gifting this to me! 8.510"
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-11-25,"simple and brilliant. the result of game  art. game mechanics is great and it's mood quite unique. puzzles are quite easy but since mistakes often means death and restart, that's a good thing, to avoid them into become annoying. checkpoints are well and often placed. it somehow reminded me of out of this world wich is a game i loved. game sound is also amazing, focused on details and ambience with no music, making it's dark mood even more creepy. the weakest point is the game lenght... quite short... they could've made the game a little bigger, with harder puzzles near the end, but for 10 bucks it's more than worth it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-21,"despite its very unpretentious appearance, this game feels, in its own way, a very beautiful and interesting way... in terms of atmosphere, plot, sound designoften the sound echoing from some movement seems like... a feeling of loneliness in a huge gray world with various huge mechanisms and houses that is not clear where they come from... what kind of place is this?. this game is not only a quest to think, but also a deep journey to feel, if i may say so."
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-04,neither platformers nor puzzle games are my sort of game. having said that limbo comes close to perfection in delivering fair puzzles and fun interaction. toward the end some jump sequences are a tad to frustrating. i played the game with the aid of the walkthrough by dekap which really adds to the experience. its like playing a virtual coop. great job there!
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-08-09,"i found this game to generally be pretty frustrating, but i suppose my issues lie more with the general faults of the genre that limbo lies within than limbo itself."
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-07-24,"i don't understand the 1010 or 910 scores from reviewers. but for what it is, the game is pretty good. for only a few  on steam, it is worth playing. the audio and visuals are good enough and the puzzles can get pretty tricky towards the end. if you go in with reasonable expectations, you will have a fun time."
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-05-22,"loved the atmosphere, sound and art style, but the gameplay is awful. basically to finish the game, you'll need to die a lot... so you can figure out the puzzles, which are not that good either. pickens get stuck in limbo."
Puzzle,Limbo,2019-02-11,"dark, grim, atmospheric, mysterious. full of smart puzzles its easy to this game to draw you in, unfortunately its short but its one of the best indie games ever made. the gameplay is fun and immersive. definitely worth playing if you are into atmospheric puzzle games. i think you should give it a try regardless. 8.510"
Puzzle,Limbo,2018-10-26,"good old 2d games nostalgia... and it's not just that, this 2d black n' white game with its strange sound effects frightens you to the core, and makes your brain hurt!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2018-10-15,"the expression less is more a best way to describe this game. awesome sound, atmosphere  level design."
Puzzle,Limbo,2018-08-06,nice and dark platformer. not good as inside but still an awesome experience.
Puzzle,Limbo,2018-08-02,"late review  my experience i played limbo for a bit everyday and i liked it it could be a bit frustrating at some points because you die a lot so at some points it's not really solving a puzzle but dying until you get the right timing. despite the sometimes frustrating deaths, the game has a lot of good puzzles! also the artstyle is lovely, it's really dark and simple but yet so beautiful and deep. there's also no option to change your keybinding, so you'll be playing with the goodold arrow keys story there isn't really a proper story, you just get thrown into the game. from what i can make out of it you're a boy that's searching for his girlfriend or sister in this horrific world called the limbo. conclusion if you love good puzzle games with a darkish artstyle and can handle cheap deaths without destroying your keyboard this will be the perfect game for you!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2018-03-06,"it's pretty depressing to see how many people's lack of aesthetic appreciation makes them bash this game. is the gameplay simple? yes, it's supposed to be. does the character die a lot? yes, he's supposed to... who cares, you have unlimited lives! the long and short of it is this it's probably as visuallypleasing as a black and white game could possibly be, and the gameplay is as original as a simple walkjumpgrab control scheme could possibly be. the mood is great, the puzzles are both challenging and rewarding, and in general, this is not a game you could compare to any other, aside from the fact that it's a platformer. anyone who doesn't appreciate simplicity and elegance like this should just get back to their library of loud, overproduced fps's and keep their malnourished opinions to themselves, as they're simply not equipped with the sensibilities to fairly judge a game like this. and yes, it could have been longer...."
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-12-30,"this is a very simple and creepy game. it mixes great puzzles with a wonderfully interesting aesthetic, to make a unique and puzzling game. i found myself very confused by this game, as the story is very open ended, leaving the door open for theorizing. my only problem is its rather disappointing length, clocking in about 1 hour, which is a bummer, as i would've liked to experience more of this game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-11-08,limbo is awesome little game that is best to be finished in one go. i don't mind the game being short it's better than artificially bloated games that lose their charm half way through. the only flaw for me is a very low difficulty.
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-10-31,"beautiful game with intriguing world and immersive, dark atmosphere. and while i'm not a puzzle enthusiast, i found them to be interesting and reasonably challenging. even the minimalist story told entirely through images i'm ok with. there's only one problem. the ending. i don't think it's a spoiler to say there's none. after i got invested into the main character and his quest, it felt like developers had shown me a giant middle finger. imagine if the lord of the rings abruptly finished when frodo enters mount doom with the one ring. it's that kind of an ending."
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-10-30,"excellent art and music the game is a work of art, the puzzles are very interesting in the beginning and quite but not very interesting in the second half of the game. i actually though that the game will go more in the direction of violence and philosophypsychology e.g. seeing another character walk into a pool and die, just to bounce over his dead body that's the strongest moment"
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-10-12,"really love the onedimensional aspect and black and white graphics in this game. has quite a relaxing charm despite the traps that you encounter along the way. a great way to while away an hour or two. only downside is the replayability, once you've completed it, that's it  each new game is the same. simple but fun!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-08-30,"limbo is a puzzleplatform video game developed by independent studio playdead. the game was released in july 2010 on xbox live arcade, and has since been ported to several other systems, including the playstation 3 and microsoft windows. limbo is a 2d sidescroller, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character."
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-08-10,"limbo a dark story and challenging puzzles uncertain of his sisters fate, a boy enters limbo. limbo is a puzzle platformer where you play as this boy searching for his little sister the entire game aside from a few exceptions is black and white, this makes for some really great moments in the beginning of limbo as its hard to tell whats a trap or enemy and what isnt.. this keeps you on your toes and suspicious of everything these initial moments of this little less than 4 hour journey for me was my favorite.. the game is very much a game of trial and error, and the game is generous with its checkpoints being nearly instantaneous.. knowing where youre going to mess up and most of the time having an instant spot for you to try again keeping this games momentum steady after these initial moments of dealing with traps and a giant spider, the game slowly starts to be more puzzle focused and this is where i started to fall out of love with this game not that the puzzles are bad, im just not a huge fan of problem solving while im platforming and looking out for suspicious shadows.. youll be pulling boxes, throwing switches, and timing jumps and other buttons to progress through the game.. i found a lot of these puzzles to be decently challenging, though none too complicated or having too many steps but a few definitely did come close and i may or may not have had to look the answer up for a couple.. with so many limbo clones out there now, going back to play limbo and playing through these puzzles is a bit of a drag because ive seen them so many times now i wouldve preferred if the whole game was like the first few chapters of deception i felt there was something really special there. it kept me hooked and intrigued hoping for more moments like this later on, but sadly they never came personal preferences aside, limbo is a very erie and dark game, youll die gruesome deaths, the game will disturb you and turn your stomach at times and it will get your mind going both for the puzzles and trying to figure out just exactly whats going on with the story even with the dozens of clones out there, limbo stands out as something special and unique.. one of the most enjoyable and unsettling puzzle platforming games ive played i give limbo an 810"
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-07-30,i think that this is truly a unique game and i would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then i think you should give this game a try.
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-07-25,"completion finished game once. pros  charming visual style that strikingly utilizes lighting to create an unwavering melancholy atmosphere. although the aesthetic is certainly simplistic, the game is short enough to not overstay its welcome.  interesting puzzles that test logic rather than mastery of game mechanics, particularly in the first half of the game. this is a welcome departure from most puzzle games today and the pacing is incredibly tight in the first 2 hours or so. i cannot emphasize how much fun i had with the game during these parts and my score is much higher due to this.  interesting piece of visual storytelling that while not exactly mindblowing, invites a wealth of theories and guesswork that adds to the mystique and aura of the game. cons  later puzzles are less interesting than the earlier ones, though significantly more difficult. this leads to the game feeling like its actually slowing down, which is detrimental for an adventurepuzzle game. despite this, they never got too frustrating or repetitive. the second half just simply pales in comparison to its far superior first half.  many things in this game simply move too slowly. although i understand that the slow movement facilitates the mood and tone of limbo, retrying puzzles can feel like a pain when you have to wait for an elevator to slowly rise or watching your character inch a block across the floor once again. if the puzzles were easier this would've been less of an issue, or maybe i'm just dumb, but some of the sections took me several tries and having to amble back through the level repeatedly got old fast. final statement  despite the noticeably worse pacing and less original puzzles in its second half, limbo is a stylish, aesthetic experience that will absolutely captivate you for a few hours. true score 8.4"
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-04-30,"this monochromatic title sports a rich atmosphere and gripping action scenes. the gritty depiction of this game fits it perfectly, and the deaths are just gruesome enough to remind you of the unforgiving forest that you find yourself in. the puzzles are fun to solve, and listening to the rain or the clanking of industrial machines really helps me become immersed in the game and curious as to where my brighteyed friend is heading. an amazing game with outstanding visuals."
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-04-24,dark. artistic. difficult. those three words sum up the game experience for me in a nutshell. platformer game with a ending that left me still wondering why. it's open for interpretation
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-03-30,this is my favorite game! i played it five times and i will play more and more if you never played this game before you must go to the store and get it right now
Puzzle,Limbo,2017-03-16,"i think it's a bit overrated. game has some flows. the physics puzzles are nothing special, sometimes clever. i feel like they did run out of ideas pretty quickly, and some ideas were never developed."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-20,"a stark, sinister puzzle platformer that is monochromatic both visually and tonally. pros  grainy noir black and white art style lends perfectly sets the mood of the title  tight controls, giving a tangible feel to the world  challenging but fair puzzle design, leaving the player feeling clever more often than frustrated  excellent pacing and set piece placement  deep, mysterious game world cons  3 hour run time the mystique of the world raises so many questions, and unfortunately few are answered by the end. one of the best puzzle platformers in recent memory, held back only by its run time. a must play"
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-08-29,"great platformer for the evening or two . atmosphere provides a good incentive to play . among the few drawbacks is no music , if only a little would like ."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-08-09,"limbo its an amazing journey! the good beautiful graphics solid gameplay some of the puzzles are very good very interesting and unique concept at least when it came out cool ragdoll animations relaxing experience did i mention the art its amazing? the bad some of the puzzles can be a little tedious story is almost nonexistent, although i have to say this is one of the things that makes it great too. can be a little short. 1010"
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-07-10,"i think this game is good, but a bit overrated. first let's talk about the goods. as i really love film noir, the art style is what got me hooked. music is also really great, no doubt about that! shame they haven't released a complete version of the ost. control is very simple  only movements and one action key. puzzles are quite tricky. you have to die many times to figure out how to not die. now onto the bads. story? don't even mention it because it doesn't exist. the ending made me particularly frustrated because it made no sense and explained nothing! furthermore the game is so short i can finish it within 2 hours. there is no replay value. at best, it's an artsy game. but at worst, it can also be called style over substance. if you remove the music and art style front, you are left with a 15yearold flash game. the whole game just feel halfbaked. i got this game because it was free for a day on steam. there's no way i'm buying this game at 9.99. to smilzoboboz like it or hate it, you have to die until you get it because that's the whole point of the game. i agree that the game doesn't give you a reason to move forward. it asks you to imagine what the story is about which i think is just an excuse for the lack of story."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-07-04,"i don't get it, you can't ask players to play a puzzle platformer if you don't give them a reason to move further and further to their right. started the game, no tutorial stared at the screen for a whole minute until i actually tried to press random keys, there was no bgm, died multiple times for things i couldn't predict since i've been given no knowledge of the world whatsoever. speaking of that, my idea when it comes to death in games is that it should be a punishment for not having put to use the knowledge andor instrument you were given before, you can't teach knowledge by killing players. still, the main concern is still about the reason to move forward, for example if you need to rescue a princess you run and try your best to get to her but in this case you just bore yourself on a greish world solving puzzles at least at the beginning of the game, where a reason to move forward is the most important thing. ah, finally, setting jump and up on a single button was a terrible design idea. if any of you can help me appreciate this game, please do in the comments below, i'd really like to i'm actually quite fond of platformers."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-06-25,"an ok puzzle platformer. the art and the dark atmosphere are nice and unique, but the puzzles are not that hard, only 1 or 2 are really  the beginning until like 40mins into the game, it appears that the story will be deep and will make you think, but as the game goes on, it seems that everybody left the development, with the exception of the programmer. the story is left behind and you keep seeing the same boring things over and over again boxes, saws, magnets... it's not bad, but it's not an incredible game either. 510"
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-06-23,"everything about this game is damn near perfection, but it drags come the concrete half. it was entirely too mechanical and disengaging, failing to communicate whether or not there's a relevance as to why it shifted at all. it oughta' have benefited attacking emotion all the way through."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-04-09,"i do not know that what just has happened that game's industry has lost its art and beautiful way and just converted to a commercial industry for making more money. an industry that in its history had presented some project like resident evil 4,crash bandicoot warped, red dead redemption and many more to surprise us, now converted to a place for some titles like watch dogs,assassin's creed and also annually series of call of duty without any main changes and just publishing for making more money for its company. although games like limbo are like a dim light inside the darkness that remmber us that games are more art than business for profit."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-03-14,"great game drenched in atmosphere and style. lacking in a bit of substance andor length, this game is worth playing nonetheless, especially considering you can pick it up for dirt cheap these days."
Puzzle,Limbo,2016-03-05,"uniquely rendered world, decent puzzles, and a generally strange ride. at times it felt like lord of the flies and at others like i was in a tarkovsky film. somewhat hampered by being soooo basic and rather short."

Puzzle,Limbo,2015-11-09,"one of the first games i think of when it comes to talking about indie gaming, it nails the stark and depressing feeling better than its many other stylistic imitators. dark as can be, sometimes gruesome, it's a haunting journey that'll stick with you. while it's over pretty quickly, it is plenty challenging and has such a gloomy atmosphere that you might actually feel glad it's over when it is. a great example of how to tell a story without words, and how to use sound or lack thereof."
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-10-26,this is puzzle adventure game. the game is simple but learnable. player must solve the puzzle to finish the game. the graphic is black and white but it make more mysterious.
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-10-01,"tier 2  a stunning audiovisual experience with a distinct aesthetic that it knocks out of the park  heightens immersion by combining its aesthetic, world, and gameplay seamlessly  adventurous sequences that grow in ambition while growing in difficulty ? some puzzles feel needlessly tedious andor complex  story is fairly shallow and lacking, little connects the main sets of the world together  gameplay is sometimes rough around the edges, forcing repetitive deaths and replay"
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-09-08,"the graphics and atmosphere are amazing. the spider scene is great, however, if you would subtract that one from the game, it would be much more boring and that's the main problem i have with it. it's not that the game is too short, it's just that most puzzles are way too easy and you're basically just walking around this dark world. however, if you're here for the visuals and the great experience, it is well worth it. so, i still recommend playing it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-08-08,"pretty boring. i played 40 minutes the game is only 70 minutes long anyways, apparently and the puzzles and platforming were not stimulating, pretty basic and weak. the game seems to try to hinge on a dark imposing atmosphere, but it's not enough to carry such a weak game. also very little value in its length. if you're looking to play a video game this is a 510. if you're looking for some kind of art project i guess you would rate it higher? although i feel like other games can cut just as good an atmosphere while actually backing it up with gameplay."
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-06-19,"limo is a game full of creativity, limo is very rigorous in its selfimposed limits. it has no color, no cutscenes,minimal music and no 's constantly surprising you with fresh and original ideas.limbo is a brilliant adventure which surprises you with every new puzzle idea it dreams up,and how morbid can be.brilliant game"
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-06-05,"this is a good game, the graphics are not that fancy but the game was kinda deep and it made me think. i did not figure out what the game was really about, but it was quite enjoyable!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-04-13,"normally i avoid a game with dark corners and spooky creatures simply because for one, they all seem to remind me of my older brother trying to jump out and scare me and that gets tiring when you turn 10. limbo, however, is scary for another reason mystery. i say this game is mysterious because for starters, you are in limbo itself! the mythological place where the most evil people are sent to live in eternal torment and are forced to watch themselves die again and again and again. that is exactly what i ended up doing in this platformer die die die die die! almost anything can kill you in this game. bear traps, falling into a hole, drowning, getting shot by a dart, taking a light blow to the head by a falling tree, short circuiting hotel signs, spiders bigger than your house, and even buzz saws because why the hell not? this isn't a game about avoiding obstacles like in your average platformer. this is a true fight for survival! this little boy i forget his name finds that his sister got lost in limbo some how on her way to the bathroom from her bedroom. now the boy has to go get her back. not sure if he is really brave or just as dimwitted as his sister. anyways, he runs through the whole thing and the player has nothing to look at but a black foreground and a white background. yet as simple as that sounds, there is a lot of stuff to push through. the object of the game is to make it to the end and find your lost sister. seems easy, but you have to watch for danger and you also have to solve a few puzzles. dying is very easy in this game, so there is no health bar nor lives. the game does have checkpoints that mark your progress. simple controls directional arrows keys to move, duck, jump and the ctrl key to use action. action is typically something such as grabbing a block and using the arrow keys to move said block in the direction you like. this poor kid can't really jump that high, so the player often has to find an object to leap onto so he can jump higher. the enemies cannot be killed. that's right, they cannot die by your hand, but they can kill you! most of the time if you run into a shadowy figure throwing rocks at you, you can make him run away by just getting close, plus they are an uncommon sight. most of your obstacles involve things such as closed doors that need to be opened via a switch and are only open for a temporary amount of time, or possibly a machine gun that triggers when you break the laser pointer beam. i swear this game is designed to make the player die numerous times. even after multiple playthroughs i still fell for the same traps again and again! bear trap on the ground and a rope dangling just above it? seems safe, but wait! what is that hanging above the rope? another bear trap! and it falls just as i touch the rope! deaths are gruesome in limbo, i mean you can get split apart, dismembered, break limbs and bend in really creepy positions, have your head severed, and they all end with the boy lying down, closing his eyes and accepting death. but despite the difficulty and the fact that you must use your head to solve every puzzle, limbo is fantastic! the art is creepy and disturbing, but fits the mood of a dark underworld where the living are forbidden to roam. the animations are very smooth and polished. even the soundtrack is amazing and it isn't even sound! it is literally called silent music. it seems as if you are not listening to music at all, but at the same time your spine has chills, your hairs stand up, and your heart beats incredibly fast! it isn't the difficult puzzles or the potential dangers you face that make you this tense and excited at the same time the soundtrack is where it's at. and the finale is spectacular! this game was subtle all the way through until you solve the last puzzle. after numerous attempts of manipulating gravity and getting chewed apart by buzzsaws, you... i can't even describe what happens next, it's just too good to put into words. just play limbo all the way through and you will see why the finale is jawdroppingly amazing."
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-04-02,very nice. i played the game twice  on mac and android tablet nexus 7. very cool puzzles  secrets! and my favorite character  the spider the only bad thing about this game is  it's pretty short. i would spend much more time playing it!
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-03-19,"gorgeous, brutal, and disturbing, it's no wonder so many games try to duplicate it's style. the elegant design fuses solid gameplay with incredible aesthetics, and an ambiance second to none. a must play."
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-03-19,"beautiful atmosphere, perfectly simplistic design of control. a casual game that belongs in anybodies library. a great game if you can find it for 5 dollars or less."
Puzzle,Limbo,2015-01-17,"limbo is a simple yet incredibly atmospheric puzzle platformer. you wake up as a young boy, lost in a confusion of deep blacks and blurred greys. you're there to find your sister  but you wouldn't know it with no dialogue spoken or written. this just adds to the dark mood of the game, which is already dark enough due to the many heartbreaking ways you can die skewered by giant spiders, crushed between moving platforms, drowning... and the camera lingers just a little too long on the dead body of the child, which makes you that little more distraught. luckily, it has a near instant reloadcheckpoint scheme similar to that of super meat boy. the puzzles throughout this world are mostly straightforward, and scale in difficulty pretty evenly. you may come across a few speed bumps, but perseverence is the key. perhaps my only gripe is that it ended fairly abruptly, after a relatively short time."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-11-24,the game has a captivating story line interwound with puzzles to clear them up and move forward in the game. character development has been done well. game play is nice but not great.
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-11-04,"simple gameplay, simple idea, excellent platform. if there is something like poetic platform, then this game is the origin. the game is quite short in length and leaves wanting more and this the only negative."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-11-03,"me and my fiance played through this game and loved every minute of it. its puzzle elements are uniquely applied to the progression and the situation. the art style is sweet and unique and the atmosphere is scary and fitting. the controls are simple, the feel is perfect and the game overall is nothing short of a masterpiece. despite the games short length, i must admit i was satisfied."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-09-20,"i was expecting a lot more. reading a lot of the reviews especially by the players it seemed to be something that you can't miss. well not really, it's really short there are about 20 missions and 34 of them can be done in 23 hours and most of the puzzles are easy it gets a little bit more difficult near the end. the art style is very nice, but apart from that i don't see any reason to replay it. i guess the hype kinda killed it for me."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-06-29,"limbo is a decently fun game with a disappointing story and ending. i would rate this game much higher if the game had any sort of storydriven sequences or anything more than just a scene at the end hinting at something. i like the atmosphere but i am kind of disappointed in this game. this is another example of an overrated indie title, seemingly just because of its lack of content. a game lacking what many other games do well does not make a good game. sometimes critics are up their own  holes too far to realize simple things like this."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-05-26,"absolutely one my favourite games. limbo is the perfect way to mix style and story, always keeping a really good gameplay. yes, it could be a lttle bit too short, but if the game is so brilliant, i doesn't matter too much if it's short. levels aren't so easy and they become really difficult at the end and the ending is awesome. a really good game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-04-05,"i thought the game was well designed and fluid for what it is. you get nothing when you start, no instructions, no direction, nothing. but that was the whole point.. for you to figure your way out of the 'darkmess'. level design was a 910 easy. overall game gets an 810 from me. it's good but only good for what it is. a very simplistic game with complex level design."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-03-09,"limbo is truly a return to the platformer. while short, i found it has a lot of replayability. i've gone through it a number of times, now, and it's still a masterpiece every time i play it. it has a real challenge missing from most games these days, and the gameplay is simplicity at its finest. it's not skimping on the sensory experience, either. both the sound and visuals are stellar to say the least. if you like it, you won't complain about how it's, too short. you will play it again and again. playtime does not  time from beginning to end. it's  to how many hours you sit in front of it. did you only play through mario bros once?"
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-02-02,"very simple, black and white. yet it delivers a very good atmosphere! the puzzles are sometimes a challenge. i really enjoy playing this game! i recommend it!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-01-10,"interesting but sometimes annoying game. after this time, it still hangs at the very end unless you modify the video card settings. the puzzles are too much trialanderror and it makes you die before you can realize the solution."
Puzzle,Limbo,2014-01-05,"the only reason i'm rating this a 'zero' instead of a 'three' is because the overall score is far too high. i purchased this game for its unique art style and because i wanted a good puzzle game that made me think. however, i am not a fan of dying every fivetothirty seconds in order to figure out the next puzzle. it turns what, in my view, should be an interesting puzzle game into a 1990s nes platformer. seriously, the last time i died this often was when i played ninja turtles 1. this game is far from what i'd call an indie masterpiece. it's cheap, it's gimmicky, it's a waste of money."

Puzzle,Limbo,2013-12-28,"a memorable game. limbo demonstrates that a game is not all about crazy graphics or well produced story line. this game is abstract in a way that i believe allows players to interpret the story for themselves and to personally immerse themselves into the game. the clever puzzles, good music and art all collaborate together to create a mood and atmosphere that is well fit for its inception like ending."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-12-27,"limbo is a beautiful puzzle game. simple to grasp, easy to play and doesn't bog the player down in needless story. quite a few of the puzzles were extremely easy, but there's enough to keep you interested. highly recommended, especially at the price."

Puzzle,Limbo,2013-12-11,"after few months i have finally found time for this game. my expectations were high because i heard only praise for limbo. after 7 hours of ultimate atmospheric ride which contains original puzzles, awesome sounds and unique world i must say that i do not regret the time spent. if you like puzzles or adventurelike games you should buy it right now. i promise that you will not regret."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-11-26,"limbo is truly unique, creative, cathartic, scary, fun, immerse, atmospheric and short. as a self professed adventure and puzzle game addict, i must say that limbo provided me with top quality puzzles those that didn't require a walk through but did require pause for thought. some even required a cup of tea! the atmosphere was seamless and the dream never failed. the setting was suitably spooky and the traps did yield a few frights. sadly, it was all over too quickly. limbo brilliant but short."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-11-20,"its enjoyable, atmospheric and in parts quite spooky i'm more than happy to give limbo its props for looking and feeling different, however it is fundamentally a standard puzzle platform game! i enjoyed the game, despite completing it in just over 3 hours over two separate days  of 1 year! so taking a year for me to finish despite only playing for over three hours comes down to the fact i didn't really get into it originally and it's not that long a game! i'm not a massive puzzle fan and there are some parts in this which i found more tedious than enjoyable! however if you do enjoy puzzle platform games, this should definitely be an awesome experience despite its fairly short length!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-11-15,"this game is great. fantastic atmosphere, great puzzles. while it does become a little repetitive by the end, still a fantastic game. highly recommended."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-11-10,"this game is beyond clever. it shows how a well designed game only needs simple controls in this case 5 keys total. you don't need 100 items, 25 levels of development, and 50 different skills you have to acquire by inane hours of killing other players or game creatures. this game kept me interested, i never felt bored the way i do with these massive multiple player rp games."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-11-03,"limbo is a 2d puzzle game with a horror theme. it has appeal from both artistic and game play aspects, but it is definitely not suitable for children. the look of the game is very stylized. the colors are black and white, with a dreamlike presentation. foreground objects are outoffocus, giving a 3d feel to the game. there are spooky atmospheric sounds, and some sounds that are cues to solve puzzles. the character you control is little boy who is completely in silhouette, with two shining dots to show his eyes when he is still alive. the controls are surprisingly simple, move is the analog stick, x is interact, a is jump. the actions your character takes depend on the context, if you jump toward a rope or chain, you grab it. it you jump toward a ledge, you grab the ledge and then up on the analog stick makes you climb up. from these simple mechanics come some very clever puzzles. compared to vessel, which has very complicated actions that use many buttons and both analog sticks, it is a credit to the developer that the puzzles were so good with such a simple control scheme. the game mechanics are not explained ingame. if you are patient, you can figure them all out yourself. i am not quite so patient so i consulted the walkthrough a few times to figure some of these out. with a game of this difficulty, i think there is no shame to consult a walkthrough once in a while if you get really stuck. of course, there is satisfaction in solving a really devilish puzzle. i took at least an hour to solve a puzzle involving crates, a ramp, and an antigravity field. when i finally solved it there was a yes! moment. the horror theme of the game will be a big plus or a big minus depending on your taste. the puzzles are very hard, and take many unsuccessful tries before success. usually an unsuccessful try means death. the character you control has realistic 2d ragdoll physics including simulated blackandwhite gore, and many of the puzzles involve spikes, giant spinning saw blades, spiderlike monster that can impale with their legs, etc. considering that your character is always in blackandwhite silhouette, it is surprisingly shocking when your little guy gets chewed up by a sawblade or impaled on a spike or squashed to jelly in a giant piston. for me this created a spooky and tense atmosphere that added to your motivation to solve the puzzle and avoid gory death. once in a while it was a little too much and i had to look away during the obligatory death before the restart. of course, if you are a fan of 3d survival horror games and horror films, this game will be tame and charming by comparison. i would say that if you were grossed out by quasihorror films like the shining or alien then limbo will be too much for you. for everyone else, i would say this is an excellent game, perhaps the best 2d puzzle platform game ever made."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-10-30,"limbo is the perfect example of how a game can be deep, inspiring and incredibly beautiful with simple gameplay, graphics, sounds and controls. a masterpiece."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-10-02,"limbo is one of the most captivating games i've played so far. after i saw ending, i was thinking about it and i was stunned for a moment when i understood it. it lingered in my mind for a while."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-22,"a gem. how anyone could dislike this very fun, original game is beyond me. so many others try and fail to do what limbo accomplishes with relative ease."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-20,"one of the most beautiful and immersive games i've ever played. an extremely good example of what an indie game is and how wonderful of an experience a wellmade one is. but sadly, like many indies, this game is fairly short, taking most people about 34 hours to complete. but it has a lasting impression, and leaves you wanting more from playdead, more puzzles and perilous obstacles to get past, more of this mysterious, ambient world. navigating through this simple yet beautiful blackandwhite environment to try answer the simple question what is this place and why am i here? is definitely a journey worth taking."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-20,"run, jump and die a lot. i really enjoyed this game despite the lack of text, dialogue, or any real story line. in fact, these features are what make the game stand out. it's a relatively short game, but it kept me entertained."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-16,limbo is an atmospheric beautiful puzzle game from the very first moments of the game you'll love it you'll encounter tons of puzzles that are really challenging although it is a bit short but once you finish it you'll find yourself going back to it and with new experience simply a great amazing puzzle game
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-09,"a fairly overrated game with a fantastic art style. it is a game with only one real flaw, and that is the insanely short length. i beat it in 45 minutes. as the negative reviews all say, it should have been 5 bucks. the puzzles are extremely easy, and if you pay attention, you will never die. i beat the game on both areas dying a total of 3 times. once when i screwed up the platforming, once on the final puzzle and once in the pitch black puzzle section where you have to rely on sound to avoid the traps. the people saying you need to die on multiple puzzles to find a solution are completely wrong. its like dark souls, you can predict every single trap before hand if you pay attention and know how to spot tells. even the traps that give you 3 seconds to react are obvious before hand. it disgusts me that modern gamers still cant spot tells in games. reminds me of dark souls how 90 of attacks from bosses could be figured out in 3 seconds simply by the design of the boss and the arena. on the aethetic again, it sports a dark monochrome colour scheme, with no music except for atmospheric sounds. it also has a great physics engine and minor dust effect to give every falling block force. it is a very very good looking art style and is extremely immersive. the narrative is minimalist. all you know is a girl i believe it said it was your sister or something? has gone to limbo, and you follow her. nothing else is said at all. if you want a complex narrative, you wont find one here. overall, i would have prefered it to be far far longer, and more difficult puzzles. i also would prefer that everyone look at the tells of enemies. regardless, it has a great art style and atmosphere."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-07,"limbo is the first game i've ever played on steam and i'll always feel something special for it just because of this. but limbo is a good game per se excellent graphics, great gameplay, innovative concept and this helps alot. 810"
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-05,"the game stylistics strike first of all the blackandwhite world my opinion game is fine. this atmosphere, faultless animation of movements of the boy, and same fine any his death, whether it be when his body breaks off from largecaliber bullets or from these huge saws, you shouldn't forget also about death from electricity, a spider, traps, crush by a press, falling from height and many other things... struck kachetstvenny sounds. it should be noted very beautiful backgrounds of locations also woods, plants, dead cities. one more moment, game plot the very transparent is unclear that, where, when, as well as why. it is very difficult to understand the beginning and the end, leaving players opportunity to guess long time that occurred while at the end of the game the boy broke that glass and found the sister. small bonus at game there is a 3d mode which can be included having pressed shift 3 d. to a 2d mode it is passed by buttons shift 2 d."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-07-01,"a charmer  and perfect for nonpuzzle fans since the game is so tightly crafted and doesn't confuse players with complicated red herrings. it's not that long or deep, just sort of an evolved simple arcade game. i can pull limbo out when nongamer friends come over and it has instant appeal for everyone."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-06-08,"excellent art and music the game is a work of art, the puzzles are very interesting in the beginning and quite but not very interesting in the second half of the game. i actually though that the game will go more in the direction of violence and philosophypsychology e.g. seeing another character walk into a pool and die, just to bounce over his dead body that's the strongest moment in the game imo, but unfortunately it takes a purely mechanical setting later boxes, saws, magnets i've seen all this stuff in many games. if you take out the art and focus only at the second half of the game, you will see a good but not an outstanding puzzle, much like the ones you can find on kongregate for free. the first part however is simply a work . that's why after finishing this game i have a somewhat mixed impression. also, the ending was unexpected and i didn't get its meaning or the meaning was too banal? i mean, walking thru so many hurdles to just get a girl? duh, that's too teenageroriented. i also agree with some reviewers that most puzzles make you die a few times before you can at all figure out what's going on. that's not too bad, but i still had a sense that the author just enjoys hurting the player anyway, with all these minor flaws which aren't actually flaws the game is just excellent. it surely deserves its popularity and it's definitely a step forward in the genre."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-04-25,"simplicity is a concept in gaming that people frown upon and criticize. limbo ignores that notion and brings something unique and interesting to indie games. limbos black and white setting will not only exclude any sense of complexity, but will also give the player a rather eerie and dark experience. the gameplay includes straightforward puzzles, yet wont put your brain to sleep and still presents a fun challenge. the gameplay is rather static and lacks variation, but features something new and exciting before it gets repetitive. the soundtrack may not blow your mind because limbo prioritizes on ambient sounds rather than its soundtrack. in addition, a sophisticated soundtrack would contradict limbos principle of simplicity and instead disrupt the ambience that enhances the gameplay so much. gamers of the indie genre should be nuts for this game, and rightly so. those who enjoy puzzles and are interested in a very entertaining game shouldnt hesitate to pick this up."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-04-16,"one of the best indie games i've played. unique, magical, beautiful, limbo is definitely a atypical game, you might not like it at all, but missing more games like this..."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-04-15,"limbo is a beautiful, simple platformer in the way another worldout of this world was. artistic graphics and sound with simple controls just arrows and 1 key will bring some interesting puzzles for you. yes, it is a bit short, but not like another world, and i would change1 movie 2 hours for this any time."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-04-13,"it's simple and it delivers! limbo is beautiful, that is unanimous even amongst the hatersdislikers. the sounds are, for me, a 8 out of 10. the gameplay is really really simple, but, since the premisse doesn't promisse anything more than that, i'll give it a 8 as well. the biggest pet peeve is the fact that, indeed, some times you have to die to figure out puzzles. but been keep forgeting that is not a rule and there are guys giving this game a 0. this is bloody ridiculous. limbo is short, simple and fun. it's entretaining and is definitely worth your 10 bucks or so."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-04-11,"this game is good. it is worthy of the time spent playing it. it is pretty intuitive and can really bring you into its dark imagining. however, this game is not worthy of 10 bucks. this is a 2.50 indie game and the fact that the price was raised because of its popularity is shameful of playdead. instead of charging you what the game is worth they seen an opportunity to squeeze more money out of a product regardless of real worth, and it effectively halted all popular progress the game was making. fail decision on playdead's part. that being said, the game itself not considering price could be an 8 or 9 for its genre, but considering bang for your buck, only gets a 6 from me."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-04-07,"i had great fun with limbo, the game's art style and audio does an awesome job of setting a palpable atmosphere. the puzzles are fun and well thought and i just love the pace and theme behind the game. my only complaint would be that i want more, i guess that's the holy grail to keep them wanting more. this is a benchmark on how to make a quality indie platform game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-03-23,"a strikingly beautiful game. this game is a rarity, providing an overall calming experience that never strays too far from uneasiness. it is aesthetically divine, providing and maintaining a wonderful sense of atmosphere throughout. there is simply nothing wrong with this game. it's wonderful."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-03-21,"i love a challenging game. this was challenging, but not in a intellectual way more like a 'howpatientlycanyoukeeptryingtojumpthisledgebeforeyouloseyourmind' kind of way. the constant dying and redying ruined the pace and flow, and i just never felt like i got into it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-02-12,"there's so much to praise the beauty  like limbo. it's a nice hybrid of adventure games and platform games. all the sections of the game are filled with puzzles, which you can solve by dying and trying, again and again. the visuals look nice, which are monochromatic black and white and some shades of grey. sound effects are ok, musics are moody. the story is about a little boy, who's looking for his sister in limbo, which is the edge of hell. the ending reminded me the tv show l o s t, a spectacular show with an open end, the producers of it had given the liberty of commenting and fictioning the ending to fans and viewers. limbo also tries to do it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-02-11,you feel in the limbo. the dark scenery make you feel alone and depressed. and the end of the game make you have a doubt of the history. the sound combines with the atmosphere of the game.
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-02-04,"limbo is a very good game, however its major drawback is the length of the game. its worth the purchase price, but if your looking for a game that will have hours and hours of replay value you may want to look somewhere else."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-02-03,"great visuals and very beautiful. however in my opinion it feels like a trial and error game, though some puzzles you could think before hand, many of the other times you just die in order to know what to do next. i found myself rather bored at this game. i am surprised at the highscore this game gets."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-23,"the best 2d game i have had the pleasure of playing! the scenery, the colors, the sounds, the ambiance, the immersion. i loved it in this game. plus the violent deaths were pretty funny and appealing in a odd way. i would give this game a 10, but a few of the puzzles were overly difficult in my opinion. though i am sure many would love that type of challenge. i also wish the game was longer though and i hope for a sequel or even a game similar to limbo. so far i have not been able to get my hands on on something quit like this. that's how unique and fun this game really was!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-12,"unbelievably disappointing. i thought this was going to be similar to the flash game coma  another sidescroller with great and bizarre art  with plenty of room to explore the world of the game. instead, this turned into a runofthemill platformer within the first half hour. as has been pointed out here many times, the game tests your patience for trial and error, not puzzle solving, and suffers from sluggish or unintuitive controls. worse, though, is having any atmosphere or loose narrative constantly interrupted by pointless deaths from missed jumps. that's really unfortunate, since the first half hour is chilling and enjoyable at the same time, but that mood begins to get killed literally over and over again."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-10,"limbo's startoff is strikingly disturbing but it ultimately loses momentum and becomes an average puzzleplatformer. the good strong art direction pointing everything presentationwise to a palpable eerie mood gory without being cheap perfect physics challenging in the right measure. the bad fails at keeping up with its own standards. a boy lying down in a foggy forest slowly awakens. his vivid eyes nothing but a pair of little flashlights in the colorless environment are the sole hint of life in what would otherwise be a soulless silhouette. as you're allowed to explore the environment under a mere soundscape instead of a regular soundtrack it will become easy to realize actually to really feel through the boy's controls and animation how fragile the protagonist is. but getting stronger is a requirement to progress hereat cost of the player's humanity. this is how limbo starts. the surroundings are a bit creepy but it's simply impossible not want to explore them. and the timing is perfect get yourself under the boy's skin and start to feel comfortable just to face the first barbed deathfirst of many, many others yet to come. limbo manages to make a very strong first impression in any player who dares to launch it regardless of the gamer's preferences. it's disgusting as much as it is compelling, and i can't say much more than that without spoiling your bad trip. but... those mixed feelings last only for 90 minutes or soroughly the first third of the game. yes, part of that comes from the fact the player eventually stops caring about deathand if it was only for that limbo would be a stainless masterpiece. but unfortunately most of it falls into the developer's account due to a severe shift to a more straightforward puzzleplatformer approach. as if it was impossible to keep pushing the player further emotionallybut if that was the case it should have been better to leave the game unfinished and charge less for a packapunch experience. ok, the physics are neat, the puzzles are smartno cheating, no excessive brain meltingbut limbo is all about its settings... which were simply dropped out at some point of the journey for a longer and more bland value raise. still a great game as it is, limbo is somewhat disappointing for raising such a good premise just to get lost in its own mazes."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-06,nice game with an attractive art style but way too short. the puzzles are fun but some of them rely too much on trial and error. still a good buy if you wait for a special on steam.
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-05,"limbo is a darker game, with interesting puzzles, and moments that make you feel tense. the atmosphere and tone that the devs set fits very nicely with this sort of platformer game, and the overall package is a nice addition to any casual gamers library. the game is not that long, and can be completed from start to finish in a few hours. with the length of the game in mind, the 10 price tag is steep. wait for it to go on sale because it has very little replayability."
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-02,"i bought this game for only 2,5"
Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-01,"i have to agree this game was very pleasing visually and the art style set it apart from other similar games. the controls were simple and the puzzles were engaging, and i enjoyed the experience in the beginning. however, this game gets boring quick. the puzzles became extremely bland and chorelike by around the middle of the game. i was begging for the game to end, because who doesn't finish a game they buy? but it was just so boring, it was making me work for it without the slightest bit of fun. it's kind of like when a show takes several episodes of boring fillers to build up for a single event. sure, jump on the bandwagon and praise this game, but the only aspect that makes this game special is simply the art style. otherwise, it's just another platformer, a bland one at that."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,for only 2.50? what a steal. that was a fantastic game that was both disturbing and beautiful. it would not be nearly as good without its style as it would be far too gruesome to take. it's interesting to see the development of the world and question why there are so many traps laid out. the background sounds were perfect to the game and added a sense of mystery to it all. solid b
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i am amazed at the kind of game the developers created, specially knowing this was not a game funded by lots of money. the game is extremely refreshing. i was actually playing it after finishing playing other games for the day and it provided me with nice and not stressing puzzles and quiet environment, making me feel very eased. the game is roughly 90 mb. its really a challenge to make such a detailed game with small size. i am not giving it a 10 because the story was assumed and it did not really take part within the game. it is itself immersing because of the environment and puzzles but not the story. a boy enters limbo to look for her sister its not very appealing, but i did like the end and the steam trophies. i very recommended puzzle adventure 2d game, worth of playing for some hours, although i must warn you that it can take 4 hours to finish it without getting all the trophies, of course."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-28,"the best way to describe this game is mediocre at best. the art and backgrounds are very well done but that's about the only things the game has going for it. for starters, it lacks a story line or any kind of basic information that might give the game coherence or meaning. when you begin, you're more or less thrown to the wolves literally to figure out what the heck you're supposed to be doing. as the game progresses, you move your character across a black and white 2d platform setting and try to solve seemingly simple yet frustrating puzzles. there is no health or life bar in this game. you make a mistake, you die immediately and start over at the beginning of the level and die you will, over and over and over again trying to work through one unexpected hazard after the next. bottom line the artwork is good, the gameplay is simple, the storyline is nonexistant, and the general gameplay can get frustrating. don't buy this game at the regular price of 10 because it's not worth more than 5."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-27,"pros completely stunning in artistic fashion, the puzzles are perfectly aligned in a steady incline of difficulty. i was taken back by the complexity of such a masterful game with no dialogue. without words it would appear thin and drought like of substance, this is absolutely false. the environmental noises are sharply energetic and adrenaline fueled to tingle your spine. the black and white appearance without color is not dull, the amount of shades they use bring such a crisp image, that it appears colorfully delightful with two colors. the difficulty curve is efficient and elaborately forgiving, even when you fail, it reloads a few steps from your misstep. cons the length is not just short, but as if a eye blink in the genre of puzzle games. for 2.50 the game is a steal, 5 is a proper selling point, but i wouldn't venture much higher in price range and pay for it. i would have liked to seeing at least some dialogue at the end of the game, and i wanted to know why the native american individuals were trying to be the death of you. do they have some part in the reason why you are trying to find your sister. there are certain obstacles that could have been shown better to how they conclude, very minor for there were only a few. almost my game of the year of 2012, i give it a 8.95 out 10. a must buy if at an adequate price point."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-19,"limbo captures you from the very start with it's entrancing atmosphere and ambient sound and i enjoyed the game thoroughly from start to finish. puzzles were designed very well as they increase in complexity as you progress but never feel impossibly hard or frustrating. you could also say limbo is very fluid as the lack of loading screens sustains immersion. many have complained that the game is too short, though i personally find the game's length ideal 26hours. the game would begin to lose it's touch and level of entertainment if it went on for any longer."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-08,"limbo is rather well done graphically and the atmosphere is very strangedark. we can't say that the game breathes joy but it is its style so you must have a certain amount of black humor to enjoy it. the game doesn't offer any ingame music but the effects are good and rich enough so that it doesn't bother. regarding gameplay, it gets a little boring after a while so it has nothing of a big hit. but if you grab it at a discounted price, that's okay. replay value however is the biggest flaw and once finished, there is not much to do except trying to finish it again as fast as possible and using as few lives as possible."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-25,"a relatively quick, beautiful, dreary experience. succeeds a creating a deeply depressed mood, and retains a feeling of mystery throughout. commercial pricetag is a bit steep for the amount of playtime."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-23,"meh. yes it was atmospheric. that got old after the 1st or second puzzle. this played like an overgrown flash game. the puzzles were sometimes interesting, but more often than not they were trial and error tedium. try once, die on something you really couldn't have foreseen, try again possibly worth the 2.50 but i was sick of it even during the couple hours it took to complete."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-01,"limbo is 2010's most enchanting game. now pc gamers can enjoy the magic that limbo creates in its subtle yet effective gameplay, graphical style and story. you play a little boy with no name who has been stranded on the edge of hell...limbo. you must venture through limbo dodging all sorts of devious traps and running for your life from attackers to find your sister. the gameplay consists of 2d platforming with heavy puzzle input to avoid the deadly traps. the graphical style is simply put...black and white, there is also a film grain layer which makes it appear as if you were watching it as a film instead . limbo is a short sweet interactive adventure that will take you to hell and back guaranteed,"
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-30,"a beautiful game with very well thought out gameplay, physics, and puzzles. my biggest complaint was that it was way too short. about 23 hours of gameplay."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-13,"many of the puzzles seem to expect the player to either be a masochist, or to not notice that they are pseudopuzzles. by that i refer to the times when you are forced to die to see how the puzzle is done so you can proceed. pseudopuzzles sap much of the satisfaction, and you begin to feel like you've payed money and spent time to get jerked around. i liked the art and music. the controls were slightly awkward but not unbearable. the main negative to this game would be the pseudopuzzles. if it was all good quality puzzles, then the ratings would be appropriate  otherwise it is overhyped and it isn't worth paying much for this. i was fortunate enough to get it for 2.50 on steam, which i think was reasonable. but it isn't worth more than that. it's worth the short amount of time to play, just not worth much money."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-10,"it's difficult to quantify my frustration with this game. honestly, microsoft did a wonder on their xbox controllers because if they were any cheaper, i'd have been buying a new controller. i ragequit several times during my playthrough. i don't consider myself stupid, so i have to assume this game is intended for people less bound by the parameters of perfection to borrow a linein jest of course. or perhaps it's a cultural thing. i prefer to feel like i'm winning a game andor accomplishing small feats versus simply dragging my lifeless corpse through to the bitter end. how is mandatory and repetitive death supposed to equate puzzle solving? quick answer it doesn't. it is simply trialanderror memorization of sequences. that's not how puzzles are solved. puzzles require taking a step back and looking at the pieces available to you. usually all the pieces you need to solve a section of a puzzle are immediately available or at least recognizable. most of the time you aren't even aware of the scope of a sequence until you've died at about 3 or more points in the same sequence. enough about the puzzles. let's talk story. there is none. i found out more about the story reading the synopsis here on metacritic than i did playing the actual game. does that tell you how poor the narrative is? i imagine in order to reach the widest audience and avoid localization work, fees, etc. the developers simply opted not to have anything other than ui for textdialogue. this shows a gross level of disregard for one of the key attractors for games in general but also incompetence to understand the fundamentals of building what one would claim is a game. sure, it's been done before, but usually there is an overwhelmingly stunning performance of another aspect of the game that either negates or marginalizes the lack of story. fighting and racing games come to mind, but both offer clear goals and rewards for player accomplishments. both also offer clear control schemes which also was sadly lacking. bringing us to controls, they are  the purest sense of the word. you would expect to be able to sprint in a game so reliant on timing for its action sequences. but no, an ambulatory, happygolucky trot strange considering the overarching tone is the default pace and fastest you'll move beyond falling. you're only other means of interaction with the world is to scale ledges, drag boxes, swing on ropes, and throw switches hardly an exhaustive list, especially for a puzzle game. even this game's detractors concede that the graphics are good or at least artistically significant. original, i'll grant it, but also annoying. much of the shock and puzzlement rely upon the complete lack of color to differentiate assets, scenery, and traps. some are blatantly obvious, such as giant sawblades, while others are indistinguishable from scenery until you venture into them, like beartraps in anklehigh grass. i'd hardly call that artistic. fiendish is far more appropriate. for redeeming qualities, you have unlimited lives, and abundant checkpoints that prevent you from chucking your machine out the nearest window. but another downer to the unlimited lives is the  inyourface pause between respawns to rub your face in the developer induced failures you're suffering. tldr this blasphemy  is not worth the bandwidth cost of downloading it. watch it on youtube and be grateful there are so many other games to play that don't require anger management or suicide prevention hotlines."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-10,"i thoroughly disliked this game. i only play it when my internet is out or something. it's very boring and could honestly be played on an iphone or something. the quality is not very good and they went overboard with the art style. disappointing, but at least it was only five bucks."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-09-23,"brilliant game in every way, and there are parts where you really get frightened. not only is the gameplay good, but the design is fantastic as well. sometimes, between levels, you stop just to look at extra details in the background. definitely a game you want to finish more than one time. the only two negative sides are  game is really short 16 hours, depends on how many times you die on the way and 2. a minor downside, but too few checkpoints, so at some places, if you die repeatedly at the same place, you might have to start over way back."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-09-19,"love the black  white style to the game and from start to finish i can definitely say it looks beautiful, but it can also feel quite redundant at times. thankfully there are some memorable moments to break the monotony the first boss, the neon signs, and the rotating world all jump to mind. unfortunately while much attention was paid to the artanimation by the developers  the game itself still feels unfinished. there is no story only the title and your imagination to go by, little if any music some levels this works while others beg for atmospheric melodies, and the ending . even having only offered 56 hours of gameplay with no replay value i still don't regret buying it. its one of those indie games worth supporting."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-09-10,"limbo is a sidescrolling puzzle game. it is not long. it has no color in fact, it's not even in 's just black. it has no character development. it has the barest of stories a boy is separated from his sister and has to find  end. and when it was over, i wasn't even sure quite what had happened. but here are the things limbo definitely is concise. i finished in about five hours. efficient. every puzzle is completely fresh no repetition at all. creepy. it got my heart racing more than far cry and my nerves tingling more than amnesia the dark descent. and finally, even though i didn't know what to make of the ending, i spent the next 48 hours thinking about it. if the developers of limbo were going for the sense of dread, isolation, and bewilderment i've felt only in my darkest dreams, they nailed it. one point off for length 910"
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-23,"the visual style and animation is amazing, but the game itself got very repetitive towards the end. overall i liked it, but the last secret level i just played to have the achievement"
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-16,"great artwork, very interesting sometimes adult horror themes, i found the playthrough refreshing and fun. there were, however, a couple challenges which i spent most of my time playing the game on that dropped my rating significantly. i didn't want to play through the game again because of the difficultly of those challenges."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-15,this game really was fun for another indie game and can be scary and i like the 2d physics system. it's like a gothic verion of mario bros. great game. this game was also very nurve racking.
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-09,"i was really happy this came to the pc! at first i didn't like it because i died all the time. then i understood that was part of the game. like old point and click games where you make many wrong clicks when you're figuring out what to do. they built that into the game which was really cool. it felt like i was supposed to die over and over, and all deaths very really gruelsome. this together with the story and setting made me feel a little sad and down... that wasn't my favorite experience but thinking back on it now that makes it even more different and noteworthy. this is a 10 for me."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-27,"one thing i've noticed about games these days is that many people judge a game by their playtime rather than the quality of the actual game. limbo is grim, bleak arty platformer which is extremely welldesigned and has an eerie atmosphere. limbo is pretty short, perhaps about 34 hours depending on your skill. to be clear you're not making the same mistake as that other reviewer you will die, a lot! you might complain over the game being too short, but if it were any longer, you'd just complain about it being overlong and repetitive. this game however, never seems to repeat itself it has some interesting themes to it, but it does lack any sort of a plot. you can argue if that's a good thing, but i can't think how you would implement them into a game like this. lastly, again pointing to that reviewer who said this game has no replay value well of course it doesn't! puzzle games never have replay value if it's a proper puzzle game, once you've learned the solution, what else is there? anyway, i'd say limbo is actually quite short for the price, so i'd only recommend it to people who don't mind parting with a hefty 7 or are in the mood for an arty game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-22,"really beautiful indie game, even gruesome. great use of physics in the puzzles. the only thing that bothered me a little bit was that a couple of the puzzles, in my opinion, were not fair to the player i.e. it was not clear how the environment worked. a very, very good value if you can find it on sale, but not worth full price there's just not enough content to justify 9.99."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-21,"limbo has simple but beautiful art that does a fantastic job setting the mood for the game great rain and fog effects, perfect balance of darkness and needed lighting. the controls work perfectly and are mixed in with some interesting puzzles and enemies add some nice suspense. i will agree that this game is short and could've used some additional levels which is why it can't be a 9 or 10  or a 0 you crazy people but the originality of the art and the well implemented puzzles make it a definite play. just maybe wait for a sale, like i did. also personally i never felt i had to die to learn how to solve a puzzle and didn't find the game super hard like some reviewers and i consider myself a casual gamer."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-20,"overall this game is mediocre at best, i feel 6 is about as accurate as you can give it. is the game well designed? yes. is it well polished? yes. is the art unique and artistic? yes and yes. ok, so the game is well designed and looks good. how does it play? is it fun? is it challenging for the right reasons? what's the overall sense you get from the game? well this is where it starts to fall falt on its face. first  the play control is awful. jumping is not smooth nor is the movement and momentum. when half of the challenge of the game involves getting around its awful play control, you have a problem. furthermore, what about the puzzles? were they clever? did they make sense? were they somewhat intuitive? too easy? too hard? i will say that to all of the above it's about an even 5050 yes or no depending on the puzzle. some were pretty good, others were just inexcusably awful. again, most of the puzzles only become a puzzle due to the  controls. on top of that, some of them just weren't clever... at all, and actually made me pissed at how minimalistic they ended up being some would call this a good thing, i personally do not. and another thing  only in very rare cases will i forgive a game for having water kill you. limbo is not one of those games, in fact it may very well have some of the most comically bad water deaths i've ever seen in video gaming. aside from wading through puddles that are waste high, only to die if you accidently poke your head under water for one millesecond  there are also moments in the game where the water is rising and if you are submerged for even the slightest second you drown. this is not good game design, all it ends up being is a cop out by the developers and in the end it won't score you any points with me. there should be no reason that i die in a puddle of water that literally extends just slightly longer than the length of my body. overall you have to ask yourself when playing through a game, am i having fun? well, most of the time in my playthrough of limbo short by the way since the game hardly has anything to it the answer was no, not really having that much fun. so take it for what it is  it's a game you can appreciate for the effort put in, but as a game itself it doesn't execute very well."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-19,"limbo beings as a simple puzzle game but evolves into a metaphor for things we can only imagine. the art style of the game is uncomplicated and lends itself toward the overall metaphor. many have complained about limbo being overly short while others have described it as an arduous journey that is well worth the effort. i would say that i played through at an above average pace and finished the game in about five hours. many of the puzzles were tricky and the feeling of success was a great reward when i figured them out. as far as the story goes, well will have to form your own opinion about that after you play through. lets just say its an open book. great games leave a simple taste of i want more in your mouth and this game gave me that. sadly there isn't much more i can milk from it so 910. it looses one point for lack of real replay ability. i accomplished 90 of the achievements on my first play through."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-19,"this game is highly overrated in my opinion. the art style is memorable certainly, but the game is a precision platform puzzler. the very nature of the art style black and white, blurry effects means the art style itself inhibits gameplay by putting things in the foreground in your way, and it not being entirely clear is something is going to kill you or not. this is not a good thing. a good puzzle platformer should be able to be completed without many deaths if you can actually sit back and think what you're going to do eg. braid. with limbo, so many of the puzzles simply cannot be attempted first life because they usually result in instant death just finding out what the obstacle is. for example. i see 2 spike traps attached to ropes above me. i have no idea when they will trigger and swing at me. i have no idea the length of rope on the spike trap, so it is pretty much impossible to estimate it's range or if i can outrun it arcing behind me. my only option is to just run in blind and see what happens. admittedly, the game does allow you to respawn after death fairly close to where you died. unfortunately the art style also shoots the game in the foot again because the game is simply not that interesting to look at. yes i agree that vague black shapes that look like giant spiders would be scarier than an actual rendered giant spider, but when you start reusing the giant spider for the 15th time, it kinda loses the effect somewhat. the game is very short, it took me about 8090 minutes to complete it, and there is little no replay value. what's the point in replaying a puzzle platformer if you know where to go and what the puzzles are? there is virtually no music at all in the game, just ambient sound effects. in my mind this is just pure laziness. yes, no music gives an eerie atmosphere, but music can do so much more, and can create any kind of atmosphere you want to create, eg cave story. i suspect most people are rating this game highly simply because it's something different and unique, which is fine, god knows we don't need more call of duty's and battlefields, but please actually take into account other things apart from how unique the game is, especially as the majority of inde titles created have a unique aspect to it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-18,limbo is one of the best puzzle games released set in a dark and challenging world you will have to solve many thought provoking puzzles which will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. highly recommend
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-15,"there is nothing that could possible make this game any better, other than a cheaper price 15 seemed like a bit to much but the game play wow really gives meaning to the name limbo. the puzzles were really complex yet simple because they gave you all the pieces beforehand, introducing every new game element then giving it more depth, and combining with other elements. the game is designed flawlessly, i prefer quality over quantity compared to some other people but that's my opinion."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-12,"the gameplay is competent and tight and the aesthetics are brilliantly executed but i still can't shake the feeling that it represents the confusion on someone's part of fatalism with art. go ahead and ignore me though, i felt pretty much the exact same way about watchmen the comic."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-11,"great art, creepy ambiance, and physics puzzles that range from easy to having multiple parts. it is a rather short game, and i didn't ever think i would replay it after getting all the achievements, but i sometimes do. expect to die quite a lot while figuring out the puzzles, and in a rather gruesome way which i always cringe and close my eyes at, to be honest. the most satisfying part of the game is solving a difficult puzzle without looking it up on a faq. downsides? the storyline is lacking, and there isn't much to do once you've beaten it and gotten every achievement besides show it to friends and watch their reactions. otherwise, it's a great game. i don't think it's worth the 9.99, but it's certainly worth playing if you like puzzle games."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-07-06,"i played it non stop start to finish and enjoyed every single minute. amazing game in every way. the atmosphere, the level design, i hope to play more from this studio soon."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-11,"it's a brilliant game when it comes to artstyle  feeling. it has a unique story and is one of that kind of games that leaves you thinking about it for a long time. sadly, the controls with a pc sometimes can be very frustrating. but what disturbed me the most were the puzzles, which just needed timing, not thinking. in the last quarter of the game the solutions to the puzzles mostly are pretty obvious. however, you die too often trying out your solution, leaving you questioning is this the real solution? then you try something other until you came to the point when you realize that your first idea was the true one but you didn't perform it correct, which often depends on milliseconds. so the last puzzles drove me very angry because of that... but i realized that this don't destroy the whole game, which is  like i said  pretty awesome and inspiring."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-10,"a beautiful, artistic, game with a creepy but captivating atmosphere  definitely worth buying. i created an account on metacritic just so i could review this game! the graphics are all in black in white, done in the style of an old, flickering film. the difficulty level of the puzzles are just about perfect  just hard enough that they provide a rewarding challenge, but not so difficult that you start tearing your hair out. i only had to look up hints online about twice, and even then i had usually gotten the gist of the solution but just needed to be a bit more persistent. the creativeness of the puzzle mechanics is superb and makes for some very interesting interactions. one of my favorite things about the game is it's attention to subtle details in the physics of objects and little graphical flourishes that really make the experience rich and mesmerizing."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-05,"this game kind of makes me feel like i'm playing an old nes game but with better graphics and less fun 8bit music. its very simple mechanics make it quite an interesting game. you start off with no idea of what's happening, no back story, no one popping up telling you use teh arrow keyz to move. it just throws you in the game, basically telling you, you figure it out. you're smart, right? each time you fail a puzzle at first, you learn from your mistake how to go at it in a different approach. it's a fun little game that's a good game for reminiscing about simpler game times."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-05,"limbo is a wonderful game, with innovative scenery and an unique ambiance. the main dark point is the game is the lifetime is so short... you may clean the game in 23 hours nevertheless 23 hours of fun and reflexion!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-04,why does this game receive praise? i have no idea. it's bland and boring. the only thing this game has going for it is the cool graphics style. the controls are basic and glitchy. you can't even rebind the controls and the game forces you to use the arrow keys to move. no wasd. it's like the people that made this game never played a computer game in their life. no grahpics settings either. there's one action button that controls everything you do that isn't moving around. the puzzles are really basic and uninspiring until you get to the last 57 chapters of the game. the game is under 3 hours long and i ended up wishing it was shorter because of how boring it really was. there are some nice easter eggs hidden throughout the game which was nice to see. overall though it was a basic and boring puzzleplatformer. i don't recommend it.
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-04,"i'm going to get burned alive for this but this game is incredibly pretentious and boring. some of the puzzles have clever mechanics but so many of them are glorified trialanderror that you're essentially forced to die a few times just in order to figure out what it is you're supposed to do  it's artificial difficulty at its most blatant. playdead was obviously aware of this considering that despite how incredibly short the game was  at a stretch you'll complete the entire thing including most of the achievements within 34 hours and unless you're absolutely deadset on clearing off achievements tables there's no reason to play through it again afterward  there are checkpoints everywhere for when you inevitably run into a situation you can't possibly avoid dying from without knowing what to do beforehand. for such basic controls they're very sloppy when employed with a keyboard, especially late in the game when you start getting flipped around in all kinds of crazy directions. maybe the respond better with a gamepad, if so fair enough. the art style is okay, although playdead apparently can't resist the opportunity to cram in as many opportunities as possible to go hey, look at this grimdark subject matter in our game that we're never going to bother to even attempt to contextualize! see there are people hanging from a tree in a background, go forth and fill 50 pages worth of forum posts with your hipster friends about what freudian implications are being suggested! i get that people are for whatever reason getting a raging boner over how 'artsy' the game is, but it just comes off as pseudointellectual  put it just for the sake of getting people to overanalyze absolutely everything about the game. i guess if somebody can literally piss into a jar and have it be it art simply because the artist declares it so, why not limbo too? i got this as part of the humble bundle for a buck so it's not like i can say i was ripped off, but i'd have been very upset had i actually paid ten dollars for this."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-04,"infuriating and annoying, that's the only way to describe this game. some people clearly like that, but as the game progresses and the laggy controls start to have an impact on the game it becomes unbearable. there is a nice idea in here but the implementation on pc is just no good, maybe the console version was better and this is just a bad port."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-03,"this game does exactly what games are supposed to do, capture your imagination and play with it. the game does get a little drier by the end by it also finishes with an interesting proposal. and the music gives the game a symbiotic experience."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-02,"dull, short and easy. the sounds, although atmospheric, i felt added nothing of real value to the game, it may as well have been silent, the only saving grace for this game is the art direction. not worth the full retail price and i'm glad i got it in the humble bundle on the cheap."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"play the demo first! this game is literally so dry and boring that a five minute demo will simulate the entire experience. there are two mechanics to this game jumping and moving objects and they are so repetitive that the game almost plays itself. sure, the use of a physics engine adds a little something to the game, but it's almost entirely aesthetic. i will say that the artistic style is unique and the choice of having only ambient sound is interesting, but with no story to speak of the game simply isn't entertaining for more than twenty or thirty minutes."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"sadly, this game is an utter disappointment. when i saw the steam advertisements, i was expecting a dark work of art that would be engrossing as much in environment as in depth. this game fails miserably at both fronts, and i've been completely shot down with expectations for it. what others have said is entirely true  the game is far too short and overpriced even if you do enjoy it. while the art is fascinating initially, it quickly wears off after the first 20 or so times you  the first 10 minutes of the game. marketed as a puzzle platformer, its more like, surprise! you died! and now you can easily avoid the same trap thanks to you dying to see it. that is not a puzzle, and it ruins the sense of environment because you are staring at the same obstacle over and over again due to traps you couldn't possibly foresee. the puzzles aren't very creative, original or difficult, and dying over and over again from peekabooguaranteeddeath traps seems more like the developer sadism for no good reason. it does not give you the sense of environment, that the place is a dark hellhole and you should be afraid of it what i feel like would have been a far better approach...instead i found myself incredibly annoyed at repeated deaths over and over, disrupting my absorption of the presentation. when seeing corpses and such, instead of thinking, wow  was more like why is this stupid kid so damn slow. i stopped caring at all about the art and just remained focused on progressing, leaving me with halfassed puzzles to mow down. there really is no saving grace to this game. first half is the best half, and mostly lackluster after 30 minutes or so, while the second half tries harder puzzles and far more instantkill traps. gameplay is all about patience and timing due to the avatar's lack of mobility and fragility. i honestly think you could get a better game by roughly combining the game mechanics of portal 2 and doom 3 decorative carnage randomly smushed together with a random formula. not missing anything by passing this one up."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-20,"a short but pleasant experience. when i played it i couldn't help myself but think it could have been much more, but it stands good enough where it sits. there are many things that could be fixed though  a lot of puzzles require you to die first to see how it's solved, others are simply frustrating."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-18,"dark, dark game. in the form of classic platformer with a twist of puzzle. every time you solved a puzzle, you'll find yourself facepalming and saying damn! so that's how you solved the puzzle, and the solution is right in front of me. what really stands out is the graphics of the game. simple, yet somehow giving you that eerie feeling like whenever you walked in the dark. and whenever you accidentally killed your character, that little goosebumps always comes around. the ultimate downfall is the price and the length. for a relatively short game i finished it like in 3 hours or so, it's truly overpriced."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-04-30,"limbo is a relatively short but very worthwhile voyage. the game took me a little over 3 hours on first playthrough but for more casual gamers should last a little longer, then of course you can go for all of the achievements. from the beginning you are thrown into a very dark depressing place with no real understanding of why you are there not sure if this gets clearer really. the graphical style is beautifully creepy and the sound is second to none. play with headphones turned up loud to get every rain sodden footstep and every sickening thud of the bear trap severing you in two. the puzzles are quite challenging requiring both skill and thought, with a great sense of achievement upon completion. very highly recommended"
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-03-22,"i should not but i will. limbo got me  in and i really enjoyed the experience for the first 2030 minutes. then it started sliding and after i killed the spider, it pretty quickly got tedious. the game got a lot of the praise for the art style and again, it was fun to look at for the first 1015 minutes but then that too got a bit boring. it is not a bad game but it is not as great as people say. it was a good experience for the price so i still recommend it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-03-16,"limbo's design is an example of gaming as an art form. short and sweet, doesn't overstay its welcome. puzzles are challenging and fun, not illogical and frustrating i'm looking at you, braid. worth every penny of the 5 i paid for it during the steam holiday sale."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-03-13,"a piece of art. if someone was to tell me that a sidescroller would creep me out, i would not have believed them. great mechanics, incredible puzzles, great graphics and sound no music, just eerie sounds of your surroundings. the only knock on the game is the short length  about 2 hours, but the game offers high replay value  i have spent about 15 hours before i was able to beat the game without dying. regardless, gets a 9 since i was able to pick it up for 5, i think if i was paying 15 for it, i would have probably given it an 8."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-03-10,"everything was good from the beginning to the spider. than the game became bland and boring. the puzzles are uninspiring and the game drags on and on. people say the game is too short, i say the game is too long. i don't understand the praise this game recieves."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-03-08,"limbo is a beautiful, ambiancedriven side scroller everyone should play. the cost on steam is 9.99, a better value than a trip to the movies, and offers a few hours of unique, artsy entertainment. it isn't very difficult, but it sometimes makes you laugh and maybe think a bit. as others have said, sometimes you have to die to figure out how to solve a puzzle. with harder puzzles this would be a 9."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-03-06,"if you can pick it up for 23 bucks you owe it to yourself to play it. i doubt it will every crack anyone's top 10 list, but it's memorable and touching. keyboard controls all five keys work great."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"loved this game. it stuck with me so strongly, rainy days make me want to play it again. i also wish it had been longer, but that's my only complaint."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"i'll echo sentiments already written previously by  thank you!!! this game is trial by death, singlehandedly deriving the worst end case for a gamer into an endless roulette of repetition. i can appreciate the aesthetic choices made to this game, which is why it's not a total  gameplay always comes first, and it is simply. not. fun."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-25,"i just got to be a member to critic this game  what a bore. not a test of intelligence but your keyboard skills. the game is all about timing your jumps and holds. that's it. yes there are puzzles, but they are not that difficult, but only a matter of sequencing your key presses. if you don't you repeat it again. this is like a pinball with no colors and endless life. i think i got fed up with doing the same things over and over and timing my key presses. is this supposed to be fun? challenging your intelligence? or just an easy way to keep you busy and think as if you have accomplished something at the end? this type of gaming should end sometime because this is more like self torture rather than entertainment."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-24,this game is a polished diamond. it's nothing for hardcore nerds who play nothing but battlefield 3 and don't like to use their brains. limbo is a piece of gameart and should be treated like this. the optics athe sound designs are mindblowing. its easy to fall in love with that game very quick. everyone should have played this clever straight up jump and run thriller at least once. the only reason i didn't gice the game a full 1010 is because i reached the end after 4 hours. i didnt want it to end cause i liked what i seen.
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-01,"limbo is a good puzzle game. artistic and great environment, it still disappoint me a little bit to see little innovation in the mechanics. good and interesting puzzles is a strong point but its nothing really special. this game is worth the time to experience but only buy it when its on discount."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-31,"the artwork is quite nice and some of the puzzles were a bit challenging, but the game is pretty short. definitely not worth 10 for only a few hours of gameplay. also, the game can cause arachnophobia."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-30,"i suppose it's worth the sale price of 5 bucks, but not much more than that. it's very average. a lot of the game is simply dieing and then correcting the mistake you made that led you to die. i don't find it very entertaining. compared to braid, this game ."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-26,"limbo contains graphical, sound, and control details that give you the impression that a group of people have fussed over its smallest details for a very long time. the mechanics are tight, physics are well implemented, and the puzzles are cleverly designed. the only letdown was the brevity of the campaign and the fact that the storytelling is too spare to match the artistic potential of its monochrome visuals and haunting sounds."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-25,"this game is nearly priceless, its like a puzzleplatformer, horror, killing simulator mix that results in something extremely special and entertaining. not only do the black and white colors combine to make an excellent creepy atmosphere but the ways you die and the events that happen in the game create tension. the puzzles are pure quality, they are so good they nearly seem comparable to puzzles in valve games, and there is a lot of variety in each situation. my only complains with this game, the story is really not clear and some of the puzzles are quite difficult giving you many deaths. limbo is an amazing game which becomes challenging but not frustrating, this is one of my games of the year and a mustbuy title on any platform."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-22,"despite rendering in 2d and black  white, limbo features some quite disgusting content in many sequences. there are a lot of dead children and you must climb over them and drag them around. also if you are afraid of spiders, stay away from limbo. it has spiders lurking, chasing and killing you all over the place while you will cripple and kill them in return. if you don't mind those things, the game offers a unique, strong look and atmosphere with minimalistic but powerful sound. many puzzles are smart and fun, but some lengthy death sequences drowning takes up to 5 seconds become a nuisance when retrying a puzzle 10 times, which you will as they become very difficult as you proceed towards the end."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-21,"as many before me have pointed out, looks and atmospherewise this is quite a different experience to what else is out there. i'm not sure i particularly like it  relentlessly claustrophobic and grim. some of the puzzles are ingenious and others pretty straightforward  reminded me of braid a  became very frustrating to me in the latter stages as the loss of my hair will attest! deaths galore because of my inability to time the moves to perfection  i just ended up getting more and more irritated and eventually just watched the ending on a walkthrough video. it seems i did not miss a great deal. perhaps i just didn't have enough time to make the necessary corrections to timing  i was not after some super mario type challenges but instead something more cerebral and less punitive. unique design and mood but just too irritating for me to derive any pleasure from playing it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-17,"it is the strangest game i saw visually. really get an amazing and impressive artistic effect using black and white, with a very striking effect of fog. the sound section is impressive and very well managed, a quiet no music. with a bit of gore the strange deaths of the protagonist, a really weird story and a tremendously dynamic and original puzzles is achieved by creating limbo, a gem of indie games today. the only drawbacks are the length and replayability the only replay value you can get to take advantage is to get all the easter eggs, which are achievements for getting everyone, there is more than that."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-13,"beautiful. i did not expect much from limbo at first, what in my head was meh, another lazy indie puzzle game. but after i have played the game, i really like the black and white, very artistic. i played this game with my girlfriend besides me and guess what? we both enjoy it! solving the puzzle together and sometimes screaming together. good game and worth your time."
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-11,"very good quest look like another world. but i like limbo more  it puzzles hard but genuine logic, interesting and intriguing atmosphere, simple controls"
Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-01,"you know what annoys me about hard games like this, is that they believe they're tipping their hat to the nightmarish difficulty platformers of yesteryear. but what they fail to realize, is that back then, the difficulty levels were only hard to stop people from finishing a full price game in a short amount of time. nowadays, when i pay 10 for a game and find myself dying instantly every time i reach the end of the screen, i don't feel gooey nostalgia, but only bubbling rage. limbo is a game with such a mechanic, albeit a fantastic sense of design and atmosphere, but nevertheless let down by its complete lack of story, cheap sudden deaths and boring and repetitive physics puzzles. i swear that seesaw puzzles make their way into every single game with a basic physics engine and they have never been fun. it's unfair to rate a game down based solely off its difficulty and simplicity and all things considered, limbo isn't that bad. but it sure ain't as amazing as people make it out to be."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-29,"limbo is a 2d puzzlebased platformer with a dark and stylish mood. it offers a higquality casual gameplay, with well designed and non repetitive puzzles which will keep you busy for some time. the game in itself has a reasonable length, without the risk of annoying you too much. there is no frustration of trial and error, because most of the time you will respawn in a location in which you were a few seconds before you died. visuals are consistent through the whole game, even if the theme forest, underground, technology, ... changes the engine is very good, and even the overall feeling is perfect. just forget the plot which serves as a mere justification for you being there. being a singlesolution puzzle game, it has zero replayability. in conclusion, limbo is worth the money and, in general, is a very good game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-29,"a very unique  enthralling sidescrolling adventure that focuses on solving physicsbased puzzles to bypass hazards, and subsequently progress to the next area as you explore a dark  disturbing world. there is very little in the way of a storyline here the game description merely says that you are a young boy searching for your lost sister and it seems that it was purposely left vague to add to the intrigue and mystery. the meaning of the word limbo as we know it, is described as that of a place for lost souls, caught somewhere between heaven  hell. the overall atmosphere created is very well done and gives you a great sense of isolation  creepiness as you venture forth. in that regard, the ambient sound effects are all spot on and help set the mood. there's not much in the way of music, which actually seems to work out well because it might otherwise risk drowning out the sounds of the world that help create the atmosphere. graphicswise, limbo has a very unique  interesting style some would say bordering on art with its monochrome presentation and very dark foreground with somewhat lighter backgrounds for contrast. despite this, many of the death animations can be quite enjoyably gruesome and there is a good amount of visual detail in the world. for example, you can even see the blades of grass move as you run through them. some people will likely try to compare this game to braid, as they both have a sidescrolling platformer component but are puzzlesolving games at their core. i would say, however, that i found braid to be more difficult with its puzzles based on the manipulation of time, whereas limbo's puzzles involve more straightforward physics and are somewhat easier although no less enjoyable. still, you can expect some trial and error and many deaths experimenting and discovering how things work because you are never told or shown what to do or explicity explained anything. like braid, limbo is also somewhat of a short game and there really isn't much in the way of replayability aside from maybe doing a speed run or low death count run. the steam achievements add to the longevity a little bit, as do the ten secret eggs hidden throughout the world which once collected let you access a hidden bonus area with a difficult challenge, but don't expect to get more than 10 hours tops out of this game. in spite of that i would highly recommend limbo if you like games that involve thoughprovoking puzzles, simply because the experience is that fantastic while it lasts. the only negative things i can really say are that there is no volume control although the level seems to be good, the options are sparse, the controls can't be customized very simple game though, and gamepad support is limited to only the xbox360 controller. it would also be nice if the additional options stored in the  file you can turn on wasd controls there were added to the menu interface as well. these are all minor issues to be sure though, and don't really impact the enjoyment of the experience itself."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-28,"one of the best cheap games on steam. i was amazed at how i could be stumped by simple 2d puzzles. if the second half was as good as the first half, i would have given it a perfect score."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-26,"fantastic game that pleases immensely through its amazing art direction, eerie background music and imaginative and sometimes dark puzzles. a common criticism of this game is its length, one which i can't agree with. from beginning to end it's a brilliant game that hasn't filled itself with anything boring, mundane or less than amazing for the purpose of making itself longer. good value should be determined by quality, in which case, limbo is worth every penny."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-26,"beautiful and fun game. however, it is not worth more than 5. definitely worth the 2.50 that you pay on steam when it's on sale. definitely unique and dark, but loved the game all around."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-26,"this game is amazing, it manages a great level of difficulty, slowly increasing throughout the game, that many puzzle games don't find. puzzles were still of a decent difficulty at the start and gradually developed into taking 510 minutes to figure out each puzzle. while the odd few of the puzzles simply required jumping or running at the right time, most of them are well thought out and logical  unlike many other games where you feel that you never would have thought of the solution and ended up trying everything in trial and error. the atmosphere in the game is powerful, very creepy and i found myself genuinely freaked out at some of the things the boy encounters. checkpoints in the game are wellplaced so that you didn't have to repeat vasts amount of gameplay to get back to your origial point. the sound adds to the atmosphere, though a drawback is that you couldn't edit the volume in the options. while in hindsight i think that the story of his sister is a little underplayed, as even towards the end we don't really know what happened, while playing it didn't really occur as an issue and i found it fun watching the silent story of his journey unfolding. the game is relatively short 3.2 hours to finish or so, it is also very cheap."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-26,"lets look at it for what it is.... 2d platform game that is very cheap. i went into this game with low expectations and i must say, it blew me away. one of the best platform games i have played in a very long time. there was everything there while plying it, tension, excitement, frustration, sense of accomplishment. i would be jumping out of my seat in fear 1 min to looking at a puzzle i have no idea how to solve the next. the only way to describe it is perfectly simple and yet an engaging immersive scare game. the only let down for me was the length of the game and the fact that it isn't a very long game ofc depending on how long it takes to solve the puzzles i would definitely recommend this if you are a fan of a nice horrorpuzzle game that will keep you entertained and on your feet for the duration of the game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"limbo is a puzzle sidescroll game that's great. the gist is that you walk down a linear path solving puzzle along the way. the controls are as simple as you can get. use the arrow keys to walk and jump control key to 'use' switches, crates, and other things. most puzzles are satisfying and appropriate difficulty. the nice thing is that the puzzles vary throughout the game, keeping your interest. the artstyle is worth mentioning. the game is presented in a black and white style. with it's ambient music, it adds to the whole feel of the game. it took me about 3 hours to run through the game once with no knowledge of any of the puzzles. several steam achievements like finding hidden spots or beating the game with few deaths add to this time, but no more then 2 hours or so. overall for 10, 5 hours of great gameplay is definitely worth it. this is a must buy."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"wow this game is brilliant. who needs fancy 3d graphics? the game is simple, and the sounds with the darkness are definitely the games strong points! the puzzles are not to easy, yet you are also not going to solve it in a matter of seconds. it really makes you think, yet with so little controls you automatically know what to do. i was playing, and got to a certain point and was properly scared when you meet certain spiders  i don't usually get scared at games, but something just worked. i brought this game in the steam sale for 1.70, but after playing it  i'd of gladly paid the full price as well!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"creepy, fun, challenging. this game has some of the best atmosphere ever, but this is not a kids game as it has gore and plenty of ways that you die. overall i liked this game"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-20,"very few games out there that will get my girfriend to constantly peek over her book to check out my progress  this is one of them. dark and macabre, yet brilliantly simple. ok, i admit  some of the puzzles will have you pulling your hair out, but most of the time you can suss out what your poor little lost boy character has to do to navigate his way out of some kind of sick, twisted evil place. if you don't mind dying endless amounts of times, nor having any narrative or explanation as to why you are there, or indeed any help or pointers, this is a little gem  you should consider checking out."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-18,"limbo may be the creepiest game i've ever played, although i don't know if i'd call it fun. at times it's frightening, at other times it's frustrating. it doesn't help that the game is only a few hours long. limbo certainly has it's moments, but those are too few and far between for me to really recommend it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"this game is the most heavily overrated of the century. on most puzzles you are pretty much forced to die to figure out how to solve it. the only reason why this game takes 3 hours to beat instead of 1 hour is because the puzzles are 'haha you died, retry! in your face, and it is insulting. honestly making the puzzles 'hard' took little creativity whatsoever. the developing thinks they are being 'smart' but really there is no way we are supposed to know how to solve most of the puzzles without dying. you cannot even change the controlsresult of lazy programming. the spider part was literally the only part i enjoyed, and the atmosphere and sounds were spooky, that was a plus. the cool lightning effect could vary at least once in a while. seriously, it was not worth the 2.50 it was on sale for. this is not a troll post, or a hate post, i am being serious. i seriously had to quit in the middle of the game because it was so stupid and annoying."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-11,"limbo is one of those games that you finish quickly, but will stay with you for a long time. this game is the reason why i started to love indie games so much. the style, the atmosphere, the experience it's something you don't come across very often."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-11,"a very beautiful game, dark and poetic, simple et fun. it remembers me trine, with puzzles using physics and the 2d style. there are not many levels but they are stressing and various. it's a very little game, but very nice."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-10,"for the first 20 minutes or so of the game, i was very impressed with the atmosphere. i can certainly congratulate the people in the art department for creating that dark and eerie world. the gameplay however, was a bit disappointing. although some of the puzzles were very clever, most required me to die first just to figure out what i was being asked to do. sadly towards the end the gameplay becomes too repetitive, and for me this game has zero lasting appeal. i never want to play this game again after finishing the first run. the artwork in this game is truly amazing, but overall the gameplay is bland and there's not much to rave."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-06,"i was completely absorbed this limbo makes an atmosphere are dark, weird, sad and breathing. it's an excellent point that i can intuitively understand to run, jump, escape, pull, push before something do, in spite of i reached there and played for the first time. but it's only games the early stage. there is no difference between the free flash game like a puzzle action and this game of after the middle stages. i think the best way is this game get finished all too soon after hardly run, hardly escape, hardly find to the way that we have to go. i feel it doesn't match this atmosphere that i must stop to solve the gimmick. i forgot a main goal on the way. but... i hope no limbo 2 is made."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-05,"maybe it's because i'm a big brother, but i absolutely loved this game. the dark and fantastic art style fits perfectly with the simple story of a brother on a quest to find his sister, no matter what stands in his way. as other reviews have stated, the game isn't terribly long it took me a little over 3 hours to play through. at first the price seemed steep for so little content after playing through it i have completely changed my mind. the simple story, brilliant graphics and unique gameplay all came together to create something that transcends video games to become art. although i would categorize this as a puzzle game, it doesn't match up to traditional puzzle gameplay. progress in this game is based around trial and error and the frequent deaths that result. although this sounds terrible, the frequent save points for the most part prevent it from being bothersome. in fact, the experimental style adds more depth to the game as it so closely matches the approach a small boy on an adventure would take."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-03,"very simple and beautifully atmospheric platformer. it's definitely reminiscent of out of this world another world, though more fluid and less irritating. the visuals and the sound are done extremely well, while the puzzle solving varies from fun and novel to a bit irritating at times."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-01,"a wonderful puzzle adventure that lacks a proper story to back it up. the grainy, monochromatic video presents an eerie ambience in that quiet, but deadly place they call limbosomewhere between life and the afterlife. the puzzles are well thought out and not overly difficult, but the price of failure is death and that price will be paid often. short and sweet, limbo is certainly worth a look."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-01,"i've a problem with this game.visuals are great, art design as well. moody graphics, sounds, eerie atmoshere  it all works very well. in the other hand, limbo is short... and most of all  not even challenging. you'll need about 35h to beat it from start to the end, depending on you how easily you get frustrated. limbo constantly pushes your poor character to.. die. in your first playthrough there no chance to predict what obstacle awaits you. most of the times, you die... and with the new knowledge start from the nearest checkpoint. i guess it's not the way the platformer game should work... and believe me, most of the tasks are rather easy to perform, when you know how. in conclusion, limbo is a perfectly designed game... but it's better to watch than to play. i've enjoyed the gameplay, but overall im disapointed. nevertheless, game deserves at least 6 points. i had a good time... but i guess only once, there's no need to play it again."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-27,"wonderful game. a great example of how a video games can truly become a art. the puzzles are great and not too frustrating, and always keeping it original. the sound matches well the atmosphere. it's simply a beautiful game for people that can appreciate a game not just for the high paced action element."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-27,"artistically great and full of nice, original puzzles. it's logical in that you can analyze a level and figure out what to do. and it's very creepy, with a nice dark sense of humour. one of the best games i have played."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-27,"this game is pretty good but its far from being a master piece. as it is its a decent 2d platformer with some interesting puzzles. there are some major flaws with this game in my opinion first of all there is just not much to it. if you read the description your searching for your sister but in the game their is no story whatsoever not even a single message so you have to pretty much read the store page description to understand whats going on. it was also somewhat confusing when i first started playing on the pc because there was no tutorial what so ever and the sad part is there are only 5 buttons 4 of which are arrow keys used in the game so a tutorial would have taken 3 secs. i enjoyed the first 10 or so level of the games because it felt like a interesting world with dark forest, monster spiders, and fellow children. however about halfway through the game all other forms of life disappear and you are left with somewhat boring mechanical puzzles which serve no other purpose then to make you spend more time in the game. the end of the game just reaffirmed my belief that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life it was very subtle and i did not receive the boss battle hard puzzle i was hoping for. the end cut scene was also very weak and had no emotional impact on me whatsoever the previous hour of mechanical puzzle solving left me completely numb and i just wanted the game to be over. overall this game would have been great if it could have kept the feel it had for the first 10 or so levels but as it stands half the game is amazing and the other half is varies in quality from mediocre to mind numbingly meticulous. i'm glad i got it for 2.50 i would surely have been extremely disappointed to waste 10 on this game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-25,"yes, this game has eerie and beautiful visuals, but the trialanderror gameplay is simply too frustrating to warrant a higher rating. you'll have lots of deaths followed by how the hell was i supposed to know that would kill me? a clear games are art game, it priced too high, is too simple, and too frustrating for the average gamer."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-24,"this game is awesome... in the same spirit as braid, world of goo, etc... buy it.. you will not be disappointed! easy to pick up, simple controls, devilish puzzles, short and sweet, just the way i like my games"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-22,"i can't fault the game while you are playing it. it's dark, atmospheric and really is a game that engrosses, astonishes and flat out shocks. the only problem is that it's so short and when you finish, you are done. while it lasts though, it's experience that will stay with you for a very long time."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-10,"a simple puzzleplatformer with a good atmosphere. the start of the game was noticeably better than the rest, and the entire second half was just repetitive. it's alright, i guesss."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-10,"amazing! great atmosphere, reminds me of another world. my biggest criticism is that i just finished the game and only then when i noticed a headline in the steam news area for the game, did i realise that you can edit  to adjust resolution and use w a s d instead of the arrow keys. perfect game, all it needs is a decent settings menu."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-09,"ill give this game 3 points for the nice and refreshing  that was all the good that was there to say about it... lets start  1. this game costs 10 euros on steam, which is a pure disaster for a game that will enjoy you about 2 hours until youre finished, if you want something dark, play the binding of isaac 2. the puzzles are lame at best. some are pretty easy, and for some you just have to die to see how theyre being solved. thats all of the magic...i cant understand all the fuzz about the game, the graphics are nice,sure, but this game is not worth a metascore of 89 nor a userscore of 8.0, its worth to be categorized as a longer tech demo for a ridiculous prize"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-09,"limbo is the better indie game of the year, i love this game so much because if increlible puzzles and all the things thar envolved this game. and when we reached the end, going back to the beginning is amazing, defnitly i love this game!!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-01,"definitely not a feelgood game but nevertheless a visual and audio design masterpiece. it has some minor gameplay faults but the experience is driving, touching and draws you in. play in a darkened room with headphones."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-11-01,"quietly brilliant. it's a art masterpiece and a game designer school for those who like it. it's a perfect mix of puzzle, adventure and emotional gamming, with clever but not impossible challenges. highly recommend this for people who like adventure, puzzling, emotional games and stuffs like that. it's very beautiful too."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-31,"limbo is an intriguing platform game and is certainly worth a lookin. the style is excellent  black, white and moody. the puzzles are interesting and challenging. on the downside, it is short  expect to finish it in 2 or 3 hours. some people may find the lack of a story a problem, though for me that's part of the charm. who is this kid and why is he running through a dark forest? verdict  worth picking up for an afternoon's entertainment."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-20,"one of the best 2d platformer i've played since many years . it's simple , it's creative , it's gorgeous , it's masterpiece.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-07,"limbo is the gaming equivalent of 'designer' bottled water  the bottle is gorgeous, but you can get higher quality tapwater for a fraction of the price. limbo has absolutey excellent artdirection, and the entire experience is eerily beautiful. sadly, the game's selling points end there. the story is almost entirely nonexistent, and manages to wrap itself up after only 3 hours of game play. if it were a newgrounds title, all my 5 would belong to this. however, compared against other titles in the under 10 range, it leaves a lot to be desired."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-06,"spooky, scary, fun, worth much more than the price tag. this game is very fun and i enjoyed it thoroughly. afterward playing make sure you remember that real life is 3d"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-06,"quite simply the most astonishing 2d platform game ever made. perfect atmosphere, controls, atmospheric sounds, surreal game world  all in glorious black  whitegrey  white but it suits the game mood perfectly. a glorious game which puts gameplay first  drops the player into a beautiful but violent world in search of his sister. for the price on pc its a must buy even if you will only get 34 hours out of it on the intitial playthru striving to complete the game with less than 5 deaths to unlock the bonus level will take a lot longer!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-05,"tip top! fantastic visuals, dark humor and fun puzzles. wonderful. it's not often that a game comes along that just makes your day happier and more enjoyable. limbo does that in spades."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-10-04,"yes, the game is damn short you can make it in about 3 hours, but it's not the length or replayability that makes this game fascinating. it's the atmosphere and art that count. with every puzzleish game, once you know the solution, you won't forget it anymore. but while you're still on it, it will bind you to the screen, make you want to go on, escape, find the boy's sister. the way they ended the demo alone was making me want to continue right away. the game captured me in about half an hour of playtime. the puzzles themselves are varied, and you won't feel like you've done this or that before. you'll have to run for your life more or less constantly, it will keep you on your toes. at 3 hours of playtime, you can say that it's about 3 an hour. is the game worth that? yes it is. play it at night, sit down, relax, and let the game get to you. don't resist the chills. this game is worth your while."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-30,"i was firstly enthralled by the gruesome solutions to the puzzles at the start of the game, but then quickly grew bored of repeatedly dying and having to complete timing challenges over and over after which i was greatly snubbed by how poor the ending was. i paid 7 for this game. it wasn't worth the money."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-29,"i really don't understand why everyone is calling this game a masterpiece. the graphics are unique and they work. the puzzle solving is pretty clever but it's nothing special. the sounds work for the game but there really aren't any. there's no music throughout, only ambient sounds here and there. the game is fun and surely worth playing but even at the low price of 10"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-22,"atmospheric, clever and  controls are tight and it makes a nice use of physics .it requires quick reactions, and you will die a lot, and the game is based on learning from your mistakes.a forgiving checkpoint prevents the game from getting frustrating a great game overall."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-21,"i possibly can't tell the atmosphere of this game with words, yet i have to write something about it. it is a short game and this is the only flaw. however, its puzzles are highly original. visuals and main character is so dark, and the deaths are so cruel, you start wondering if it may be the darkest game you have ever played."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-17,"limbo offer a great puzzle game with good idea and interesting graphics. the game is not to easy and some puzzles will take some time to do. most of the time doing a mistake result in you dying and start over from the last checkpoint. but i never felt that as a problem. limbo is not a very long game, depending on how much time you spent on the puzzlesaround 34 hours. you may squish some extra hours trying to get all achievements. music is semipresent in the game but it does an awesome job setting up the mood. if you are a fan of puzzle games, i say try it out, you will not be disappointed."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-16,"i think it's better if i start with the downsides. this game is relatively expensive and way too short for 10 euros. but i just couldn't wait till it's price goes down. i did not regret this purchase. first of all it has a really strong atmosphere which  one in immediately. this game is a good example of art meeting a mainstream medium. i really liked the creatures, enemies and the numerous unique gameplay elements. it's certainly more than a puzzle platformer. the challenges aren't frustrating, because you don't have to repeat long sections of the game to get to the actual obstacle. the puzzles are not too hard, but there are some more complicated ones, which require some brain capacity. the presentation is plain perfect. the minimal graphic design, the creepy soundtrack, the physics and the gameplay are all polished to perfection. i can only recommend this game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-16,"from start to finish it's a really well designed game. the black and white art style looks great and the game has a genuinely creepy feel, although i'd be hesitant to call it art. the puzzles and platforming are really solid and will test you brains, and later on your reflexes as well. some of the puzzling reminds me a little of ico on the ps2 in a way. my only fault with the game is that it's extremely short, perhaps even for the relatively low price. still, it's good from start to finish  worth playing in my opinion."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-15,"great platformer with great visual style and gameplay, which makes love itself from the very first minutes of play. and that's great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-13,"an absolutley thrilling game.. the the monochrome graphics  physics are very clean. the controls are simple yet fun. good job! sometimes simple is just better. i gave it a 9 because i was unable to upgrade the demo to a licensed version, a slight graphics handling error, but had no effect since the full version is available."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-10,"this is a really fun and beautifully designed game yet it has some serious flaws. first off, it's way too short, even for a budget title. after beating the game, steam had my playtime logged at 69 minutes. that means this game actually costs more to play per minute than your typical bloated. bigbudget title. my biggest complaint about professional and amateur reviewers is that they pay so little attention to cost. the professionals get the games for free, so i guess they have an excuse. but it is an important consideration. this is a good game but only for a much lower cost. i would price it at 5.00. another factor relating to cost is that it has virtually no replay value. but that is typical for puzzle games. the other serious flaw is that many of the puzzles are entirely unsatisfying. you might think you are solving puzzles at first but at some point you realize you are just taking shots in the dark. some of the puzzles are not possible to solve until after you've died at least once. my favorite part of playing a puzzle game is trying really hard not to die the first time. this doesn't happen often, but i just feel deflated as soon as i realize there was no way i could have solved it the first time no matter how carefully i thought it out beforehand. you can tell how good a puzzle is by how high you throw you hands up in the air once you finally solve it or are told the solution and say, ah, jeeze! how did i not see that to begin with? it's so obvious now! many of these puzzle will just leave you shrugging with indifference making this game more of a metaphor for life and perhaps the afterlife than i would care for. but it is still a fun game. it just doesn't live up to the absurd amount of hype buzzing around it. i would give it a much higher rating if the price were much lower."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-09-05,"the people giving this game 8 are giving it for the novelty of the game, not for its actual value. here's my take on the good and the bad everyone will like good eerie visuals and sound make an excellent atmosphere, some of the puzzles are creative. some will like gruesome and gory deaths, horrific enemies, a few gross puzzle solutions what makes this game  very short, not worth 10, should be 5 at the most. i finished it in 34 hours. over half of the puzzles require you to die at least once to see how to solve them robs you of ever feeling like you are smart and adaptive when you have to die to say oh yeah, thats not going to work!. half the puzzles arent even puzzles, they are just idiotic reflex  timingjumping challenges. summary nice idea, failure in execution making this game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-31,"i loved everything about this game. i cant believe some of the bad reviews on here, they either belong to a lame gamer, or to a !!!. the game is awesome. i swear its a great game. it is a must to have lol."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-30,"i wish so much they didn't try to attempt any narrative. the game's fun and challenging. i do agree with others that in many lategame instances, you do have to die to figure out how you're supposed to solve the puzzle, but this is excusable. the film noir aesthetic is beautiful and immersive.  but after finishing the game, i felt cheated more than ever before. the game keeps hinting at a narrative  that the game's making some type of commentary on... something. it seems to really be trying at some points, but at the end, nothing really makes sense. nothing is explained, and there's not enough of a coherent story to make interesting theories on like in braid. after finishing, i ended up scouring internet forums looking for someone to enlighten me. instead, i found some of the most frustrating nonsensical drivel i've yet read. it was confirmed to me that while limbo's creators made some attempt at a narrative, there was nothing substantive. seriously, i'm not ocd, but the game's lack of a story rips a huge hole in an otherwise brilliant indie game. but.... with most games pretending even harder to have a story and failing equally hard at six times the price, i can't give limbo a bad rating. in the end, it's a great, enjoyable, rewarding puzzle game great for nighttime play."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-28,"there have been 3 games released this year which i played to completion whereas i have started many many more. the 3 games this year have all dragged me in and i have thought of pretty much nothing else while playing them. i would go to work and my mind would be on them and not what i was doing. i would be trying to sleep and i would be thinking about what i had been doing in the game and what could be next. the games were portal 2, limbo and from dust. all puzzle games but all totally different and equally amazing. with limbo it starts you off nice and gently but like all good games the further you get in the harder it gets. some puzzles you could work out as you see them on the screen but some too ages for me to figure out. when you get to a bit you get stuck at limbo does end up like a slow motion super meat boy, but that's ok. there is not much of anything to the game, not much of a story boy enters limbo to save his sister, not much music, just atmospheric noises, not much graphics greyscale all the way through. not much in the way of controls and not much in the way of instruction... but limbo needs none of this to drag you in and absorb you. the developers got this all just right. reading the couple of bad reviews one of the things i noticed was someone complaining that there is no replayability for him. what i would have to say to anyone worrying about that is the game cost 6.99 and i played it to completion. i have a stack of games i paid 30 each for that are sat there installed, played for an hour and i have no desire to go back to. limbo is great value for money when you look at it like that. i played this to completion over a few days and wanted to play nothing else while doing so. i would give this a 9.5 out of 10, but metacritic limits us to whole numbers so i went for 10. the reason i would give 9.5 and not 10 would be for how short the game is, sure, it's great value for money  but i want more! if limbo 2 came out today then i would buy it in a flash. the other reason it doesnt get 10 is the ending of the game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-26,"a delightful little platformer, which is now easily accessible to pc users via steam. limbo does a great job of combining challenging 2d platform gameplay with a unique artistic style that sets a very eerie. the result of this blend makes for a game experience that can be frustrating, but one which lets you dive into the strange world that has been created. game mechanics are smooth, but can be unresponsive at times i.e. sliding down ramps, jumping to a platform that is just within reach, if timed correctly. these issues do not hinder gameplay, though, so are very minor. the lack of music leaves the player to experience the sounds of limbo, which, in some cases, are the only clues you have on how to solve certain puzzles. overall, limbo is a great value for 9.99. those who complain about the replayability or length of the game are just crazies who don't understand that you will not get a 2040 hour game at this price level from an indie developer. do yourself a favor and buy this game. you will be glad you did."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-22,"really loved the atmosphere. it starts as a simple platform game, but the difficulty increases quickly and reaches a quite tough level at the end. but what makes limbo so particular is the way the levels are presented to the player there is no real separation between them, they are all in one big sized level. one thing i regret is that the story could have been a little bit more detailed than that. after knowing most of it, i felt that something was missing maybe an explanation or some sort of conclusion... besides that, the player is constantly pushed further and the will of knowing more never leaves your mind. additionally, there are some very cool achievements to get, and even a bonus one that you may find by completing the others. getting that last one is an adventure by itself, but i won't say why to avoid spoilers."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-21,"lovely game  very pretty and quite original. the puzzles are hard enough to challenge you, but not so hard that you have to google the solution. it's short completed in a few hours and limited replay, but definately worth playing..."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-20,interesting platformpuzzled gameplay. it was fun while it lasted super short. i did have a problem with the storytelling portion. the game gave no background of what was going on except for the game details in the steam store. there was no cutsceneintegrated method of telling a very simple story.
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-20,"one criticism level 35 is not very fair in terms of a logical puzzle. i won't spoil, but i had not needed to look up the solution until level 35 when i couldn't solve it. the button pushing block lifting off screen is not clear at all even when you know how it's solved, it doesn't make much sense. i don't think many people will solve it, some will solve it by accident but not know what they did. apart from that, great art and design. small footprint. excellent sound design, character control and environment animations. smooth gameplay, no interface distractions, just the game with minimal controls and subtle but detailed levels."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-19,"an excellent 2d puzzle and platformer, wrapped in an intriguing horror game. the graphics really set an atmosphere, the puzzles never get too frustrating, the controls are very responsive, and it only uses one sentence for a story. no dialog, no textexcept for a big sign saying hotel, nothing except environment sounds and a static noise. the only reason why this does not get a 10 is because of its extremely short gameplay25 hours.."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-19,"could be considered art then this is it! 1010 for style and presentation and i loved playing it. i'm giving it 610 for three reasons. firstly and perhaps predictably, it's too short. secondly, and perhaps this is why it's too short. if you're, let's say, more of a mature gamer like i am and have been around since the dawn of gaming, then the puzzle aspect of this game is just too simple. i have to stress however that this does not take away the enjoyment of basically controlling an excellently animated, very intriguing character, in a feature length cartoon. the third reason for the controversial rating is the replayability, for me is nil. a bit like watching a christmas movie, maybe i'll play it watch it again in a few years but that's it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-18,"artistically gorgeous from the beginning from the beginning to the end. it's a really nice and deep experience and i liked the storyline. or at least what i managed to understand by my concept. its a bit short but it doesn't really matter, this game is absolute gold and definitely one of the most amazing indie games i played in 2011."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-17,"this game is a  of game industry!! personally i watched a walkthrough on youtube first i was really  in like it was a movie then tried it my self, certainly like others said the puzzles are getting harder and harder but what a pleasure for like 10.. a must try if it reminds you of your childhood! a must have if you're an emo p jokes"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-15,"put simply, limbo is a magnumopus of game design. it demonstrates the viability of the digital platform and adds further substance to the hackneyed argument of videogames as art. light yet brainy puzzle platform gameplay is applied to a canvas of delightful physics and wrapped in unwavering and meticulous attention to detail. the environment and backdrops are fluid and smoothly integrated, affected by the physics system which itself is consistently drawn upon for what are perhaps some of the most incredibly clever puzzles in a video game. your intuition is not merely put to the test, but violated, and it is this continual cleverness, combined with amazing polish, that allow limbo to rise above as part of the cream of indie development. from start to finish, you are involved and intrigued, but never frustrated by the ample number of deaths, or overly horrified by the atmosphere, inhabitants or puzzles. perhaps limbo's only downfall are the controls, which on the pc are onerous at times, and noncustomizeable. periodically, limbo's brilliant manipulations extend to your keyboard, both a blessing and a curse, but not at all detrimental to the overall experience. in the end, you will want to forgive limbo for its shortcomings, and i suggest you do this is a classic."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-15,"amazing! great atmosphere, reminds me of another world. my biggest criticism is that i just finished the game and only then when i noticed a headline in the steam news area for the game, did i realise that you can edit  to adjust resolution and use w a s d instead of the arrow keys. perfect game, all it needs is a decent settings menu."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-12,"i hope edward gorey's spirit is looking down or up and smiling at limbo because it reminds me of something he would concoct to run annoying children through. tons of nihilistic style and enjoyably difficult, this 2d platformer demonstrates how much dark fun you can have with simple yet well thought out game play. expect to die... a lot. exploration can be cruel and frustrating, the death's are disturbing, yet the game's rewarding. if i have one complaint it's that i wish limbo was much longer, but this bleak dystopia is well worth the tiny price."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-09,the only thing i have against the game is the length... finished it in a little under 3 hours. it should have been much longer for the asking price or extend it via updatesdlc like angry birds or cut the rope.
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-08,"absolutely beautiful, hypnotic and charming. a bit challenging but mostly easy not easyboring though. a pleasure to play and a pleasure to feel as an experience beyond a game. if it were just a little longer..."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-08,"this game managed to have me grossly frustrated yet enthralled, which is a very unique feeling. the controls are very smooth and the setting feels unique. sadly it seems shallow and leaves too much for the imagination a quality not always wanted in a game. halfway through i just started looking forward till the end thinking surely something epically grand will happen soon!, but either i don't get it or.. well. it's grossly overrated, though, i'll say. it's a good game and all, but how can people be that blown away by it? i'd definitely recommend it to anyone play this game, dude, it's awesome!, but not much more than that."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-08,"you must die to see how to do the next puzzle! honestly, the game have a very brilliant graphics, nice physics and is very scary. after an hour of playing, the game become very hard and is really frustrating to do next puzzles. in most cases you have to die to know how the puzzle can be solved."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-07,"turning the limitations of a small indy game into a strength, limbo is short but fun, has a memorable art style and is a must play downloadable game. the visuals of limbo are simple and effectively create an eerie atmosphere better than most aaa video games. the game play is simple but adequately fun, the game physics are great and there are some memorable little game moments found in limbo. less can be more which is a lesson that the rest of the industry should learn. recommended."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-07,"a very unique game that at 9.99 is worthy of its high praise. it offers a very dark and moody style with nuanced audio that compliments the nature of its puzzles. the game does not seek to thrill you with graphic intensive visuals, instead it focuses on emphasizing the experience by making the puzzles completely immersive. the puzzle where your center of gravity is being turned 360 degrees over and over is a perfect example of this. the story of the game provides a backdrop to the puzzles but it really is not what the game is about and i think those that criticized the game for lack of a more complete story didn't get what the game was going for. this game is really a dark fairy tale told in a very creative way. overall the game is of course a side scrolling platform and while it is extremely well done and successfully revives the genre i cannot give it higher than an 8 for the fact that it is not perfectly original and it is a little short. it is however a very well spent 10. here's to hoping we will get a full length sequel to compliment this exceptionally well made game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-07,"very strange game, but worth trying if you have access to a demo. it's very simple with only leftright movement and one jumpclimb button. i think the atmosphere is really what makes it stand out from anything else. i've heard it's pretty short, but i felt it was well worth the 10 after playing the steam demo. i look forward to seeing what's in store for this odd, lost little kid in limbo."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-06,"it's really  is simple but very enjoyable.i think it should have been longer.there are quite differents from other puzzle  don't use just machines,you can also use nature to solve  graphics are worth to see,character is small and 's one of the best puzzle games i've ever played."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-06,"amazing! absolutely amazing, one of the best platformers of 2010 finally finds its way to the pc gorgeous black and white graphics, a strong sense of desolation and well thought puzzles make this one an eternal classic."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-06,"here to remind us that gameplay matters more than story for a game to work, is limbo. 3 controls make it simple, but the puzzles intrigue you and the darkness and silence captivate you into a world that needs no narration or text. its beautiful, just difficult enough to enjoy but not enough to frustrate you, as they give you hints on how you're supposed to proceed. there was next to no puzzles in which you had to die in order to know what to do. i could go on and on but this game is as near to being perfect as you can get, so it deserves a 1010."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-05,"i appreciated this game a lot, it has an amazing mood and it doesn't try to drown you in it with music or hide the lack thereof with music. the little things were what impressed me most, small details in the world you could and sometimes must pick up. parts of the 'story' you could piece together by just being attentive. the one problem with the game is length and replayability. i could imagine if you were to play through it a second time you could be more appreciative of the surroundings and what is going on i didn't realize a certain detail of the game until i started a second time. the problem is, with today's audience it seems everyone just wants to win, they don't bother with the details and if they get stuck it's straight to youtube for the walkthrough, a great game that i fear may go less appreciated than it deserves."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-04,"fantastic, fantastic game! it's sorta like a braid game, but limbo tells a story without ever saying anything. the gameplay is condensed into four directional buttons up being jump at every appropriate moment and one action button. it's amazing what it's able to accomplish with so few and that is one very atmospheric puzzler. in all honesty, aside from the game play and puzzles, limbo is all atmosphere. from the moment the game starts we are already playing, given no obvious cues and expected to learn as we go. if you read the sales page, you probably already know you're looking for your sister in limbo. and honestly, that's all the information you'll be getting on that front. there are a lot of blanks, and as the player you're left to assume what it all means and how it relates into a story. if you pick up on the visual ques, i believe there is one dramatic story being told here. at any rate, i was going to give this game a 910 because it seems to be having some issues with my rumblepad got it sorta fixed, but it's not a perfect solution, but honestly i'm sure the issues will be fixed down the line otherwise the keyboard controls are quite doable. 1010, another great example of how video games can be executed as an art form!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-04,this game is very interesting because is like machinarium where you must to logic the ways of life of the little boy limbo.
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-04,"great game! very unique and the puzzles are fun to figure out. i beat it in maybe 3 hours, so in terms of playtime it is pretty short. i would have loved to see them incorporate some more game play elements into the game. very much a ragdoll puzzle game in the dark."
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-03,"i created a metacritic account just because i feel this game deserves as much praise as it can get. original, good atmosphere, played it through straight to the end. short, but sweet  we need more original thought like this in games. proof that you don't need to set your video card on fire to get some good entertainment"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-03,"a full 10. there isn't even a question about this. this game felt like i was playing a work of famous literature. there are challenging puzzles that really give you a sense of accomplishment once you complete them. for this alone, i caution anyone against looking up walkthroughs online. i looked up the solution to one of the first puzzles, and then was disappointed in myself for doing so. i strongly urge you to do your best to solve the puzzles on your own. the animations are wonderful and fluid, the monochromatic aesthetics are appropriately haunting and beautiful. this game is an absolute work of art, and will go down in history as one of the finest games ever made. one last note to anyone griping about the story, let me remind you that this is an intentionally minimalist game. one would think you'd get that impression just by looking at the lack of color in the world. it is almost without form. it is void. it is, quite dramatically, limbo. consider the very nature of what the word means when you reach the ending,"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-03,"amazing. simply... amazing. i was thrilled throughout the whole game! the atmosphere is mystical, dark and scary, which fits perfect with the puzzles. the only downside is the game's length.. but i'm more than pleasantly surprise with this game. i've never played anything similar the feeling of controlling the boy around just can't be compared to anything else. it's newthinking, beautiful, exciting and gives you the chills! this game is perfect"
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-03,let me preface this by saying the gameplay of limbo was good. the game took full advantage of the 2d platformer genre. the downside to this game however is the lack of a coherent story. making a story vague to the point where players have to keep guessing as to what it's about doesn't exactly make it good. with limbo it was almost as if the developers hired jonathan blow and told him to write a story behind kazimir malevich's black square.
Puzzle,Limbo,2011-08-02,"simple and brilliant. the result of game  art. game mechanics is great and it's mood quite unique. puzzles are quite easy but since mistakes often means death and restart, that's a good thing, to avoid them into become annoying. checkpoints are well and often placed. it somehow reminded me of out of this world wich is a game i loved. game sound is also amazing, focused on details and ambience with no music, making it's dark mood even more creepy. the weakest point is the game lenght... quite short... they could've made the game a little bigger, with harder puzzles near the end, but for 10 bucks it's more than worth it."
