Henrytas,2025-01-22,90,"Sin duda se trata de uno de los juegos que marcaron tendencia, siendo infinidad de veces copiado, aunque rara vez superado. Se trata de un juego simple y minimalista, con un apartado sonoro austero (s√≥lo hay sonido ambiente) y unos gr√°ficos detallados, pese a ser 100% monocromo. El juego cuenta con puzles de dificultad creciente, llegando a ser un tanto frustrantes en la recta final, aunque no se puede decir que sea injusto, ya que todos tienen **** peque√±a joya que me hizo descubrir que se puede disfrutar con los juegos indies de corta duraci√≥n, m√°s incluso que con las grandiosas superproducciones AAA"
CharliezardLaw,2025-01-11,70,"Um jogo legal, sem d√∫vidas, e sua originalidade nem se fala, por√©m, acaba ficando massante os quebra-cabe√ßas e o jogo n√£o prende muito. Demorei meses para terminar, pois acabava n√£o tendo vontade de voltar para terminar."
Magenta_black,2025-01-09,80,"Atmosfera t√©trica, los puzzles estuvieron bien aunque algunos pocos no ten√≠an sentido, no tiene m√∫sica, pero hace un trabajo excelente con el sonido."
JonatanRiver,2025-01-02,80,"Muy lindo juego. Corto, pero muy bueno. Tuve qeu bsucar explicaciones sobre el lore."
basic12345,2024-12-31,90,Simple but great. The game really suprised me. The graphics are minimalistic and there is no speech but the atmosphere is awesome.
brunonp_,2024-11-10,80,Super entretenido para los amantes de los puzzles. Prefiero igualmente a INSIDE antes que LIMBO pero sigue siendo un muy buen juego que vale la pena.
zyllus,2024-11-06,80,"Its not a game, its frustration simulator. At times the game gets so frustrating, some of the puzzles are ridiculous."
-Phoenix-,2024-08-17,100,"This game definitely knows how to make a player want more; you just want to keep going. Playdead is one of the best companies in this style. You feel Limbo's loneliness. I think his desire is not to find someone to get away from here, but mostly to find someone to not be alone anymore. He isn't afraid of dying. He doesn't know where he is or why he is here, and this fact makes him want to find someone more and **** may be said that it has no story, but I can't agree with that. It just hasn't been taught fully and lets the player find and connect pieces and add a bit of their own imaginary. The game's achievements are as interesting as the game itself. Some of them are easy, some of them are hard. I had so much fun while doing ""DING!"" achievement. I would definitely recommend this game."
ODI_,2024-05-31,80,"what an excellent puzzle game, with very simple horror style, but there is some puzzles that aren't clear enough, other than that its gonna be top 5 puzzle games in my opinion"
Gvneshv,2024-04-04,80,"A very unique, pretty, and beautiful puzzle platformer. Despite its simple graphics, it's still gorgeous. The gameplay is meditative and some puzzles are quite tough which makes the game more interesting and remarkable."
Jackabs,2024-03-15,80,"Some game mechanics, you can figure out if you've played other games in the past. eg. Duration it takes when the worm causes confusion to the boy. ‚ùñ Puzzles are satisfying to solve, frustrating when you can't figure it out. ‚ùñ Hollow Knight-like atmosphere. ‚ô™ Try playing another music if you're not feeling horrorish. ‚ô™ íÄ≠Get prepared to say omoshiroi in your mind a number of times. íÄ≠"
RustY420,2024-02-18,60,"Its alright. Kinda waited for more honestly. I was expecting more interaction whit the people, the ending was epic."
Markltv,2024-01-27,80,"Maybe not as impressive as Inside, but still such a quality product with a nice plot."
Younix,2023-12-18,80,"This game is really interesting. The art direction is superb, and definitely fits what this game is going for. The music and sound effects also really hit the nail on the head. It's calming, but you know you don't want to be here. I also think that this is really eerie. Not scary, or disturbing, but eerie. Like you've walked in on the aftermath of something. The spiders are also really intriguing, and a staple of the game. It is quite difficult, and somewhat repetitive throughout, but I really love this game."

DURISTIKA,2023-10-21,70,"I can't say that I really liked the game, it clearly doesn't deserve an eight on metikritika and there are reasons for that. The game positions itself as a puzzle, but personally for me there were at most two moments that I really thought (dumb). It's a weak puzzle game. The game is pretty fast, you don't have time to enjoy it. The setting of the otherworld and traveling through it didn't impress me much for some reason, I don't know why. On the plus side, despite the fact that it is a platformer and also quite casual, gameplay. For five buttons it is diverse. Unusual in a good way style, and also very relaxing forest audio, I would listen to it just so. Overall I think I would rate Limbo a 6.5 out of 10."
Deez1718,2023-10-16,70,"if you're fun of the genre, you definitley have to try limbo, if you haven't played any game of this genre, you definitley have to start with limbo. Higly recommnended"
Animus_V0x,2023-10-16,80,"Very short dark game, just like Inside. Easy to play, hard to master (way too hard, if you want the 100% success). But with a deep story that is never really explained but somehow is captivating, even if gloomier as fugg."
connor_888,2023-10-05,60,a strange and interesting game

Saume,2023-09-25,60,"It's a fine platformer. This game is mostly an experience and is not so much about the gameplay or mechanics. As such, this is less my style. I didn't hate it, but I have no intention of replaying it or similar games."
OniGioRi,2023-09-07,70,Limbo is a puzzle game with its unique look. This game is really unforgiving so you have to be really patient and enjoy similar games to have fun. While the game is beautiful and entertaining it feels like there is no real idea behind it.
ekozcifci,2023-09-06,60,"Not great overall, bored in story. But as an indie, nice job. I dont like PlatformPuzzle type games but Visually almost perfect"
Richard_dias,2023-08-15,60,"I think that is an overrated game. Fortunately, PLAYDEAD improved a lot on INSIDE."
Topoide,2023-07-31,70,"No entendi mucho el juego, es entretenido lo corto que es pero con una historia nula y sin sentido"
Yabs,2023-07-30,90,Excellent plat-former & puzzle solver. I was quite engaged the entire way through. I really enjoyed the environment and the dark-comedy that the game presents. Highly recommended.
Uygurlu,2023-07-21,60,"I was so hyped before I play Limbo but as soon as I started to play I realized that this game is just another overrated indie only because its art style. Firstly, Limbo hasn't got a story, it just has a few scenes that are trying to show a story but they doesn't make any sense together. Especially the ending was just a meaningless 10 second scene. So it becomes impossible to make a connection with the game. Secondly, controls are so annoying and it makes you crazy. The character doesn't jump as I wanted or he doesn't hold as I wish. It feels like I'm not controlling him, the character does whatever he wants. Despite all this you can get entertained by Limbo's brilliantly designed puzzles. They can be really creative and difficult to solve. But one bad thing about the puzzles is they can be really cryptic and that's not good for me. Sometimes it becomes extremely challenging and i believe that %95 of the people can't finish this game without looking to a guide or walk-through video. Especially the secret level was that close to make me rage-quit. The soundtracks are also very bad chosen and there are music only in the 10 second ""storytelling"" cutscenes. Overall Good sides: Entertaining puzzles Good art style Sometimes fun gameplay Bad Sides: No story No soundtracks Bad controls Some over difficult puzzles"
abkh2000,2023-07-11,100,The game is so amazing and in every chapter there is new and different puzzle Without any word i enjoy the dark story and dark environment
Suprizer,2023-06-10,50,Really short cute little enjoyable game but there are others in same genre much better in my opinion such as FAR series.

Wiezzel,2023-04-23,100,"A true masterpiece in design. Really no way to describe it. It is the kind of games that seem simple but they will keep you going hard! Do not miss the chance to play this game. If you have the opportunity to grab it on sale or not, go for it. The kind of games you got to try to understand what people mean and know for yourself."
zaratti,2023-03-08,60,"Limbo is a very unique, abstract game that is very interesting to play. There's some good stuff here, the puzzles were often good and made me think and the graphics have a unique style which I enjoyed very much but the movement, story, some puzzles and sections of the game can all be confusing and annoying. First of all, the movement. You can't use the arrow keys to move and controlling the character sometimes feels clunky. Missing jumps because you didn't get the exact timing right, doing trial and error just to accomplish basic tasks isn't enjoyable. The story of the game is way too vague, it feels like it's trying to tell a story but that's not the focus at all. Normally, abstract storytelling is my kinda thing but it just doesn't work when it's this vague. Some puzzles are also annoying to deal with. Some puzzles mess with your movement and a lot of them require precise jumps which, as I mentioned before, isn't the easiest thing to figure out in this game. In it's core, I think this is a good experience but it definitely has a lot of flaws."
staxhinho,2023-02-17,90,A very good puzzle game that gave me several moments of anger and happiness.
aligunes,2023-01-31,60,"This is a really fun and beautifully designed game. The puzzle solving is pretty clever. There's no music throughout, only ambient sounds here and there. This can be called a short and different experience."
Dco326,2023-01-20,100,"Zanimljiva, nista nije pretesko bas kako puzzle game i treba da bude ne traje dugo pametna stvarno sve naj svaka cast ko je napravio :) e znam da li bi opet igrao nema taj WOW faktor ali je stv top"

clem666,2022-08-23,80,"A great story to be interpreted. The dark and silent ambiance is just terrific. Puzzles requires some reflection. Music is gorgeous. The environment is highly stylish, and there are numerous moments where you can feel how small and sickly the character is. Boss fights are epic. Lighting is terrific. If the game definitely is quite short, the eggs to collect and the achievements to get manage to make it last a bit longer. You certainly should be okay to die a lot to understand all the traps of this game. In a sense it may seems like a die & retry kind of game. I am very aware that 'Limbo' has something of really empty and hollow. Nevertheless I can't deny that I have been stuck in its universe and atmosphere all throughout. Must test."
KisatS,2022-08-19,100,"This game was a present for my birthday, I didn't expect that I'll become addicted to this fabulous indy game. Sure 6 y.o. I wasn't too good at puzzle games but the atmosphere and the environment confused my mind. Even though, till this day I'm still playing and reminding myself that I had the best gaming experience ever."
