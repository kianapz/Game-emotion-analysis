"Limbo is a timeless indie masterpiece that redefined the puzzle-platformer genre with its minimalist yet deeply atmospheric approach. Developed by Playdead, the game immerses players in a haunting monochromatic world filled with mystery and danger.

The striking black-and-white visuals, combined with a chillingly minimalist sound design, create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that grips you from start to finish. The puzzles are clever, intuitive, and seamlessly tied to the environment, offering just the right balance of challenge and satisfaction.

What makes Limbo stand out is its ability to tell a profound, thought-provoking story without a single word of dialogue. Its themes of survival, loss, and exploration resonate deeply, making it more than just a game, it's an experience.

For fans of atmospheric and emotionally driven games, Limbo is an absolute must-play. Its influence on the indie game scene is undeniable, and its haunting world will stay with you long after you’ve reached the end.",True,14,0,2025-01-20 08:07:49
"Besides a couple of levels where the solution is more obscure than I'd like, this is a decent 2D puzzle game. The secret level/path is especially creative. The controls leave some things to be desired however. Unlike other people, I can't really say the game's atmosphere resonated with me.",True,1,0,2025-02-07 09:18:54
"This game has no settings related to graphics, and I'm unable to move the game to a different monitor - my primary monitor is not the monitor I game on. I cannot use win+shift+arrow keys to move it (it moves a black screen but not the game), I cannot move it with win+tab.

I don't want to change my primary monitor just for a game. At least give me a setting to make the game into a window and let me drag it and make it full screen.

The game developers have ignored the basics, ignoring that gamers may not have the exact same setup as them. Just let me move the game to a different monitor, don't expect players to change their primary monitor just for your game.",False,2,0,2025-01-19 20:09:30
"Limbo is a great game that challenges players with clever, physics-based puzzles. However, what truly sets it apart is its haunting atmosphere.

"This was a humbling experiencee... I enjoyed it, all I'll say is lot of the time the solution to puzzles were VERY unclear, I found the same problem with INSIDE too (although probably just a skill issue in my case).

"It's an old but gold game that's worth a shot.

Mechanically simple and easy to pick up. The puzzles are straightforward and feels rewarding.

For a 100% completion, I even discovered a section I never knew existed before; and I'm personally a big fan. Basically throwing everything you've learned throughout the game and putting it in one continuous challenge. It's hard but fair.

There is 1 achievement that's absolutely tedious though, it took me 3 hours... in one sitting.",True,0,0,2025-02-10 15:04:13

"I played this game because I enjoyed INSIDE so much.  LIMBO was interesting but it was also dark, creepy, and mysterious.  I do think INSIDE was certainly a huge upgrade from this game, but it was still enjoyable.  The puzzles at times were a bit hard to do though, as there were two or three puzzles in total that I had to lookup after a lot of thinking.  My favorite moment of the game was definitely when the girl was there at first in one of the final chapters, but then you have to walk away and when you come back its an entirely different setting.",True,0,0,2025-02-06 02:58:49

"I can honestly say I'm disappointed in myself for not finishing this sooner.

-2012, I finished building my first gaming pc and launched Steam. Found Limbo and played it.
Found plenty of other games and lost interest in Limbo. 

-2013, picked it back up and got through about 8 chapters, set it down and left it alone.

-2025, decided to play it on my Steam Deck and polish it off.

Frankly, very impressed. Ambiance is terrific, the spider is horrible, wish it was longer. Thank you.",True,0,0,2025-01-22 05:12:22
"I would strongly recommend thise game. It's not what I expected and in a very good way. The puzzles get more and more complex as you progress throught the chapters, you really have to think outside of the box sometimes.

"How good can a simple black & white game be anyway?  I asked myself that question before starting but wow, this one grabs you in and doesn't let go, with physical/mechanical based puzzles that grow increasingly complex.  This one and its sister game, ""Inside"" remain two of my top 10 favorites.",True,0,0,2025-01-19 20:29:13
"Although no words were said. This game is an emotional roller coaster. 
Truly an amazing experience and i'm very thankful I took the time to give it a serious try.
The game is extremely unforgiving but the sense of accomplishment you gain from completing what seemed like an impossible task there is no other feeling like it. 
I hope the developer and his/her team are living well and doing what they love!

"At first I thought the game was quite charming, I'm used to a bit of horror here and there from playing Little Nightmares and was expecting a similar experienced based on what I could see of the game. The beginning of the game definitely delivered on that but it was the last third of the game that lost me. I don't mind too much to die and figure out a puzzle, it'll give a nice aha moment when I finally figure it out but at a certain point it became more frustrating and less intuitive.

 The last third of the game was horrible in that it didn't really matter how many times you died, or how much time you spent on a puzzle because it was really poor at keeping consistency with newly introduced mechanics and it's sometimes unintuitive level design. I especially hated the gravity section as the switches used to hit it was so inconsistent in design each one looking completely different. There were about like 3 different designs, ones with arrows, one with no arrows and only a light that looks like other switches, and the arrow with a timer. It was frustrating trying to use the switches in that section not knowing if it would do one thing or the other, or even if it was a switch that could be turned off or a one time button. The arrows were also particularly annoying since it's easy to mistaken them as the direction to go instead of button to press when they break the previously introduced design.

It was just frustrating and time consuming, especially with the character controls functioning worse than a decent flash game. It was never really scary, or eerie or creepy, maybe shocking at times. While there may be parts I'd enjoy and found charming taking into account the overall experience; I would never recommend it to any one I know to play this game over other horror puzzle platformers. If you must, then buy it on sale. Otherwise when games go on sale just spend it on Little Nightmares, for a similar longer, more streamlined puzzle game, with actual tense moments and a well designed experience.",False,0,0,2025-02-10 09:26:38
"I liked the game design and the atmosphere. The puzzles are sometimes quite difficult, i had to look some of the solutions. I liked the first half of the game way more, it was more creepy and mysterious. In the second half the focous was more on the puzzles, which was alright, but it felt a bit like a different, more boring game.",True,0,0,2025-01-18 23:03:49

I just got to the end of this and it felt like a big deal! The puzzles can be really brutal and the game is super dark in theme. I think this is a top-tier game for people who like a great thinker and don't mind getting sawed in half a lot! The save points are generous so it's really not overly punishing. I generally did three our four segments during a given sitting and feel like that was a good pace.,True,0,0,2025-01-19 03:04:29
"For a murky, two-dimension journey Limbo explores distinct ideas which games haven't thought about blending together in the graceful way that this does. It challenges inner phobias by wrapping them up as a boss battle with an overgrown insect, emulating a sense of sheer vertigo at lofty heights and leaving the player unescorted through the abyssal absence of light. In terms of the visuals, those dark contrast effects ensure that all of the details are sensationally left up to imagination. The manner in which Limbo provokes the fear of the unknown keeps you interested in overcoming every level.",True,1,0,2025-02-11 02:48:27

"LIMBO – A Peaceful Stroll Through a Nightmare

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5 – Went in expecting a cute puzzle game. Left emotionally damaged.)

Ah, LIMBO. A charming little platformer where you play as a small boy searching for his sister. Sounds wholesome, right? WRONG. This game is actually a terrifying, shadowy world filled with giant spiders, deadly traps, and physics puzzles that made me question my IQ.

The art style? Beautiful. The atmosphere? Haunting. The number of times I died in the dumbest ways possible? Too many to count. One moment, you're hopping across some logs, enjoying the eerie silence, and the next, a massive spider leg impales you out of nowhere. Thanks for the heart attack, Playdead.

The puzzles are brilliant, but half the time, I solved them by accident—usually by dying 17 times first. And the sound design? Let’s just say every little creak and crunch had me paranoid that something horrifying was about to happen (spoiler: it usually was).

Overall, LIMBO is a masterpiece—dark, unsettling, and weirdly addictive. 10/10, would get crushed by a falling boulder again. 🕷️⚫💀
