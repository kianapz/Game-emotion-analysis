Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-12,"after getting all the achievements, this is my review. limbo is a platformer puzzle game with a special charm in the unique artstyle. none of puzzles are so hard that you would be stuck for more than 10 minutes, although it can get pretty difficult in the final stages. overall, this game is a must buy for me, but i would recommend to wait for it to go on discount, as the main story only takes around 5 hours. however, if your looking for the extra challenge, this game does offer that. you start by collecting 10 secret eggs around the levels, each with their own achievement. once you collect the eggs and beat the game once, you can do a bonus levels unavailable to you before that is very difficult. finally, the last achievement of the game requires you to beat the game in one sitting with less than 6 deaths. keep in mind the 2 completion rate, this is difficult. overall, this game is great for both the casual and competitive player and is a must by in my opinion."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-01,"love this game, i remember watching youtubers play this game in 2015 and its great to play it by myself. 1010"
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-26,"great game and story, for the price on discount totally worth it"
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-25,i love the creepy atmosphere even tho the game isn't that fancy and go with that simple bnw. very epic and you guys should play this game
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-21,"phenomenal game!! 1010. so immersive and atmospheric. the puzzles are really clever and a ton of fun. i had to stop a few times to just appreciate certain levels and the thought that went into the puzzle and the story. i found the difficulty level perfect. didn't get stumped until the later chapters so it's neat it got progressively more difficult. fun game to take screenshots of too. i had a great time with the hidden achievements. make sure that when you get to the last level, you're running the game with fullscreen mode and not windowed mode otherwise it will freeze. go into the game files and open the file settings in notepad and make windowedmode  false, like it defaults to. all the other levels are fine to play on windowed mode. just not the last scene of the final chapter."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-06,"great game, simple but fun puzzles. the story is not really told to you but you are able to understand it, 10 potatoes 10 potatoes, would recommend."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-27,"good game but not of my type. no spoilers  it is a hard to recommend game. unless you are nostalgic for this game, it might be a masterpiece for you . however , new players might find it a hard hook , like me . as the gameplay is mostly platform puzzles , it can get boring at times . story is pretty mysterious , the story is all based on theories which is not much explained in game and is mostly made up by fandom. if you are into platform puzzles , linear gameplay and non verbal story this game can be for you."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-13,"interesting and mysterious puzzle platformer. i really like the puzzles, some can be more complex and some easy. would recommend."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-12,"what is your criteria for calling a game a masterpiece? amazing graphics? great gameplay? deep and philosophical story? limbo is a video game masterpiece at its simplest. you won't hear a single line of dialogue in this game, but you will be immersed in the game's environment and atmosphere in a way that is unbelievable even to yourself. highly recommended. trust me, this game will change your perception of a masterpiece."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-08,"it's a great, simple, short game. the style is very unique. even though this game was made in 2011, to this day it is still a great game."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-05,"almost can't recomend this game, but at the end i think it was worth it. there's only a few moves you can make, so devs struggled to stretch the length of the game with increasingly frustrating puzzles. i you aren't used to puzzlers and platforming, you'll end up looking up guides to advance through a couple of really cryptic levels if you are a seasoned puzzler, you'll be like been there done that. the visual storytelling is great. i don't play a lot of games like this, so i personally found it refreshing and not quite overstaying it's welcome. good for 4 hours of gaming maybe even more someday."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-04,"the game's atmosphere is delightfully dark and horrorfilled the graphics, sounds, lighting, and blackandwhite aesthetic all contribute to creating an elegant, dreamlike setting while keeping the splatter aspect front and center. the puzzles are highly varied, sometimes complex, and make use of different physical properties of objects and the environment. at times, you might get stuck, feeling like there's no solution, only to come up with a new and unexpected idea perhaps the next day that allows you to overcome the obstacle. timing is sometimes crucial. engaging and fun."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-04,"the deaths can be pretty funny, the game is a little short but worth a play through if you enjoy interesting puzzles and just getting a good laugh at some weird stuff that happens."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-03,"man is this game still amazing all these years later the one title who came, went and resurrected the entire indie puzzleplatformer genre it's like a buck every now and then when it's on sale and can comfortably be finished in one afternoon recommend it with all my hearth btw if you want to play at a higher res you gotta edit that setting.txt file and change from 720 to 1080"
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-03,"i would say that limbo pales in comparison to its successor, inside, but there is a five year gap in development and it still has its own charm in a much more eerie and minimalist way. to be honest, my feelings playing limbo is what i expected by experience to be with inside. i compared inside to being like a bad dream, but in a good way. limbo feels like a bad dream, but in a bit of an annoying way the overly fluctuating brightness of the grainy background, the interactable objects being the same shade of black just like the ground, and very technical timing of many of the later puzzles leaving you to repeat them several times over though you've already figured out what you're supposed to do. storywise it really feels like there was nothing, but if you're just looking for a quick yet challenging platforming puzzle game, this is it."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-02,"limbo is a indie classic at this point. the monochrome graphics are effective and eerily beautiful, the sound is atmospheric, simple and highly effective. plus the control scheme is possibly more simplistic than super mario bros, limbo really proves that you don't need a huge budget to make an effective and memorable game. now fifteen years later i revisit it and find it still a satisfying trek. while the game is definitely on the short side it doesn't decide to fluff up the time by giving you repetitive puzzles, each new puzzle seems pretty different from the previous ones. on the downside it is very short and some of the puzzles do turn out being trial and error especially when trying to master the timing. it's totally worth it when it is on a steep discount. it's old and short, but it's still fun so it's a solid filler you can fit in between other games. snag it while it's on sale if you haven't before."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-01,"the design and mechanics are absolutely great , a good game no doubt use any tricks you have  i played this decade ago now im back again d"

Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-28,a very adventurous game but lacking in story and content.
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-26,"a perfect platformer, combining dark themes with puzzles."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-25,"simple in execution and gameplay, minimalist in style and storytelling, limbo is an early example of an indie darling that ends up being more than the sum of its parts. well worth its low cost and short time investment. easy to recommend."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-25,best 23 hours of my life! love the art style and the ambience is fantasticnot to mention the great puzzles too
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-21,"limbo is a dark, puzzle game in a dystopian world. you play as a small child navigating eerie environments filled with deadly traps. pros  clever puzzles  cute yet creepy  dystopian vibes  runs well on deck cons  frequent deaths  not for those who dont like seeing a child get dismembered  no background music  can feel boring when you're stuck  black  white art style  sometimes hard to see details final verdict creepy, clever, and fun, but expect to diea lot. if you like games that challenge you with clever mechanics and a haunting world, limbo is definitely worth a try!"
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-21,"this game is awesome  i love the art style, the game play is simple yet very challenging. i can't recommend this game enough."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-18,"this is a short and fun platform game that moves seamlessly through a haunting and eerie ambient environment. the minimal sounds and lighting, use of shadows, and curious landscape are great design choices. expect to use multiple senses and thoughtful timing to move through the puzzles. there's no given story line, which adds to the mysterious feel of the game. one play through is enough and worth the few hours of play."
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-02-17,i felt compelled to check out limbo after being enamored with cocoon  and im so happy to finally understand why its earned its status as the godfather of modern puzzle platformers. so good!

Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-01,"the overall game is nice but i don't think its worth its price, so unless the game is on a 7090 deal i wouldn't recommend the game"
Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-02,"there's no limbo bar in the game, just so you know other than that, great game. must buy especially when it's on huge sale"

Puzzle,Limbo,2025-03-10,"limbo is a game, based on traditions that originated on the island of tobago. the aim is to pass forwards under a low bar without falling or dislodging the bar. the dance originated as an event that took place at wakes in tobago. it was popularized in the 1950s by dance pioneer julia edwards1 known as the first lady of limbo and her company which appeared in several films, in particular fire down below 1957, and toured widely in the caribbean, europe, north america, south america, asia, and africa in the 1960s and later. a horizontal bar, known as the limbo bar, is supported by two vertical bars. all contestants must attempt to go under the bar with their backs facing toward the floor. when passing under the bar, players must bend backwards. no part of their body is allowed to touch the bar, and no part other than their feet may touch the ground. they must not turn their head or neck to the side. whoever knocks the bar off or falls is eliminated. after everyone has passed under the bar in this manner, the bar is lowered slightly and the contest continues. the contest ends when only one person can pass under the bar."
