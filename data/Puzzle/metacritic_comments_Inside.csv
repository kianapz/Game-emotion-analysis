Puzzle,Inside,2024-09-30,"game should never strives to be movie. ever. the obsecurity has to come with engaging gameplay. inside, on the other hand, has a trial and error bloated repetitiveness that refrains players from any genuine preparation or challenging problem solving. also, there is a fake sense of intensity with each tomjerry chase this games forces you to. though there are strong moments, it does not help the game to escape mediocrity."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-07-27,keeps the same intriguing puzzles and creepy vibe of limbo while vastly improving the storytelling. the ending will drop your jaw to the floor.

Puzzle,Inside,2024-03-23,"at first, i thought it was a game to manipulate jewish boys to escape from  human laboratory."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-02-08,"i really enjoyed this title a lot. i started it without knowing what to expect, but i was immediately impressed by the graphics and gameplay. it's definitely not a game i would play again, but an a run is a must. very nice."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-01-27,"a real escape from reality into the haunting, daunting world of inside. i was stunned."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-01-20,fun game that was a bit too short. i felt the puzzles were too easy but the story and atmosphere were top notch and the game had a creepy vibe.
Puzzle,Inside,2024-01-18,"a true masterpiece, a model for every independent game. wildly imaginative plot, beautifully designed puzzle"
Puzzle,Inside,2021-05-30,it isn't a bad game it's just the fact that i didn't like it. when i played i felt bored and i just waited for it to end.
Puzzle,Inside,2023-12-18,"i enjoyed this game, but i don't see it as the masterpiece many others say it is. the puzzles are fun, the world is interesting and some of the more unnerving moments really land, but i can't see past much of what it just presents. nonetheless, i'd definitely recommend this puzzle or horror enthusiasts!"
Puzzle,Inside,2023-12-04,"i liked limbo more, but this is still a very good game. if only it was just like limbo a bit longer. 34 hours is just too short for my taste."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-10-31,"inside keeps you interested at all time. the ambience and art style are top notch, unfortunately, the game's story is so open it doesn't even give a general direction, and it leaves the player with absolutely no idea about what happened. i feel like some more story hints would have made this an amazing game, and while it's still good, it would be delusional to give it a 9 or a 10."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-10-24,the greatest 3 hours
Puzzle,Inside,2023-10-21,in the game i am literally manipulator puppeteer manipulation interests
Puzzle,Inside,2023-09-07,"inside looks like a really simple game but it's really deep and entertaining. loved challenging puzzles and idea behind the game. to me this game represents the rat race people are in nowadays. time by time society acts like programmed machines, doing same things day by day and slowly all the emotions and happiness we felt back in the days fade away. fortunately there are still people left who try to stay away from society's standards and they prefer to live their life in their own way. that's exactly what i saw in inside and it does a great job in showing you all that."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-08-27,inside is a masterpiece with a claustrophobic atmosphere and clever puzzle design.

Puzzle,Inside,2023-06-26,"i liked this game and i advise you to try it, there is nothing more to add!"
Puzzle,Inside,2023-06-12,"inside the brains puzzle before we start inside is a puzzleplatform video game developed by playdead and published on june 29, 2016. the game was completed 100 on xbox series x. breaking in inside is an extremely linear title based on silent storytelling through the game's continuous animated backgrounds. the early gameplay stages do not differ much from what the player will encounter throughout the entirety of the story, allowing them to face any adversity from the beginning. most of the mechanics are highly intuitive, thanks to the simplicity of the usable buttons, the jump and the grab. the dark and macabre setting of the story is easily discernible from the initial deaths, which are quite easy to come across due to the nontrivial difficulty of this title. out of body experience as mentioned earlier, with limited interaction buttons, inside focuses on the complexity of its puzzles, which are almost always distinct from one another but interconnected enough to prevent the player from feeling disoriented. some sections of the game are quite challenging to overcome without experiencing fatalities, but as it relies partially on trial and error, they never become frustrating or predictable, aided by a multitude of death animations. as the title suggests, the mechanic on which many puzzles revolve is the ability to control other humanoids by entering their bodies, utilized for both platforming sections and structured puzzles. in addition to the extremely linear story, there are several collectibles that lead to highly crafted secondary areas. fading to black graphically, inside blends a minimalistic style, employing flat colors and graphics, with a 3d approach characterized by a pronounced depth of field and rich details. the story is entirely conveyed through events in the background or foreground, with people interacting with the game environment or the player themselves, often pursuing them to capture. the background, therefore, is not merely a passive element to observe but always interactive with the current gameplay situation the player is trying to complete. that bark the audio component is relatively straightforward, with background soundtracks suitable for each passage. but why 8? pros the extreme simplicity of inside is one of its defining characteristics, making it a relaxing and fastpaced game to play. furthermore, the puzzles are never predictable or boring, nor too difficult or frustrating. additionally, the story is as simple as it is effective. cons the lack of a noteworthy soundtrack is a significant drawback for such an authorial game, making certain areas feel rather bare and playable without audio with few issues and shortcomings. additionally, at times, the game feels too linear, with levels that give a sense of dj vu. ratings gameplay 8.5 music 7 story 7 puzzles 8.5"
Puzzle,Inside,2023-04-23,"like limbo this is a true masterpiece from the same devs. i am always amazed as this is not the kind of game i play but it is really good. worth the full price and especially if on sale. it is a puzzle spooky game with a some background story to it, that is up to you to understand. the game inspiration was what drew me to it.  representing a boy escaping a concentration camp in ww2 germany was the inspiration for this game  i learned it after starting it, once i knew i really wanted to continue and finish it i have not been able to finish it since i am stuck atm but really, try it out."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-04-15,one of the best indie games ever  artstyle it's incredible and everything is just so perfectly mixed. an absolute gem to play and replay
Puzzle,Inside,2023-03-18,a really atmospheric game which has a decent amount of puzzles that sometimes require a lot of trial and error to finish. the story can be interpreted in different ways i literally have zero idea wtf happens by the end. it does get a bit when you mostly move to the right side the entire time but some of run for your life moments were genuine nice. get it at full price!
Puzzle,Inside,2023-03-18,"i honestly found this one to be much overrated as an experience. it's not bad, it's certainly not outstanding either."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-03-05,"inside is a masterpiece of game design that will leave you breathless and speechless. the game is a stunning visual and auditory experience that immerses you in a dark and dystopian world where you control a young boy who must escape from a mysterious facility. the game is full of clever puzzles, tense moments, and shocking twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. the game has no dialogue or text, but it tells a powerful and emotional story through its brilliant animation and sound design. the game is also incredibly polished and smooth, with no bugs or glitches to ruin the immersion. inside is a game that you have to play to believe. it is one of the best games i have ever played and a true work of art."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-02-17,great game
Puzzle,Inside,2023-01-30,this game is very tense and mysterious. the graphics are nice. a different experience with short gameplay.
Puzzle,Inside,2023-01-10,"amazing. the art style, the scary envoirment.. i was really not expectong to have so much fun. piece of art"
Puzzle,Inside,2023-01-09,"one of the greatest games ever made. it's more like a dense, thick and overwhelming movie than just a game. and that ending!"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-15,"inside took 4 hours for me. the game keeps you excited for all time. i liked the puzzles, most are very obvious and dont push you out from the flow. good luck thinking about the ending! i recommend for everyone."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-11,"i think i saw the end with the maximum immersion from the beginning to the end the play time is extremely short, but it seems to be a masterpiece among the lesserknown games"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-11-23,"and one of the coolest simple games i've ever played on a computer, this game's animations and physics are reminiscent of limbo"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-11-10,short but efficient. that gloomy and eerie atmosphere is what makes this game so special and beautiful in a weird way. a kinda unsatisfying ending tho. but the whole experience was so captivating that you kinda forgive them.
Puzzle,Inside,2022-11-01,it has very dark atmosphere but when you do the puzzle or pass something you can feel the sense of achievement and it is a short game
Puzzle,Inside,2022-10-18,brilliant game with very strong atmosphere and setting. a very big step from the previous limbo game.
Puzzle,Inside,2022-09-18,"if you happened to come across the developers' previous title  limbo  then this title is pretty much move of the same experience, perhaps with a very revamped graphics. i even went back to look at my limbo review and honestly think that most stuff i wrote there apply to inside as well pros overall, a great physicsbased puzzle game puzzles are just enough challenging to feel satisfying and not insanely hard or easy generous save points great for quick sessions only if it's your cup of tea  short and linear  like many other game of the genre, it does not get away from plenty but not only timebased or reflexbased puzzles  very simplistic mechanics  controls  no actual story? now, in comparison with limbo, inside takes the eerie and frightful ambience of limbo and takes all the notches one level up. the 3d graphics look fantastic. the quality of the puzzles is about the same, with some being rather easy, some being very challenging and make you scratch your head for some time, and some just based on reflexes, but the overall experience is fun and challenging just enough without making you want to give up already. the no actual story point may be a bit wrong for both limbo and inside, as both titles do have some sort of a story, but it seems that most of it is intentionally left for the players to theorize. in inside, there are some more clues to an actual explainable story, you can make some sense of some of the events but all in all it's all still intentionally very ambiguous and not straightforward, which is fine for whoever that's their cup of tea. the only thing that was bad for me was perhaps that i've played this straight after playing limbo. the two games are very similar gameplaywise, and going to this right after finishing limbo had also had a bit of a ugh... there it goes all over again as the two games are very different on the surface but have a very similar core experience, i believe. so, all in all, inside is a truly great game for lovers of physics based puzzled tied with creepy atmosphere, and those who do not care about short, linear, and not very selfexplaining experiences. if someone ever thinks about playing limbo  inside one after another, then perhaps it may be best to take a break first, and only go back to the other title after some time, to be able to fully appreciate both games without the maybe unjustified feeling that they outstayed their welcome."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-09-13,"just completed the game, got it on the steam sale and it didn't click for me. general thoughts the game is very short mysterious and forgettable. very hollowempty story with unique graphics, if you get it for 2 dollars like me its very much worth it, full price highly not recommended"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-07-29,"i haven't played this game, only in 2022 because it was available on xbox game pass. what a little gem, i had a great time with it, smart puzzle although not hard, last part of the game was crazily funny. overall, great 45 hours of gameplay, time was well spent."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-07-23,"inside's minimalist art style, atmosphere and story that is told without words is mesmerizing."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-06-27,my best game i've played. artistic and dramatic. great atmosphere. and i think the very small gb 1.5 buy now and play.
Puzzle,Inside,2022-05-26,is a great game with good sound band and amazing art design but sometimes is so dark in some ambients but it's a game i recommend play.
Puzzle,Inside,2022-05-06,this game was a deeply moving experience for me. this whole game is a very good symbol of how the adult life surrounds and limits children in a way that makes children be a bad version of their potential selves.
Puzzle,Inside,2022-03-26,"very pretty, lovely narrative, lovely puzzles, certainly a wonderful, though short, platforming puzzle experience. only wish it went on longer."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-03-22,"inside is a puzzleplatformer adventure game developed and published by playdead. inside is a puzzle platformer. the player character is an unnamed boy who explores a surreal and mostly monochromatic environment presented as a 2.5d platform game. the game is dark, with color used sparingly to highlight both the player and certain parts of the environment. the game is also mostly silent, with the exception of occasional musical cues, the boy's vocals, dogs barking, equipment and sound effects. the player controls the boy who walks, runs, swims, climbs, and uses objects to overcome obstacles and progress in the game. the boy gains the ability to control bodies to complete certain puzzles. at various points in the game, the player may discover hidden rooms containing glowing orbs. if all the orbs are deactivated during a playthrough, the player unlocks the game's alternate ending."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-02-27,masterpiece great game good gameplay good graphics interesting story i want see more inside games .
Puzzle,Inside,2022-02-27,masterpiece great game good gameplay good graphics interesting story i want see more inside games .
Puzzle,Inside,2022-01-25,"one of the most atmospheric games ever done. set in a twisted dystopian world, great puzzles, perfect platformer."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-01-05,"in just a few hours of playing, you will plunge into the thick gloomy atmosphere of an incomprehensible dystopia. a boy who came from nowhere, but it is clear that he stands out and contradicts the current world order and state of affairs. this is a miniplatformer in which you have to run and escape from hypnosisslavery... but where to run? ...to do what? great atmosphere, simple and easy controls, not particularly difficult secrets, each has a small story if you look closely at the details. and one big secret, at the end and not so much at the end  ...as in limbo  this story does not have an unambiguous and complete ending. but the ending of both of them cannot be called cutted. everything is done well and efficiently. so this game... this dark picture... is great. therefore, i highly recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-12-28,"best game i have played so far. a possibly deep storyline, great mechanics. only gripe is that there are one or two areas which are really really tricky, and developers should make sure that a once those bits are bypassed, it doesn't return to them if killed shortly afterwards b and that all bits are actually feasibly playable by people with 99 ability and slightly less than optimal equipment. it should not be the case that the user should be expected to do the same stunt 500 times."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-12-08,"a fantastic looking game. the game atmosphere is great! 23 hours you will be accompanied by small puzzles and a very open story. i recommend everyone who needs a little game on the side to escape mainstream games like assassin's creed or battlefield. the story leaves a lot of space for your own ideas and  combination with the music, the graphics create a really good game atmosphere. the puzzles are not easy but definitely solvable. i like thie game 3"
Puzzle,Inside,2021-11-03,"it's an awesome game. pros.  looks like limbo, though, it's not limbo. and that was a great game. here the gameplay is similar, yet, different.  style. cool to see the simple choice to emphasize the main character with light red. so, if you see any game design elements in red you understand where you should go and what you should do.  story. there is almost no story and explanation what is happening in the game. why the boy is chased, why is he going right, what is going on with the sound waves, wires, dome, etc. but it is left to the player. you interpret it the way you want. the developers give you a hint with several gameplay elements and devices. but you may find any kinds of explanations you want.  music. cool ambient sounds and music. cons.  i guess, there could be more hints about the world. or the yellow cables. but now the game seems perfect. it's one of those cases when the game is great and balanced gameplay, puzzle difficulty, length, performance, music, etc. recommend to everyone. and it's not a limbo clone."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-09-27,"the puzzles were boring. they're easy to figure out once you figure out what all of the elements are, but you spend most of your time slowly walking around large areas figuring out if there's something you're supposed to find. this is especially painful when you're underwater. the aesthetics are well done, but it's kind of like the tv show lost. they throw a lot of intriguing elements at you and you can do some work to try to connect them or imagine why they're there, but i'm not going to do that. it's all arbitrary nonsense. the world is grim, but stupid. spoilers everyone is united in their desire to murder children as soon as they see one wearing a red shirt. but then when you become a flesh monster destroying their facilities, they don't use their guns."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-07-19,"story, sound design, world design, puzzle difficulty everything is perfect. overall, the best platformer game i have ever played, period."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-07-01,"summary what will you find? the good  amazing visuals and atmosphere.  lots of visual variety.  intuitive, clever puzzles. the bad  some sections drag the pace down.  overpriced relative to its length.  intriguing narrative."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-06-16,"an excellent platformer puzzle game that keeps you on your toes throughout the game. separate homage to narrative storytelling, which does not give us a complete picture, but it gives you the opportunity to think out the story around you yourself. the perfect balance between action scenes and puzzles does a great job. in the 6 hours that it took me, i never got bored for a second. well, the secret ending once again makes you think what the hell is going on here."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-05-27,"like limbo, it is a tragic game filled with intricate puzzles requiring focus and trial by death to unravel. it masterfully depicts loneliness with its eerie, echoing soundtrack, noir effects and depressed atmosphere. its 2.5d gameplay always keeps you on edge of what's to come... with great physics and unique gameplay, you can be in awe as you progress through the game. i honestly played that game about 3 times and still didn't know what the hell happened the boy with no relation or ally, is attracted to the huddle, making him risk his life through dangerous levels and oppressive agents from inside, to free it, and in the end helping it go outside. the game inside, in essence ends outside. this is a masterfully done game, among one of the very best games ever made. it is symbolic of individuality and ideaological freedom. a concept that must not be lost on anyone, if not already... my personal 5 game. 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-05-26,"i played limbo right before this one and did not enjoy it much. inside is quite a bit better though. this time around, the puzzles made more sense and the story was actually in the game and not just in its description. the move from 2d into 3d without abandoning the side scroller movement worked very well, and the controls were a lot more polished in comparison to the predecessor. i overall enjoyed it, but some puzzles felt unnecessarily frustrating and the timing was often way too narrow. otherwise i definitely recommend it over limbo although i'd never pay the full 16.49  on gog."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-05-26,"i'm amazed. this game is perfect. a true masterpiece. well balanced, a whole lot of details. just perfect."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-05-06,"atmospheric, beautiful, terrifying, immersing and nervous adventure. smart puzzles, outstanding graphics and fluid animations. must play for the ones who likes different types of experiences. this game will make you surprised so many times by the end of it."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-04-26,"inside provides a great experience of a dystopian, totalitarian state we try to run away from as a child. atmosphere, dark environment, light, disturbing music and great sound design makes it a memorable journey. one may consider inside an interactive work of art rather than a form of entertainment. brutal, unforgiving nature of the human world has been captured on so many levels mind control slavery, police state, unethical experiments and making a show out of that.... puzzles are pretty simple, gameplay isn't the most sophisticated overall, but it let's us to experience the vision without frustrating drawbacks or searching google for a walkthrough to solve certain problems. we are fully allowed to immerse and sink into this world instead."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-04-19,the only bad thing about this game is its length. but it's literal perfection
Puzzle,Inside,2021-03-07,"i think the game is worth playing, the atmosphere is very good and if you like this kind of games, you should give it a chance."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-03-06,"wow, this game is literally stunning. they don't use a single word but they managed to tell a good story. the game lasts approximately 2 hours. the secret ending is ingenious. this is a masterpiece, a puzzle game like few others."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-02-20,"even if, i have abided this genre of game that is 2d i really love so much because just your character 2d, other thing like shapes, npcs was designed by 3d. maybe it stemmed from my consciousness. i finished that game in 6 hours. i can tell you this has been prolonged game than same types of others. some puzzles was hardcore for me. if you like to play that, don't think about it, just have a look inside its atmosphere."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-02-13,a surprisingly wonderful and creative side scroller. the atmosphere and graphics are superb as well.
Puzzle,Inside,2021-02-05,"inside  9.5  10  i really recommend it the game is tense, atmospheric, surrounding, unique  pros  unique and tense atmosphere at all times  progression with variety of different and unique regions  mysterious but very well elaborated story, which instigates the player's curiosity  challenging and wellbuilt puzzles  cons  many facts related to the story are left open, and you have to find out for yourself out of the game, while some have no explanation  by breaking expectations, the game confuses the player when finished, and even gives a feeling of incompleteness  verdict the verdict is that inside is a masterpiece without a doubt, for its deep and reflective history, and for being the most atmospheric game you're going to play, being very engaging and not being too long. the progression of the chapters is perfect, the world is unique, and it gives you the feeling of depth even though it's a platform, an extremely rare thing to achieve in games like this, a key piece that makes it so remarkable and exceptional. despite the plot's open questions, you don't need to understand it completely to know that this game is amazing and unique in everything it does, and that definitely worth helping that boy fleeing this polluted, dark, and agonizing industry."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-01-16,"just like limbo, inside has a very atmospheric tone that i really enjoyed. the story was gripping and leaves room for imagination and different interpretations."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-01-15,"inside is surprising. a 100 improvement in limbo, with good puzzles and the same proposal to throw you there without telling you anything, which makes you research, create, watch theories. one of the best indie games after 2008."
Puzzle,Inside,2021-01-01,"inside has been the best game i've played inside the pandemic quarantine. the graphics were amazing, the sound effects were lifelike and the plot was brilliant. the plot is a bit hard to understand and they've done the same in the must watch movie, the matrix. this is what makes the game must play. ignore the negative reviews since this is all about understanding, you'll understand more when you play the second time. i'm not going to give a spoiler but, this game has a secret ending that is giving answers to our questions, please give it a try."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-28,a very dark and dense experience. i love it. i has many shapes of complexity and explores some interesting themes.
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-27,"wow... just wow. i got this game for free on epic games, and god damn what a worthy download this was, this game has no dialogue, no prerendered cutscenes, it's simply gameplay. everything it does, it does perfectly, the story is up to the player to interpret. the game never holds your hands, everything you have to figure out and solve on your own yes, including the story and i love that. the platforming is quite easy but the puzzles get really challenging at times. let's talk about the art style, the game's best aspect, it just looks so  good, the lighting is impressive and the dark colors give a depressing atmosphere. plus, the animations and the physics are on point. i was really expecting this game to be super easy, but the dogs and the mermaid really  me up, i died countless times embarrassingly. the audio design and the music are phenomenal and truly bring out the atmosphere of this dystopian world. once you start up the game, you won't leave it till you beat it, which should take you a maximum of 6 hours if you take your time and try to get all the secrets and after finishing i wasn't done and immediately went to read theories and watch videos about it and check if anyone else had the same theory as me. this is a short experience i'll never forget in my life. well done to the indie developers."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-24,it was a short game but i really liked it the riddles were good you do not get bored even for a single moment my friend suggested the game and now i suggest it to you
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-17,"a great platform game, and a mustplay for lovers of tense, atmospheric platform games."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-17,an excellent atmospheric platformer with easy puzzles. nice plot and setting.
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-15,"this is definitely my type of game. very cool mechanics, beautiful although limited graphics and very involving gameplay. the story is also oneofakind. big recommendation!"
Puzzle,Inside,2020-12-02,"yes, limbo was good but this is something else. i'm in love with the design of the game. so smart and beautiful. must play."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-11-19,"this is one of the most beautiful games i have ever played. not very long, it's true, but the experience is indeed very satisfying. i loved the story or what i could make of it, all the ambience, the puzzles and the general gameplay. i am now looking for more games from this editor. this game should be played!"
Puzzle,Inside,2020-10-31,"honestly, i didn't expect that inside could be as good as limbo. but i was wrong! this game is far far better than limbo. graphics, mechanism, great environment design and darkness of game...there's no word to describe it. it's really great that developers could keep puzzles challenging and hard in comparison with limbo. the change from 2d limbo to 2.5d inside was a big risk for playdead. but i'd call it a successful move. one of the most important reasons i love playdead's games is that while you play the game, you have no idea what you are doing. game doesn't reveal the story until the very end. ending, is where you begin to understand game's purpose in your own way. you're the one who decides what the story is. that's why there are so many websites that write theories about game's story. october 2020"
Puzzle,Inside,2020-10-19,"its a pretty good short game, the puzzles are great and the melancholic atmosphere really hits. but in my opinion, its kinda overrated. is it a great game? yes. is it a masterpiece? ...nah. i would still recommend this game, i hope you can get more of it than i did, but perhaps i was expecting too much, who knows."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-09-11,"only buy this game if it is on a major discount. i beat the game in about 3 hours, so it is extremely short. if i tried to play through again, i could probably finish it in 2 hours, maybe 90 minutes with the secret ending which is faster than the regular ending. the game is atmospherically very interesting to look at. however the character model of the character and other npcs is very basic, so they look out of place compared to the background. a very enjoyable puzzle platformer, but it never gets very complex, which i liked personally. it was just continuous movement and only one time i got stuck trying to figure something out, and only one puzzle was particularly complex and i realized that it was a drag because it took forever to continue moving forward. overall you don't get much of a story. the game seems to promise some sort of closure as you near the end, but ultimately there is nothing to be learned. everything about this made me feel like i get more story and plot from a 2d mario game. don't expect to feel closure and satisfaction. expect to be frustrated and dissapointed and feel like everything you did was pointless. in the end, it was good enough, i want more games that play like this, but this one in particular failed to deliver on story, and was too expensive, i bought it at 7 so i feel like i paid the right price, but at 20, don't bother. you would be overpaying by far."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-08-24,"loved this game! found it a bit disturbing, punishing, and claustrophobic, but maybe that's why it felt so satisfying to succeed. amazing style and design."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-08-22,"if you have a few spare hours to spend on a game and are not motivated enough to learn lots of new controlsmechanisms, but also want a fun experience with interesting puzzles and a dark themed story, this is the game for you! its very similar to limbo which i liked a lot. but also it's more detailed when it comes to graphics and effects. controls are exactly the same. the puzzles are very easy at the beginning and get harder and harder over time, but they are all manageable. in general i would say they are a bit easier than the ones in limbo which doesn't mean the game is super easy. at certain parts i was stuck for more than 30 mins, but it was always worth the effort. over all a very fun game, which i can recommend  especially when it's for sale. keep in mind it's very short! 810"

Puzzle,Inside,2020-07-24,magnificently mysteriosly awesome. theres no need for dialogue to tell what is going on because the visual is more than enough to drive the storyline. i will definetly wait for another game from this developer.
Puzzle,Inside,2020-07-09,"it was okay. didn't blow me away. playing as a giant meatball was fun, the scenery was bizarre, creepy and beautiful. i think i liked limbo more."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-06-30,"a spiritual sequel to limbo, with many elements retained such as the minichapter based gameplay, eerie atmosphere, faceless boy as the main character, but also some significant changes, most importantly the 2.5d graphics, and hence a completely new artistic style. the design of the world was beautiful, and some locations were so breathtaking and mesmerising, through a combination of visuals and sound, that i sat back speechless for a while! unfortunately, this happened very occasionally, just like properly engaging puzzles. what seemed like a significant majority of the game involved only walking to the right through pleasant, but not special, sceneries, which was at times really boring. the secret areas were way too easy too, especially with the hints in the achievement icons and descriptions 15.9 of players on steam got all secret areas, compared to 3.5 in limbo. i'm both impressed with how well the danish makers of this game were able to create a unique, eerie gameplay, and disappointed with how unexploited the potential was. it could easily be a 10hour, heartgripping adventure, but turned out to be a 4hour, rather monotonous semiplatformer. i wonder if maybe epic lost patience after several years and cut off funding or something like that"
Puzzle,Inside,2020-06-15,to say that my jaw dropped is a big understatement. it literally  imploded. a freaking masterpiece and truly deserving of the modern classic status it is undeniably going to achieve.
Puzzle,Inside,2020-06-06,so creepy! and very nice atmosphere. must play! .
Puzzle,Inside,2020-05-14,"while i couldn't get into limbo, this one refines the experience to the point where it is actually playable. not necessarily enjoyable, but that is in keeping with the theme. imaginative and captivating for what it is."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-05-12,"in my opinion, much better than limbo or little nightmares. of course, it doesnt have a plot because.... i dont know, it must be so hard to make it for this kind of games i guess?. good ambientation, nice level design and visuals. a little bit too short but still, recommended."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-05-05,"wtf? but a good wtf! yeah this game is nuts but a surprising very good nuts. the animation is just what was needed, the puzzles are good and the controls are really responsive, the puzzles feel more thoughtful and the creativity on the environment is amazing. but since this game come from the creators of limbo, is not all about the puzzles and gameplay, but what do they all mean, and i can't say that i figured it out when i played but when i went to forums everything just clicked and made this a little bit less crazy but at the same time, absurdly creative!"
Puzzle,Inside,2020-04-20,"inside it seems is cursed with the cursed all sequels have. everything seems to be there, but something just doesn't sit right. while limbo was atmospheric and engaging as if it were a living breathing world, inside's atmosphere is lacking and you can nearly just run through it's 'puzzles' without much thought. inside is too fast and what is there doesn't give you enough information bout what this world is all about. it is surprising when limbo's graphics were basically simple as could be yet somehow tell you so much more. another thing that disappointed me about inside is it's quite empty and not full of any surprises. while i have played through limbo multiple times i still can't remember the steps to complete some sections, yet playing inside again even once feels like you're just watching the events unfold rather than actually playing any part in them. when limbo does a bit of backtracking and gives you some breathing space inside is always, always pushing toward the finale, and toward a finale that seems so random, so pointless giving you no closure whatsoever on what is going on this world they had built up. if inside only slowed down a little and gave you some reason to slow down, it might actually be able to exhibit some semblance of a narrative and more importantly an interactive game. while i want to give inside a higher score, based on how much i liked and still enjoy limbo, i just can't justify it. when playdead's next instalment comes around it can only be expected that it will be more like inside and less like limbo."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-04-04,"i loved the story and the game atmosphere wow, the graphic style is amazing!!. i really enjoyed to play this game"
Puzzle,Inside,2020-04-03,"a step up from limbo in pretty much every way. a similar formula, but so incredibly refined. playdead knows exactly what they want to make and they know how to make it. the setting, story, and puzzles all fit together so well to put you into this world and the shoes of your poor little character. there is an incredibly deep lore to this universe that i have only barely scratched the surface of, yet i didn't feel left out at all. no spoilers here, but the final sequence is just such an unexpected dessert of chaos and catharsis, i implore you to see this adventure through to the end."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-03-24,"inside is a small puzzle game that has you on the run for your life. the game is fine, but it feels very linear and simple. the game is quite short, too, and is way too expensive for the content it offers."

Puzzle,Inside,2020-01-11,"i'm going to agree to disagree with the public. unlike the majority, respectfully, i didn't find this game as immersive and compelling as its predecessor, limbo. and it's not because of the easy puzzles or the lack of background music yes, those are obvious problems, but because of the lack of story. inside is one of those atmospheric games where the environment tries to tell you the entire story. unfortunately, even though i figured out what was going on not long into the game, the lengthy travelling was somewhat boring and eventually bothered me enough to want to just get the game done and over with. it felt like the game dragged on and kept throwing room after room at me just to keep me playing. in detail, the puzzles are easy and predictable and are nowhere near as hard as some of the ones in limbo, and this weighs on your enjoyment as they feel more like a chore. starting from the very first switchbased puzzle, i knew on the inside that the first switch would never be the right one. and i was right. this pattern stays true throughout the entire game, and makes the puzzles easier than they should be. as you progress through the game, the deeper you get, the more bizarre and grotesque the game becomes. i won't say that you will feel disgusted, but you will definitely feel disturbed by some of the things you see, which happen randomly without warning. this alone warrants tagging the game as horror, even if it's borderline. also, regarding the ending, there actually isn't one. that's right. it just ends. this is sure to anger a lot of players. overall, i'm mixed on inside, and leaning more to the negative side. i certainly wouldn't play it again, and i don't think i could recommend it to others, since it falls under a specific niche. if you have a few hours to burn and enjoy atmospheric indie games, you could give this one a shot. for me though, i think i could've spent the time playing some other game instead."
Puzzle,Inside,2020-01-10,this game is easy. if you look a puzzle game with easy playable this game is very strong alternative. atmosphere is very good. experience is very good.
Puzzle,Inside,2019-12-29,"visual and atmosphere is very good, but this game fails to deliver. the story is no existent. limbo had no story either but you could infer some clues from the name and the ending. this is totally an empty shell. unfortunately the worst part of the game is not the story but disappointing enough the riddles. unlike limbo where the actions had a sense and a logical structure i,e. move this in order to achieve that and then do something else to make the thing work this game has no logic.. you just move things around without knowing why pressing buttons without really a reason.. climb press the button then press another button climb again and... that is all. this is more a walking simulation with annoying riddles to fill up some time. visuals 8 atmosphere 10 story  2 gameplay 0"

Puzzle,Inside,2019-09-02,interesting gameplay and good graphics and fun but relatively simple puzzles. however it misses a trick as the story could have been developed so much more.

Puzzle,Inside,2019-06-25,"this game is super unique, and really amazing. the aesthetic is pretty basic but it gives a super ominous vibe which fits the game incredibly. the gameplay is pretty basic as well, you pretty much just walk around and grab stuff to interact with the environment. the thing that makes this game amazing is the setting, it's so unique and intriguing i really can't think of anything like it. the plot seems extremely weird and almost nonexistent at first. they don't really tell you anything so you have to piece it together, and when you do it's pretty awesome."
Puzzle,Inside,2019-06-02,"playdead studios were able to be minimalist and designed. the second game, and again a masterpiece like limbo. atmosphere, exciting and fascinating. the secret ending in my vision proves the theory of computer simulation. total 10 faceless boys of 10"
Puzzle,Inside,2019-03-13,"it's a great game, it summarizes the modern human tragedy without a single world, but with strong symbolism. it creates a perfect fearful atmosphere by masterful camera angles, using extreme loneliness, wastelands and huge deep waters and lots of echoes. i wish a similar game were made for a lovecraftian theme."
Puzzle,Inside,2019-02-02,"great atmosphere and overall art style, very impressive animations, perfectly enjoyable and at times reasonably challenging platforming gameplay that a times relies on trial and error, but dying in inside is part of the experience and one of the rare games where its fun. puzzles while not with much depth, still feel solid nevertheless. story demands fair amount of interpretation but i dont mind it. its just the ending that for me personally felt somewhat abrupt and unsubstantial. i know there's an alternate ending, as i found out after beating the game and reading about it, but the way youre suppose to get it doesnt feel sensible in the perspective of the game's narrative progression. still, inside's a properly good 2.5d platformer and it also runs well on pc, thank goodness, knowing how problematic unity engine can be."

Puzzle,Inside,2018-12-09,"it is a beautiful game with a very pretentious attitude. the gameplay is a bit of boring and repetitive, but luckily the game is not too long. the puzzles are way too easy for a game which solving puzzles are the sole gameplay element. and the ideas expressed through the narratives are too shallow compares to what it was trying to portrait. overall, it is a mediocre game which i'm glad is not too long. however, depending on how much you pay for this game, the short playtime may become an issue for some players."

Puzzle,Inside,2018-10-03,"this is the best game of its genre, hands down. it doesn't technically deserve a 10, but since it's at least a 9 and the best of its genre, in a genre that is lately overdone, it must have a bonus. definitely recommended to anyone liking some atmospheric platformer."

Puzzle,Inside,2018-05-28,"inside has great atmosphere and visuals. it also feels like one 3 hours long cutscene, where you have to keep one button pressed to progress, but somehow it is exciting."
Puzzle,Inside,2018-04-30,"this game is underrated in terms of it's depth as both a standalone game as well as the spiritual successor to limbo. my only negative criticism is that there could've been greater difficulty within the main quest puzzles, but even then it's hard to penalize this beaut ."
Puzzle,Inside,2018-04-14,"completion finished the game. pros  incredible minimalist visual style that manages to impress despite not being the most technically impressive piece of work. this helps to contribute to the eerie atmosphere of the game that only grows stronger as the story continues.  playdead does a great job of creating tension with its challenges, especially in the momenttomoment gameplay  intuitive puzzles that work based on logic rather than arbitrary rules . while this isn't necessarily a good or bad thing, this style works very well for inside and undoubtedly sets it apart from others in the genre.  ending sequence is shocking and unique in the best kind of way  although the game probably could've been just a little bit shorter, the length is more or less commensurate to the amount of unique content cons  trial and error puzzle design that often feels cheap. i am primarily referring to the sections of the game that will kill you without warning and are nearimpossible to predict based on contextclues and the parts of the game you have already experienced.  puzzles are too simple  especially when compared to limbo. strange to see that playdead has decided to take a step back in this department.  the story really is not good. it is exciting to actually play through, which is of course a good point. however, after finishing the game and looking back on what happened, there really is not that much substance. the themes are trite and the actual plot is far from being legitimately interesting. ambiguity works well for most of the game, but once the curtain is finally lifted, there is shockingly little. final word playing through inside is a wholly unique experience due to its unparalleled sense of atmosphere and the escalating tension that comes from the twisted, mysterious nature of its world. however, once the mysteries unravel to the extent that they can be, it becomes clear in retrospect that the story and puzzles lack substance. final score 8.2"
Puzzle,Inside,2018-02-18,"genious game, incredibly minimalistic and although that great fun. the atmosphere is genious, very dark and depressive. the light and shadow elements made some scenes very beautiful, good graphic engine. the atmosphere fits perfectly to the story, which is an art, you dont get any intro, not text, you understand the story just by looking at your surroundings. gameplay is very simple run,jump,grab. just like the whole game, it is very minimalistic. but with such few possibilities you get many interesting puzzles. the only bad thing of this game steam... no retail version"
Puzzle,Inside,2018-01-20,i think that this is truly a unique game and i would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then i think you should give this game a try.

Puzzle,Inside,2017-08-02,"inside was good but not great, i really liked playdead's previous work limbo but unfortunately i found this game dissapointing. the story was fine, i will admit that it's very clever, it does have some interesting themes and meaning and there is a big reveal did shock me... unfortunately the game's reveal came in the last 30 minutes, i know that the game was just a build up for this reveal but i didn't think that it was a great payoff. it did took me by surprise but this final level was boring, annoying and just dragged on and i wanted it to end, so i'm conflicted on the story, it's really smart but just didn't think that the payof was worth it. the gameplay was just like limbo but it has more fluid  weaker puzzles, i found these puzzles to be boring and repetitive, i found that sad because i loved limbo's puzzles but they were really underwhelming in inside. i heard people say that this game found this game powerful in this story, i don't necessarily agree but i do see where they are coming from, it touches themes of individualism and i can defenitily see why someone would love this game, i just didn't thought that the puzzles and boring environnements made the actual payoff worth it, i guess that this game just isn't for me."

Puzzle,Inside,2017-07-16,"this is one of the best games i have ever played. it may seem like it's just another indie game  trust me, it's not. it has a lot of depth and is overall a wellmade game. it's a combination of puzzle and horror genres. puzzles are very unique and never failed me to surprise. puzzles in this game feel differently for some reason, they feel natural and very smooth. there are variety of them, ranging from timing to logic. the way this game achieves the horror feeling is the atmosphere. there are absolutely no cheap jumpscares, which you can find in games like outlast and five nights at freddy's. the sound design also adds to this. graphics and animations are also topnotch and i was shocked when i saw unity's logo in the credits  i didn't expect unity to be able to create such magnificent picture. the only disadvantage of this game is its length. it took me about 4 hours to complete the game even though it took me a while to complete some of the puzzles. then another hour to find all collectibles and achievements. four hours isn't much for me, i wanted to enjoy the game for a longer period of time. in the end, i highly recommend this game to anybody as there is no difficult gameplay and even people who don't play video games will surely enjoy this little masterpiece. 910"
Puzzle,Inside,2017-07-14,"graphically original, not too long, as it should be a good platform. narratively interesting, without words or written, and with a shift towards the mystery rather than horror as limbo. in my opinion, more balanced than the predecessor limbo, who had some puzzles with a little logical and very annoying solution."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-05-11,"that's a 9 out of 10 for me i'm and indie games fan. inside has great atmosphere, visuals and sound design. it is truly a work of art. it is a little too short though and hmm... its ending is not very satisfying. it leaves more questions than answers that's not a bad thing, but it also ends rather suddenly."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-05-10,"good things about inside  i love how minimalistic it is menu, controls, graphic etc. game have it's own style.  gameplay is more diverse and interesting comparing to limbo.  characters are great the boy, security guys, hounds, civilians and the world itself.  absolutely great and impressive atmosphere  story, that you can learn from the world, not from narrator, dialogues or texts. room for improvement  i wish to see some additional aspects besides of secrets and different ending in the game that will make me want to complete it once more. overall great game, will totally recommend, enjoy playing in total darkness."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-05-08,"i didn't like limbo and even if this time i'm going to leave a positive review i didn't like the same things in inside too. this time curiosity gave me a reason to move, solve puzzles, etc, but in the end none of your questions are answered, you just get more and more questions and not a single answer, you can make some educated guess but in the end there are so many explanations given the fact you don't know the rules of this distopian world that each possible explanation won't leave you satisfied enough. that said, everything else on this game is a piece of art, from graphics to music and even more sound effects, controls are just as simple as perfect for this game and mechanics are intriguing and sometimes a bit mindblowing. the setting is some kind of distopian world where i felt orwell's big brother surveillance 1984 and otomo's psychichuman experiments akira as well as nihei's megastructures and elusive creatures blame!, in the darkest possible mix. as i said before i would have loved some explanation of this world how did humanity get to this point, who are you as the player, why are they doing this, etc because in my opinion that would have risen meaningful questions instead of meaningless ones, questions on our world and how could our society become something like inside's distopia. all in all this journey was a positive experience, still i wouldn't recommend this game to many people because it is extremely dark, there's death in the worst meaning possible, and there's even worse than that, so, well, i guess people who liked the 3 works i identified as sources for this game orwell's 1984, otomo's akira and nihei's blame! may enjoy the ride aside from those unanswered questions..., while everyone else should steer away, nothing to gain for you playing this title."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-05-06,"an amazingly atmospheric game that reminds of a mix between limbo and another world. first of  it's a 2.5d platform game that makes a real good use of the 0.5d aspect incorporating in its puzzles and obstacles. there is no word ever spoken in the entire game and the story is what you make of it. you start out in the woods with what looks like being on the run. while on the run you go through different locations solving different puzzles. the atmosphere is the strongest point of this game. it gives out an eerie vibe very much reminding of orwell's 1984. it's dark and unsettling. the visuals are amazing, the super smooth animation helps with the atmosphere and the sound design is top notch. as you progress trough the game all you can do is avoid enemies  and they do feel very scary. scarier than most games i've played in the recent memory. and you're always accompanied by the feeling of being small and alone in a very hostile environment. don't really want to go into details as not to spoil the fun. enough to say  this game is amazing  you should give it a go. not ver long but definitely worth a playthrough."

Puzzle,Inside,2017-02-25,"first i decided to give it 8 mark  the game is amazing but far too dark. now i've changed my mind  this is another example of how modern games should be made today. so here is my points  first of all  plot, it should be in any game, from moba or strategy to rpg or shooter. plot is the most important thing in all games  the game should not be long  620 hours is perfect. no game should be grindy.  gameplay  it should be intuitive and clear i understand there are different games focusing on different points, but as a platformer inside meets all criteria above. ori and the blind forest, super meat boy, bindings of isaac and now inside  that how the games should be made today. as if you live there playing, when you can feel all what happens to your character on your skin. as of inside, this game also reminded me of portal 2  humongous abandoned factories, i could really feel all this fear and loneliness of that boy. to sum it up  10 of 10, perfect game."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-02-06,"tier 1  presents a beautiful and solemn world that is instantly gripping and immersive.  perhaps an odd positive, but this game offers very unique rendering and physics that feel amazing and are just absolutely delightful to watch, especially in the incredible finale. ? some will compliment the spartan story that leaves a lot to the viewer's imagination, but at the end of the day, there is relatively little substance to the storyworld and the content that's there is a lot more obvious than people are apt to let on.  significantly easier than the studio's last title, with fewer mechanics. feels more like an interactive experience than a game by the end."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-22,"easily one of the best and most immersive games i have played in years. this game was exactly the relief i needed, never have i had such a good time playing a sidescroller game. the level of detail and heartpounding action along with some brilliant level design made this an instant classic in the genre."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-09,"inside is a complex take on a gothic 2d platformer. there are several moments during play where i was completely awed and shocked by how innovative and fresh the gameplay felt. playdead successfully creates a macabre universe for the player to explore, with the horror feeling unsettling at many points inside the game. however, at the end of the day, i wasn't really satisfied. i think it comes back to the idea that i play a game to for primarily fun. sure, i also appreciate a riveting plot and cast of characters, but inside really didn't have too much of a story to offer. there is no exposition whatsoever, leaving the user to piece together almost random pieces of a zombie infested story. as corny as this may sound, i found inside to be quite lacking in the fun department. it's a horror game, sure, but it sometimes feels as dry as the inside of the zombie factory itself. to conclude, inside is an interesting game that does many new and innovative things during its rather short gameplay. i'd recommend it to those that are fans of horror games or are really into the indie gaming scene. however, i was overall disappointed after reading such raving reviews online. i found it similar to valve's portal in some ways, but just not as good. portal was funny and refreshing at times. although i realize that the developers had no intention to put any humor in the game, i felt like it could have used a laugh during this bizarre journey through the dark and the drab. inside shines through innovative gameplay, but i push back against the unanimous critical acclaim. it's not as mechanically sound as a platformer like super meat boy, nor is it as intriguing a puzzle game as portal. the plot is all the time a bit vague, and the ending is, in my opinion, just weird. i stand by my 710, and simply wish to warn players not to buy into the hype."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-04,"inside was an experience that stands out among most modern narratives and proves to be incomparable to those similar within the genre. players are dropped in the middle of a completely unique world that is very reminiscent of george orwell's dystopian society in 1984. there is a clear sense of dread emulated throughout the narrative and this is made to be felt quite vividly throughout gameplay. many times throughout navigating the world, paranoia and fear can be felt as threats are so abundant and the world leaves a lingering vulnerability which only leads to enhance the experience. while structurally inside is linear, the puzzles and direction of storytelling make the game compelling. inside uses its gameplay mechanics to enhance and unravel the narrative in a meaningful way that not many other stories have done. a lack of dialogue and sole reliance on the environment empowers the medium in which this story is delivered. this is rare and should be appreciated for its value as an art form and narrative capability. in conclusion, inside succeeds as an experience in terms of inspiring world and art direction combined together delivering a truly unique and incredible story."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-04,"while an amazing graphical story, it's a graphical story. can't call it a game, it's just an interactive story. really short and cool story, heavily scripted and linear, might as swell be a 3d animated movie like one of those pixar movies."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-03,"programming, art, design, sound, every aspect of this game is spectacular. i don't normally like this experienceonrails kind of game. i'm normally a hardcore gameplay junkie that doesn't care much for story. but inside blew me away. i took the time to find all the secrets on my own."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-02,"the most overrated game of 2016. 4 hours of pushing blocks, flipping switches and hiding in shadows. mediocre gameplay mechanics on a black and white sidescroller that pushed every hipster hot button. while not a bad game per se, just more of a 4.99 indie title than the holy grail everyone is making it out to be."
Puzzle,Inside,2017-01-01,"it was too short, but it was pretty great. it makes you think and still leaves you a bit confused. good pacing, nice puzzles, and a good story despite zero dialogue. another gem for sure."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-12-25,"five word review equal parts insane and brilliant favorite thing how things progressively get weird, never stopping until it goes critically insane. least favorite thing the ending was a big disappointment. playtime 3h enjoyment 910 recommendation most definitely"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-12-24,"this is the most overhyped game of 2016. i love limbo,but this game give nothing more  no story,no new gamemechanic. it has good atmosphere and 4 hours of gameplay. game offers no new experience, it's success only because of limbo. 6.510"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-12-21,"this is art and creativity, everything we beg from the big studios is delivered to us in this simple 34 hour game. i really liked it it was so beautiful. the gameplay although simple at first becomes really really enjoyable with twists and turns you wont expect. the puzzles are not very challenging but they are still very rewarding to complete. as a gamer i really recommend you try this out. we cant only play the triple a games like battlefield dota 2 elderscrolls tomb raider etc. these small games can be the best ones if your in the right mood and can get into them. this game was so refreshing from the predictable triple a games i usually play. although i will say there is nothing really game changing about this game. its just the creativity and seeing new ideas and ways to play that make it so refreshing. i recommend you play it 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-12-07,"masterpiece! this is best indi game of the 2016 year. thanks playdead, this this game will be platinum soon. i will wait your great games again!!! sorry for my english"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-31,"pretty good atmospheric platformer. impressive real physics, great sound. i enjoyed the puzzles. what really makes it different is the darkness and creepiness. it is fairly short, but enjoyable."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-30,"this game is reminiscent of older puzzleplatformers such as little big adventure and abe's odyssey. the puzzles are well designed, but lack a bit in creativity and challenge. the story is virtually nonexistent and this is something that is hard to overlook. the lore is indeed intriguing, and the atmosphere is quite immersive, but that alone cannot make up for its lack of narrative  this is very much a case of the author, trying too hard to achieve intellectual appeal through sheer abstraction. that said, this game must be commended for its fantastic visual design as well as its top of the class animations. the visual locations do become repetitive, and a times the walking sequences stretch for a little long. the action and gameplay flows very nicely, and the game runs quite smoothly. inside is a very competent game, an exquisite piece of interactive design, that ultimately fails at telling a compelling story while challenging the player in fun creative ways"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-25,"it's an experiencelike puzzle game where the puzzles aren't too hard for even casual players to solve and the art is so great that just about any frame in the game could be a painting. the good  as said, excellent art style. i was frequently asking myself how did they do this? i mean, technically it's unity game engine, but still, i imagine tons of artists' work must have gone into every scene there.  a geat depressing feel of being powerless, hunted down, oppressed. the game shows a soulless industrial world, with mindcontrolled bodies of humans, dead pigs and huge empty hangars and warehouses  pretty nice sound there is practically no music here but the sounds are very atmospheric  sirprisingly complex and natural animations of characters  dunno how they did this either  tons of innovative, truly original scripted sequences and puzzles which i have never seen anywhere else! this leaves an impression that they simply didn't allow any mediocre design idea into the game. the soso  lack of story! there is a general feeling of a story happening, and a very strange ending. i went online searching for an explanation of the ending, thinking i may have not paid attention during play or was too unsophisticated to decypher it  but instead of a clear explanation i just found multiple theories about who mind controls whom etc. seriously, people, artists use this trick to make you think their work is more deep that it actually is. the devs don't know themselves what they wanted to say, which means there is no story there. instead, there are vague and contradicting clues, signs and mininarratives inserted at random to make you curious. these theories and discussions they need just to get some buzz around the game. don't fall for that trick. if the creator has a clear story in mind, he tells it directly and clearly. and if you see a vague piece like this be sure the creator himself has no clue. anyway, this isn't really a bad thing. whatever. it feels too artsy and a bit too cheap of a trick to me. but they are in their own right here as artists. maybe i'm just a too logical mathsci type for this. still, i did enjoy the feeling and the overall setting of the game, even if there is no story.  a somewhat too linear style of puzzles  frequently i would solve them just by doing the only things possible, only realizing the idea behind the puzzle after solving it. which still may be ok for casual players who don't like harder games ? the bad  truly, i found none. my respect to denmark has grown after seeing what its game developers can create. hats off to you guys."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-25,"mysterious and detailed environment, intelligent and original puzzles but not extremely hard, a secret alternative ending, and the best puzzle of all the story itself, which will make you try to decipher if for days after you finish it. if you are looking for a game you won't forget a couple of weeks after finishing it, then this one is a must buy. probably the best 2d puzzleplatform game i've ever played."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-18,"there's so much content now, we're truly spoilt. i often wonder if i'm not as passionate about gaming as i used to be. then boom! a game like inside is released and makes me realise that yes, there's lots of content but not so much great content. i completed this game in 2 sittings, those 2 sitting were not that long either. 16 is the cost for 4 hours amazing entertainment. i'll spend the same on food that i devour in half an hour. so for me, worth it. the art style is fantastic. it really makes you think, to try and understand what is going on. i'm guessing everyone will have their own thoughts and most of them will be different but i think that adds to the charm. i'd really recommend this game. an easy 10 for me. thanks, playdead."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-18,"what an excellent game that is very unique in its approach and game play. aside from the gorgeous gorgeous visuals, and immersive environment that really gets you attached to the character and some situations emotional disturbed by some of the going on's in the game, the puzzles are very creative and varied enough that you don't feel like your doing similar puzzles. with some intuitive thinking, they are also not that difficult to the point where you just get plain frustrated. this isn't a triple a title, or a game backed up with a huge budget, but for what it is, it is simply amazing. it does suffer from lack of 'repalyability', but your really just going to play this game for the one time experience anyway."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-06,"this game plays with the mind and the emotions of the gamer like a clockwork. absolute masterpiece with so many metanarrative implications, that will keep us reflecting about the story, the role of the player and the act of gaming for decades."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-03,"its simplicity is its biggest strength. a simple control, graphics, sound, but a brutal and astonishing ending. an open ending that will leave you thinking whaaaaat have i been playing for 34 hours??!?!?!?!. masterpiece."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-01,"this game is a great experience. started playing and finished in 2 days, just wanted to play it!! it does everything in an amazing way. i'm only a bit disappointed it's so short. i would have given it a 9 or 10 if it was a bit longer.."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-10-01,"let me say this you are playing this game for the visuals, not the puzzles. puzzles are very easy, far easier than limbo's so if you are looking for a challenge this game is not for you. story is easier to follow than limbo's, yet it's another anticlimax ending... anyway, compared with limbo, graphics is much more polished and is the best part of the game. there is also more diversity in the environment. this game feels more like a film especially in the final 20 minutes of the game. giving this a 7 because like limbo, this game is very overpriced. it should not cost more than 10usd."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-29,"it is good to see how indie titles are offering great experiences like this one. inside a good game with great graphics, an amazing artstyle with a dark tone and unique puzzles. my only complaint is that the game puts no effort in trying to explain the story of the game. it neither leaves you clues about the plot nor does it let you find any, which leaves you surprised, confused and clueless about the ending. the ending is dark, twisting and disturbing one of the weirdest endings i've seen in a game. 710"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-28,"tldr i was bored even by the 'crazy' or 'cool' parts. i get the 'deeper' meanings behind the game, but i wouldn't have payed 20 for this game had i known it was so shallow overall. i felt legitimately scammed by this game considering how easy and short it was. this is a scenario that makes me think sony should make exceptions with its digital refund policy. despite the beautiful art and sound in the game, i'd rather own a 20 poster, or have a good dinner, than have played this game only to be disappointed and delete it from my ps4. considering the 20 pricepoint for this game, i was very disappointed. especially after reading so many glowing reviews, including journalists who got to play it before its release saying,holy crap this game is crazy. i was exited to find that moment where my mind would be blown and i'd get some sort of rush, but that never came. the ending was interesting, but most of the game was literally just really slow puzzles that didn't take skill or intelligence, but time. the game would've been even shorter than it's 34 hour content if we didn't have to backtrack or wait around standing still to solve 90 of the puzzles. i could go on. in my 4 years as a playstation customer this was the first time i ever looked up the refund policy sony has on digital content which is basically 'no'. i still wish i could get my money back, it took me 3 separate sessions to finish this really short game, solely because i got bored after any consecutive hour of playing it, and only completed it since my money was a sunk cost at that point."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-25,"inside by playdead is one of the best platformers i've played so far and could potentially my best game of 2016. inside keeps the player on the edge of their seats the whole time with constant suspense and puzzles which are done perfectly well to keep the player interest in the game without boredom. throughout the journey, you play as the boy who is the protagonist of an uncertain story and confusing plot. the ending can be confusing for many people including me, and it will make you cringe, trust me. the performance is flawless and locked at 60fps without a single bug, glitch or crash. the performance enhances your experience significantly due to the tense story and challenging puzzles awaiting to be solved. i have a decent gaming laptop, and it runs perfectly so if you're worried about the performance and unsure of whether you can run it or not, you can put that thought to oblivion. sound and graphics are amazing and also a factor of which this game is amazing and worth its price. the level of detail of the sound and also what you see visually is just shockingly good for a platformer like inside. just simply, buy this game."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-25,"a moving and dark game that hits you hard in the face, in a good way. i enjoyed every second of it and i really didn't want it to end. it is very surreal and when my partner asked me what i was playing my reply was i have no idea. it is indeed the maturer big brother of its predecessor limbo."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-23,"a work of art and it does exactly what all works of art should do, it makes you think. without a single line of text to be found this side scrolling platformer still hides a surprisingly deep message for those who can find it. unfortunately i fear the symbolism will pass many by, despite what this looks like it's not a casual game. my advice don't take it at face value, the gameplay is fantastic but it can be much more than just a smooth playing platformer if you let it. play it alone from start to finish in a dark room."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-19,"inside is a dark, kinda creepy and such a good platform  puzzle game. even if its story is not clear, i think there are some important social messages  which are still discussed. puzzles are not that hard, not that easy, neither. its atmosphere will definitely make you want to play it to death."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-15,"it's a shot, cheap, 2.5d game... and i couldn't recommend it more, it's a  masterpiece, the game has a deep although not very explained story, even with no dialog at all in the whole game! the story and awesome gameplay that resembles limbo same developer just makes you want to keep playing 'till the end! i only gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because of the ending, the story is awesome, but the ending left a whole lot of very important lore questions without answer, some people like having no answer and formulate a lot of theories around a game, but i'm not like that, i like having the answers and just admiring how great a story is, i hate to see a lot of theories and think how one is possible or not, with no concrete answer of what the  the ending was... but as i said, its just a masterpiece, even if you don't like vague endings like me, buy it, it's very probable that you won't regret it!"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-07,"i've started playing and couldn't stop. the game from the very beginning was very intriguing, and it kept me going forward. i was very curious how the story will unfold. the games music and graphic style is very good. the idea for the game is exceptional and the creators of this piece deserve a huge praise. one of the best games i've played in my 25 years of gaming."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-07,"by far one of the best games i have played in my life. but you can't compare it with 'normal' games on the market. this game lives from its artistic approach. its a piece of art and should be judged from this point of view. yes, its too easy and yes its short, but if you like strange films like from jim jarmusch or terry gilliam you will love this game. there are a lot of references and the atmosphere is just magic and disturbing at the same time. best setting is to play it on surround and on a big screen beamer. and yes it has an open ending but in my opinion this is one of the best parts of the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-09-06,"from the very first scenes where these creepy adults start chasing this poor alone kid through the woods, and i found myself caught up in this kid's plight, wanting to know what the heck was going on and stop him getting killed. the sinister world and story shows you more and more as you progress, and it really is a twisted world they have created. i thoroughly enjoyed this game, the puzzles were challenging enough to make you think, but shouldnt get too many people stuck, and the graphics and physics are perfectly done, but it was more about the adventure and unravelling plot for me. i reckon it's a great game and i've already recommended it to several friends."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-29,just finished this game.i liked it very  very dark and clever game which takes you on awesome journey. this is one of the games that you need to finish twice with your brain working at 100 to understand.
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-29,"developerz, listen here when you making story there should be one. something like  once upon a time there were old man and old woman and they did not have a kids. one day they found a small mouse and they dicided this mouse to be their kid. but one day the mouse felt in the soup and they were very very sad. there!!! here is your story and plot. from now on you can do whatever you want inside. you can make the mouse punk and die from the broken glass or modest guy who died from vengeance cat. whatever! but we have a plot. you, unlike my little story  do not have one! you are just pretentious. that's it. nothing to show just some stupid idea without beginning and end. the atmosphere in your game is spreading over 140 km of factorylike levels without end and even slightest effort to be changed. so called puzzles are just padding the game and our time. the end that should explain something or be shocking to us after 30 seconds is hilarious and obnoxiously stupid. we even lost our faceless protagonist in the process with whom we actually have to have relationship... ah, it is pointless to tell how terrible this game is. but is not pointless to tell the others to dont buy this crap. give your money to some homeless person at least he will have food for a day. as for this garbage, go on youtube and see for yourself."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-27,"a wacky, fun game to play! for me, the puzzle is really intelligent and the guy who made this game is very shrewd i gotta admit! once again, playdead has scored another game. keep it up!"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-26,"wow, what a game! it's a master piece. gameplay its similar to limbo but everything higher. there aren't objetives, just going ahead and solving puzzles, but you can't stop playing. pros superb visuals  ambient sounds  atmosphere  lots of clever and varied puzzles no repetitive at all  movements it remembered me the old prince of persia of 90's  the final part of the game is great very funny  etc cons easy puzzles but challenging  no story  the ending  it's short but it's worth"

Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-22,astonishing. i always wondered why the game took so long to produce. now i know. hollywood level production values. the cutting edge at your fingertips. game of the decade. best experience since shadow of the colossus. well done playdead.
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-22,"this is a lesson in quality over quantity, but a lesson that leaves you hungry for more! sublime piece of video game design all around the board. the atmosphere and tension that is put into this game is of a detail rarely seen. the beautiful visuals and pacing will blow many players away within the first few scenes"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-16,"nice game, but way to easy. limbo was more demanding. too bad they emphasized more on graphics rather on challenging puzzles. i was fun but very short and easy. i still give it 7 points because it had an intense atmosphere and ripping off the tail of a pig was something really weird."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-10,"this game plays with the mind and the emotions of the gamer like a clockwork. absolute masterpiece with so many metanarrative implications, that will keep us reflecting about the story, the role of the player and the act of gaming for decades."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-07,"horrible anticlimactic ending. i'm not gonna lie, i was very intrigued while playing this. i think i've never been this intrigued for a game in my life. things seem to get weirder and weirder the more you play it and it seems like the only reason i kept playing this was to see how it was gonna end. i can safely say i was disappointed."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-07,"sadly this game is purely visual fodder. there is no story here, and nothing is explained. the game does manage to build up a pretty good climax but it has no payoff whatsoever. stories are meant to have a beginning, a middle, and an end and follow the story chart of an intro, rising action, climax, and ending. this game has an intro, rising action, climax. there is no ending here. except for the fact that the game no longer allows you to play. its sad to see really. the games visuals were amazing and it had some amazing atmosphere. but its all for nothing if there is no substance."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-04,"a very easy and short platformerpuzzle game with a cryptic story and some great visuals. it's good, definitely worth a playthrough, but obviously not deserving of the insane praise it's getting. maybe get it when the price drops to 10 or 5 dollars."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-08-02,"inside is short. inside costs 20. i would have paid 30. playdead took what they learned from limbo and created a masterpiece that surprised me more than any game ever has. when limbo was released i heard a lot of good things. when i got around to playing it, i was slightly disappointed. it was good, but i was left wanting more. inside has a much more interesting world and characters. playdead spent more than five years putting together a five hour experience. this development time allowed them to polish every inch of the world to perfection. in a world of glitch filled messes that sell millions of copies, inside is an extremely refreshing departure from the norm. the new puzzle mechanics, although not too difficult, are unique and fun. inside's final twenty minutes can only be described as extraordinary. give this game a chance, you won't be disappointed."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-29,"second fail in a row from devs of this game looks like tradition story has no beginning and no ending, after 4 hours you know nothing. they say this is is all for your imagination, but real reason we just have no plot, sorry gameplay just poor, graphics are much worse and no plot. rating mustnt play"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-21,"mindblowingly wonderful. intuitive puzzles, a compelling atmosphere that is both horrifying and yet conjures up unexpected moments of comedy, along with an absolutely top tier art style all combine to make inside one of the very best games of the year. is it short? yes. but unlike tripe like the order 1886, inside makes every single second a complete joy to play and is one of the most tightly made games i've ever played. pick this up, you won't regret it."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-19,"this game is an visual achievement in interactive art, the dystopian setting draws you in from beginning to end and the animations is the smoothest i've seen since journey. there is no doubt this is an masterpiece and needs to be experienced!"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-17,"a actual artistic achievement in gaming. establishes an amazing mood, has gameplay that is engaging and helps establish the universe of the game. builds to a great payoff with a twist near the ending. and the third act is like a cross between dark scifi and a beckett play. it's a game where my friends have discussed the ending and debated its meaning for hours. good stuff."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-16,"the game is a pure masterpiece in terms of both atmospheric design and technical implementation. the final part is jawdropping, i was literally shocked at the end. but the game is too short. only three hours is a crime for such beautifull piece of art. pleeeease i want more!"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-16,"it was short but it was awesome. me and my friends all love limbo and when this came out, i bought it day one, we gathered together and completed it in 23 hours. some people would complain about the length, but for me it just was really really good experience and i don't have much time to spend on video games these days, so i like when they don't take too much."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-12,"the game is awesome. it really gets you inside the game got it?. but seriously, the game is really good. instead of giving answers, it just gives you more questions and gets you thinking why, when, or what. the graphics are also stunning, they fit very well to the theme of the game. well, it was created by the same people of limbo, so what did you expect?"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-11,"i had a pretty ok time with the puzzles, all of which are environmental, but the story being so arthousey turned me off. you get no closure just questions. the best part of the game is the discussion around it but that, in my mind, does not make a game great so i just think it is ok."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-11,"inside is an intriguing, dark and twisted story that will no doubt leave you wanting more. the game play mechanics are solid and responsive and overall represent a more satisfying experience than limbo not that the latter was disappointing in any way. it is visually stunning  especially in the underwater scenes  and introduces background threats in a novel and satisfying way, creating a greater sense of immersion within the scenery. at the same time, however, i often found this frustrating as puzzlesolving and movement in general is confined solely to two dimensions, so that i'd often find myself trying to differentiate between what was accessible and what was merely scenery when considering how to move forward. the story is compelling from the start but asks many more questions than it answers, which may or may not be a good thing. personally i enjoy having something to discuss after the game, whereas my partner who played with me strictly prefers the closure of a narrative upon completion. either way, the experience is unique and it gives a lot of food for thought. at the price i can understand that many people would end up dissatisfied with the product. personally, i think this just depends on what you want to get out of the game. if you want a world to lose yourself in and to play in day after day, then this obviously isn't for you. but if you're looking for an evening of fantastic and unique entertainment, then this is something you really should try."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-10,"this is a lesson in quality over quantity, but a lesson that leaves you hungry for more! sublime piece of video game design all around the board. the atmosphere and tension that is put into this game is of a detail rarely seen. the beautiful visuals and pacing will blow many players away within the first few scenes completely captivating them and dragging them into a bizarre and dark world. yes, the game is short but you won't get bored and it won't feel like a chore to play. the levels always have lots going on and are a testament to storytelling without words or text. i'm still inclined to give this title a 1010 despite its brevity everything in the game is clearly well thought out and a real joy to play."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-10,"i've heard it compared a lot to limbo, but really its just because their are so few titles that are comparable to it from the last ten years. out of this world and heart of darkness are more apt comparisons honestly. they were classics, they were truly ahead of their time. however, in 2016, inside feels more like a little bit of this and a little bit of that as far as an actual videogame goes it feels like it doesn't have its own identity whatsoever. it has very simple mechanics, the puzzles are not difficult and the plot is barely there. something about a boy running, or sneaking into some type of facility and some nonsensical science fiction vignettes ensue. you might even go as far as to say that the entire game is a series of vignettes. one long way from point a to point b. its not a rewarding final destination though, it may be in fact the only thing that makes inside totally unreplayable. its a three hour experience, with lots of vague unexplained things that happen or that you'll see, only to end with no explanation and a very dissatisfying credit roll that might even make you sit there thinking is that really it? i have a very hard time giving this a good score, as it was twenty dollars for a three hour single player 2.5d walking simulator that i couldn't even justify playing through again. i was however, riveted on my first playthrough at least until the terrible ending. i believe that if a larger studio or developer had worked on something of this caliber, artistically speaking, they would have no doubt invested more time into fleshing out plot ideas and elements into a cohesive story rather than a cluttered idea soup that it unfortunately came out to be. that is not to say that their aren't very good ideas here, quite simply there are, but since they lack structure they aren't being conveyed to the player correctly. the games presentation suffers immensely from these poorly constructed ideas that are not even capable of telling a proper story. their are so many unrelated, baffling, and pointless things in inside that its a little disconcerting to see people praising it as much as they are. its not unwarranted praise though, but its certainly not immune to having its flaws pointed out either. i hope to see better projects from this studio in the future, however until they offer more to the experience, beyond a nice visual style, solid atmosphere and a few scattered emotional high points i wouldn't spend another penny on one of their products."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-09,"inside is absolutely amazing. limbo was an absolute masterpiece, so i was shocked when i got into inside and realized playdead had somehow improved on what was already perfect. i will not say anything about the game specifically, because i believe going in as blind as possible is best for the experience, as well as playing through it in one sitting it took me roughly 4 hours to beat the first time."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-09,"inside is a solid game. though, i will have to give it a 7 and not a score higher for a few reasons it's very short, and the the story is a little too ambiguous for my tastes. the mattefinish art style is something to be appreciated, as well as the fluid movement and procedural character animations, but all of what made inside different and interesting started to become stale within the first hour, and the game was over 2 hours later."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-08,"inside looks like a revamp of its predecessor limbo, with a slightly different graphic style, colorful but even darker if possible, drown in a haunting and eerie atmosphere that remindined me of orwell's 1984, otomo's akira and even jules verne. on the technical side it's a real gem, the only complaint i could make is it's rather easy and in a few hours it will end with a powerful, unpredicted ending nonetheless"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-08,"a game like inside with 78 hours of gameplay would have been my favorite game of all time. as its shorter, it just takes a place in my top10. a true little atmospheric masterpiece. thank you playdead for making me feel i will never stop gaming no matter my age. 10"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-08,"great game, but it got one big stupid mistake which the game dev's should be ashamed of   denuvo. i mean srsly? smart people won't buy games with that  denuvo sht. another great game ruined by the dev's greed to make it not crackable. clap clap, you made it. be proud of yourself."
Puzzle,Inside,2016-07-07,"it should first be noted that this review is written by a huge fan of limbo. i played that game to deathgot every achievement, showed it to all my friendsthe works. as such, this will be less of an overview of inside generally, but rather a comparison of the similarities and differences between limbo and inside. as an aside, it should be noted that the game mechanics of these two games are almost identical. the same jumping, pushing, and climbing mechanics in inside are basically identical to limbo, with minor control improvements for example, holding up no longer causes you to continually jump, sparing you accidental jumping after you land or reach the top of a ladder. there are also at least two new mechanics in inside. both games also feature secret areas, which appeals to completionists like myself. as far as gameplay goes, limbo was unfair. it would teach you one thing and then kill you for doing it in the next puzzle, or throw a long platforming section at you that required near perfect execution to live through it, or a puzzle that requires you to do a few actions and then wait a very specific amount of time before continuing, or die. and the pacing was quick, and often, the player's execution had to be precise. there was an achievement to get through the game with five or less deaths. with a few notable exceptions, the puzzles in limbo come more or less back to back. overall, the gameplay was quick, precise, and memorizationbased. the first notable thing about inside is its 2.5d graphics. at first, i thought this was aesthetic only, but i found that puzzles incorporate the background quite a lot, and in a very effective way. in 2d, if you have an enemy chasing you that's far faster than you, you have to use audio cues to let the player know that something is chasing them. in 2.5d, you can have the enemy appear visually in the background, and the player can see how fast it is moving, and anticipate when they will have to take action. it's actually a really neat way to present information to the player. on that note, the puzzles on inside are largely predictable, so unlike in limbo, many of the puzzles can be accomplished on the first try. the pacing of inside is considerably slower than in limbo. it takes about 45 minutes to get through limbo if you know all the puzzles and are going at a reasonable pace. inside takes closer to an hour and a half, largely due to long sections where you are just holding down one key to run, sometimes for almost a minute at a time. that is not to say this is time wasted, as inside is a considerably more aesthetic game, whereas limbo is more stylized, though both are more or less monochromatic. inside also has a vague sort of storyline, which develops mostly through environmental cues throughout the game. to conclude, i was not as impressed with inside as i was with limbo. the gameplay of inside was fun, but not often very engaging, since there was a lot of downtime where you just run and look at the pretty visuals, and consider what's going on in the story. i'm still recommending inside to some close friends as a oncethrough sort of game, but it's not the sort of game i'm going to obsess over like i did with limbo."
