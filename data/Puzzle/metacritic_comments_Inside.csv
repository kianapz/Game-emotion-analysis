Tonantzintla618,2024-12-22,100,"The very best puzzle platformer I've ever played, I've lost count how many runs on this I've had."
zyllus,2024-12-07,100,"It is a great game, the gameplay is simple but fun and challenging. PlayDead sure does know how to make a proper game with open endings leaving it to player to interpret it. Loved it throughout."
RodrigoKosteski,2024-11-28,100,Jogasso indie! A história e a gameplay são muito redondas. Me prendeu do início ao fim e o plot do fim é muito bom.
Henrytas,2024-11-21,90,"Tan bueno como Limbo (siendo de los mismos creadores), pero más largo, más complejo y con un toque de color, pese a lo cual es aún más siniestro y opresivo. Por ponerle una pega, decir que te explica poco del universo del juego y te tienes que montar tu propia película, lo cual es un hándicap para los que tenemos poca **** definitiva, un grandísimo juego que no puedes dejar de jugar, salvo que te moleste usar las neuronas"
tkiet1,2024-09-30,60,"Game should never strives to be movie. Ever. The obsecurity has to come with engaging gameplay. Inside, on the other hand, has a trial and error bloated repetitiveness that refrains players from any genuine preparation or challenging problem solving. Also, there is a fake sense of intensity with each tom&jerry chase this games forces you to. Though there are strong moments, it does not help the game to escape mediocrity."
queenscrow,2024-08-17,80,"Oyunda dilin pek bir önemi olmasa da türkçe dil desteği var. Atmosfer olsun oynanış olsun gergin bir yapısı var. Özellikle köpek kovalama sekansları çok gericiydi. Yönettiğimiz elemanın ekstra salak olup havada zıplarken bir şeyleri tutamıyor oluşu, sonu hak ettiğnin göstergesiydi. Gamepass denoynadım. Bir günde bitti kısa ve tatlı bir oyun"
BigYeedus,2024-07-27,90,Keeps the same intriguing puzzles and creepy vibe of LIMBO while vastly improving the storytelling. The ending will drop your jaw to the floor.
check2wice,2024-07-08,50,"this game was boring to me, I'm not sure why so many people like it. puzzles are not that interesting to me"

Nyst,2023-07-29,90,I loved this game until I didn't anymore. The ending fell completely flat with me.
Xi_Jinping,2024-03-23,80,"At first, I thought it was a game to manipulate Jewish boys to escape from **** human laboratory."
paolinoang,2024-02-08,80,"I really enjoyed this title a lot. I started it without knowing what to expect, but I was immediately impressed by the graphics and gameplay. It's definitely not a game I would play again, but an A run is a must. Very nice."
Markltv,2024-01-27,100,"A real escape from reality into the haunting, daunting world of Inside. I was stunned."
dogukansapmz,2024-01-27,70,Arka taraflardan hissettirdiği o kaliteli hikaye ve minik bulmacalarla vakit geçirebileceğiniz orjinal bir dünyaya sahip bir oyun. Öneriyorum 🅖🅤🅜🅤🅢
philzlz,2024-01-20,80,Fun game that was a bit too short. I felt the puzzles were too easy but the story and atmosphere were top notch and the game had a creepy vibe.
Lightolights,2024-01-18,100,"A true masterpiece, a model for every independent game. Wildly imaginative plot, beautifully designed puzzle"
Umur,2021-05-30,30,It isn't a bad game it's just the fact that I didn't like it. When i played i felt bored and i just waited for it to end.
Younix,2023-12-18,70,"I enjoyed this game, but I don't see it as the masterpiece many others say it is. The puzzles are fun, the world is interesting and some of the more unnerving moments really land, but I can't see past much of what it just presents. Nonetheless, I'd definitely recommend this puzzle or horror enthusiasts!"
n4m3l3ss0n3,2023-12-04,80,"I liked Limbo more, but this is still a very good game. If only it was (just like Limbo) a bit longer. 3-4 hours is just too short for my taste."
Poccigoni,2023-10-31,70,"Inside keeps you interested at all time. The ambience and art style are top notch, Unfortunately, the game's story is so open it doesn't even give a general direction, and it leaves the player with absolutely no idea about what happened. I feel like some more story hints would have made this an amazing game, and while it's still good, it would be delusional to give it a 9 or a 10."
GoldenBigby,2023-10-24,90,the greatest 3 hours
DURISTIKA,2023-10-21,90,In the game I am literally: #manipulator #puppeteer #manipulation #interests
XxKrackonxX,2023-10-06,90,"انسايد قدمة تجربة سوداية آسره , تقديم الفن قاتم و مخيف بنفس الوقت مشبع لفضول و رغبة التعرض لهذا النوع من الرعب الفريد"
OniGioRi,2023-09-07,90,"Inside looks like a really simple game but it's really deep and entertaining. Loved challenging puzzles and idea behind the game. To me this game represents the ""rat race"" people are in nowadays. Time by time society acts like programmed machines, doing same things day by day and slowly all the emotions and happiness we felt back in the days fade away. Fortunately there are still people left who try to stay away from society's standards and they prefer to live their life in their own way. That's exactly what I saw in Inside and it does a great job in showing you all that."
Blue9710x,2023-08-27,100,Inside is a masterpiece with a claustrophobic atmosphere and clever puzzle design.
Richard_dias,2023-08-15,80,This one was interesting. Intriguing world with nice visuals and good gameplay!
Prometheus1241,2023-07-31,80,"Nice atmosphere, gameplay and platforming. The plot is really enjoyable, and might not be understood by you firstly, but when you would analyse it... you still will not understand a ****"
Alperen007,2023-07-31,80,"Lovely indie puzzle-platformer. Well designed ambients, puzzles and references on human life."
Seathate,2023-07-30,70,"Biraz overrated buldum. Güzel bir atmosfer, eğlenceli bulmacalarla iyi vakit geçirtmiş olsa da bir noktadan sonra bitsin de gideyim dedirtti."
MeKAnehS0,2023-07-12,100,"Beautiful graphics, beautiful lighting, beautiful music, great level design, intellectual and cool gameplay, beautiful story. I think it's one of the best mind games I've ever played, this game scared me badly"
Sarabi,2023-06-26,80,"I liked this game and I advise you to try it, there is nothing more to add!"
Mastereed,2023-06-12,80,"INSIDE THE BRAIN’S PUZZLE BEFORE WE START: Inside is a Puzzle-Platform video game developed by Playdead and published on June 29, 2016. The game was completed 100% on Xbox Series X. BREAKING IN: Inside is an extremely linear title based on silent storytelling through the game's continuous animated backgrounds. The early gameplay stages do not differ much from what the player will encounter throughout the entirety of the story, allowing them to face any adversity from the beginning. Most of the mechanics are highly intuitive, thanks to the simplicity of the usable buttons, the jump and the grab. The dark and macabre setting of the story is easily discernible from the initial deaths, which are quite easy to come across due to the non-trivial difficulty of this title. OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE: As mentioned earlier, with limited interaction buttons, Inside focuses on the complexity of its puzzles, which are almost always distinct from one another but interconnected enough to prevent the player from feeling disoriented. Some sections of the game are quite challenging to overcome without experiencing fatalities, but as it relies partially on trial and error, they never become frustrating or predictable, aided by a multitude of death animations. As the title suggests, the mechanic on which many puzzles revolve is the ability to control other humanoids by entering their bodies, utilized for both platforming sections and structured puzzles. In addition to the extremely linear story, there are several collectibles that lead to highly crafted secondary areas. FADING TO BLACK: Graphically, Inside blends a minimalistic style, employing flat colors and graphics, with a 3D approach characterized by a pronounced depth of field and rich details. The story is entirely conveyed through events in the background or foreground, with people interacting with the game environment or the player themselves, often pursuing them to capture. The background, therefore, is not merely a passive element to observe but always interactive with the current gameplay situation the player is trying to complete. THAT BARK: The audio component is relatively straightforward, with background soundtracks suitable for each passage. BUT WHY 8? PROS: The extreme simplicity of Inside is one of its defining characteristics, making it a relaxing and fast-paced game to play. Furthermore, the puzzles are never predictable or boring, nor too difficult or frustrating. Additionally, the story is as simple as it is effective. CONS: The lack of a noteworthy soundtrack is a significant drawback for such an authorial game, making certain areas feel rather bare and playable without audio with few issues and shortcomings. Additionally, at times, the game feels too linear, with levels that give a sense of déjà vu. RATINGS: Gameplay: 8.5 Music: 7 Story: 7 Puzzles: 8.5 _"
o1nk,2023-06-05,80,"Игра стартует сразу после запуска, без всяких катсцен и повествования. Свобода толкования сюжета полностью лежит на игроке. Минимализм музыки и звуков - отличная фишка игры, которая погружает в темный и мрачный мир. Все лучшее было взято из Limbo и улучшено здесь. Визуал и механики также исполнены замечательно."
gold,2023-05-28,90,"В разы лучше Limbo! Анимация опять лучшее что есть в игре, но графика, камера и сюжет (надо же) не отстают. Головоломки стали В РАЗЫ проще, но и лучше вписываются в локации. Я доволен. 9/10"
iceay22,2023-05-28,100,"best game i ever played lkokojk,ujggg ggggggggggg g gggggg ggg ggjj ku ha"
Wiezzel,2023-04-23,100,"Like Limbo this is a true Masterpiece from the same devs. I am always amazed as this is not the kind of game I play but it is REALLY good. Worth the full price and especially if on sale. it is a puzzle spooky game with a some background story to it, that is up to you to understand. The game inspiration was what drew me to it. ( representing a boy escaping a concentration camp in WW2 germany) was the inspiration for this game ( i learned it after starting it, once I knew I really wanted to continue and finish it) I have not been able to finish it since I am stuck atm but REALLY, try it out."
Christian_TV,2023-04-15,90,One of the best indie games ever **** art-style it's incredible and everything is just so perfectly mixed. An absolute gem to play and re-play
bar0yka,2023-03-18,90,manyak ötesi bir oyun kesinlikle herkesin oynaması geren yapım bravo .
BulgarianCritic,2023-03-18,80,"A really atmospheric game which has a decent amount of puzzles that sometimes require a lot of trial and error to finish. The story can be interpreted in different ways (I literally have zero idea wtf happens by the end. It does get a bit when you mostly move to the right side the entire time but some of ""run for your life"" moments were genuine nice. Get it at full price!"
tadnid,2023-03-18,50,"I honestly found this one to be much overrated as an experience. It's not bad, it's certainly not outstanding either."
cursedsoulless,2023-03-06,90,"Este juego aún no lo eh jugado o completado, así que pondré una reseña y nota diferentes cuando lo haga."
azor_4e,2023-03-05,100,"INSIDE is a masterpiece of game design that will leave you breathless and speechless. The game is a stunning visual and auditory experience that immerses you in a dark and dystopian world where you control a young boy who must escape from a mysterious facility. The game is full of clever puzzles, tense moments, and shocking twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The game has no dialogue or text, but it tells a powerful and emotional story through its brilliant animation and sound design. The game is also incredibly polished and smooth, with no bugs or glitches to ruin the immersion. INSIDE is a game that you have to play to believe. It is one of the best games I have ever played and a true work of art."

Kongmuhammad,2023-02-15,100,یکی از دوستام اینو بهم پیشنهاد داده بود گفت سخته من نمیتونم ردش کنم منم کنجکاو شدم و اینطوری شد که با یکی از بهترین تجربه های بازی در پی سی آشنا شدم
aligunes,2023-01-30,80,This game is very tense and mysterious. The graphics are nice. A different experience with short gameplay.
KingStock_,2023-01-10,100,"Amazing. The art style, the scary envoirment.. I was really not expectong to have so much fun. Piece of art"
boltron,2023-01-09,100,"One of the greatest games ever made. It's more like a dense, thick and overwhelming movie than ""just"" a game. And that ending!"
