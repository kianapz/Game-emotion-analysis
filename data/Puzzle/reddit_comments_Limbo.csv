Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"just don't tell them. my buddy died fuck heroin and his brother just wiggled his way into his steam account. i've heard stories of people contacting steam to say their loved one has passed, and steam closed the account. if your loved one dies, blessings and love for your family, but also light identity theft isn't a big deal. dont do heroin."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,did that one reddit post about asking steam support really blow up this much?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"just leave your credentials on some visible piece of paper among your stuff and you're good to go. i mean, steam can't really tell the difference between you and someone else, right...?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,can an llc be owner of the licenses?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"couldn't you like... include all relevant login info in your will? if they are your next of kin, accessing your 2fa shouldn't be hard."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just don't die then? skill issue smh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just a reminder that gog sells drm free games so you can just hand off an external drive to your inheritors.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,bruce willis had beef with apple about this same issue with his itunes music collection long time ago.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'll give the ownership to my children... just ignore the porn game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,i dont think my son or daughter would like to see that their dad played eight hours of mirror and finished the game in one afternoon twenty or so years ago.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,how the fuck are they gonna know i'm dead if someone is still playing my games..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"what?! i think they need to fix this. people are not immortal, so digital game purchases should be transferrable to inheritors."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"laws around digital goods need to be reformed fast, because if not we will soon see that companies have full control over what people buy, as more and more goods are digital. this shit should not be legal."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,not everyone is going to share the same sentiment as me. but i dont really care about any of my stuff after i die.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,if only there was a way to leave my login info to my next of kin
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,is this even a concern if i got family share turned on? guess you could always leave a note
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"as a millennial, my steam account is the most valuable thing i own. this is such an injustice. my grandchildren will never be able to inherit my gamer legacy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,we will own nothing and like it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,we need digital media rights to be protected at a federal level. but our federal representatives barely understand technology...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"whichever child gets my steam account as their inheritance will have a treasure trove of classics.....wait i have porn games, that shit is going with me to the grave."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,how exactly? my steam account is not attached to my legal name whatsoever. payment details doesn't count because there's no rule that would prevent someone from paying for someone else's games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"of course not, because people with a lot of money need more of your money. they want a piece of every pie. those games someone wants to leave in a will are profit on the table. not sure what the deal was here with this whole valve is the good guy theme in this sub, they are a business and dont exist for the benefit of anyone or anything except themselves."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i plan to load my brain into a computer so i can play forevermore
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,ill just give one of my kids or grandkids my password.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i saw that original post and it's all such bullshit. all your accounts are in legal limbo. leave your fucking passwords in your will
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"article 42 of directive 200924 on the legal protection of computer programs must be interpreted as meaning that the right of distribution of a copy of a computer program is exhausted if the copyright holder who has authorised, even free of charge, the downloading of that copy from the internet onto a data carrier has also conferred, in return for payment of a fee intended to enable him to obtain a remuneration corresponding to the economic value of the copy of the work of which he is the proprietor, a right to use that copy for an unlimited period. articles 42 and 51 of directive 200924 on the legal protection of computer programs must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of the resale of a user licence entailing the resale of a copy of a computer program downloaded from the copyright holders website, that licence having originally been granted by that rightholder to the first acquirer for an unlimited period in return for payment of a fee intended to enable the rightholder to obtain a remuneration corresponding to the economic value of that copy of his work, the second acquirer of the licence, as well as any subsequent acquirer of it, will be able to rely on the exhaustion of the distribution right under article 42 of that directive, and hence be regarded as lawful acquirers of a copy of a computer program within the meaning of article 51 of that directive and benefit from the right of reproduction provided for in that provision. source eclieuc2012407 not an expert on eu law by any means but i can see this being applicable in this situation as well. you can sell your videogames, so this must mean they're goods. goods are inheritable. right? probably really iffy reasoning lmao."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"the new family sharing option helps, at least someone could make use of my games. after everyone in the family dies though, though.. womp womp"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,my brother died 6 years ago and i still play games from his massive library.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if i pass on my email and steam id, those fucks have 0 way of figuring out anything. yeah they might not agree with it but its not like they are witch hunting the accounts that are doing it.... its just a shit rule thats not enforced whatsoever at least that we have seen in the news"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"oh look, another reddit post scraped and turned into an article, lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"a part of me is surprised that this has become such an issue. why do people think that others will even want their steam account when they die? look at any charitythrift store, most of the things they are selling are from dead people. the collections of cds, movies, records etc that were passed on and not wanted because they are the dead persons taste, or out of fashion because they are old. how are games any different? who is going to want my steam library of games from when i was alive when im dead? there will be so many game for the recipient by then that really im just passing on a backlog they likely wont touch."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i can't wait to leave my family all my hentai games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not if my son steals my identity
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,how about using login and password of said passed person? whats the problem with that?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"the way i see it, if i had all physical media, then natural wear and tear would mean most, if not all of it wouldnt work by the time i die. if i had my games through something like gog and stored on an external drive, then by the time i die i doubt anyone would have a pc that could run them due to compatibility issues outside of emulation anyway. i do think we need to sort out the bullshit of digital distribution not being treated as ownership, but its not the only issue here."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"remember to sell or gift your account to someone right before you die. that way your account won't be stuck in limbo forever. also, sony and microsoft transfer dead people's accounts to any surviving kids or inheriters to the dead. kinda suprised valve doesn't."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,couldn't you just pass down the account details forever? you can get steam gift cards everywhere and the age verification doesn't matter at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,idk i'm passing my account down to my kids when i have them one day
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,just leave your kid your credentials lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"sooooo, i cant just have like a steam beneficiary? like in the banks?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"should have stuck with gog from the get go. my plan is to build a tower, download everything, set steam to offline mode and take out the network interface card."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if i can never own it, then pirates are just borrowing things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,can my child inherit my steam account if i specified that in my last will?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i mean, judging by some peoples game collections it might be for the best."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,my son has the login in 1pass. whats mine is his.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this questions what it means to own a game. publishers want you to own nothing it's only licensed to you. and i mean, sure. i don't necessarily disagree with your licenses expiring when you die for obvious reasons. it's this thing that publishers are doing where they change the terms of your license after you've bought the license, ubisoft, that needs to be addressed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,seems like much todo about nothing. between family sharing and just plain giving someone your password hell include it in your will is it really the end of the world? like normally i'm all about preservation and futureproofing but i know this stems out of that one guy on reddit making a fuss over emailing steam support.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,good. i like the mystery. i also hope a bot takes over and randomly plays for me in random games. that would freak everyone out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,note to self put steam account info in will
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"leave your steam login with your heirs, they'll have to fight for it though. only the strongest deserves access to my library!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,companies can't die. start a company for holding all your digital content. pass ownership of the company on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,bury them with me like the pharaohs of old
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"ehh, there are worse games to be stuck in than limbo!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it's cool. if i die will someone please finish the total war warhammer 2 campaign. tyrion. my computer bricked and fuck those orcs
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,but steam family library still exists right?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,no they wont.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just wait for the eu to enact laws enforcing the right to pass on digital licenses
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"no they won't, just pass down yor login details to whomever you want, end of story."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"personally, i'm glad all my video games are safely stored behind a 5000 page eula i've never read but agreed to. aren't you? hail corporate!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"steam doesn't even care how old i am, judging by the fact it keeps asking and accepting random dates, so i doubt they're gonna check obituaries. i still have my dad's amazon account running, and he's been gone a couple years. like the man said, write the damn passwords on a piece of paper. boom."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"your steam account is owned by the email. it's not hard. have the email, have the account."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,need to start adding all the logins and passwords to your wills.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"and to my wife, i leave my steam account."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just give your kid the password and dont say anything to steam.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-26,1 create game called legal limbo 2 i slowly accumulate all the steam games in the world. 3 will forever have the highest achievement score.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,and i wont care because im dead
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,those of you saying to pass down login info forgot about steam guard
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"just leave all digital assets, purchases, licenses to next of kin in your will and include login access. not rocket science"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,so? i'm the only one in my family that played them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,they should find a way to put up the libraries for donations.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,maybe your steam games will be...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,your steam account will self destruct in tminus 69 years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"even if your account is 150 years old, it's none of their business. just leave your credentials with a friend or something, say feel free to share these games with kids"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just store the email info linked to steam account
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,will it to a trust to be held in perpetuity.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,what will become of my sims??
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"easy solution, don't die. cyber steam 2077"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i would like to believe that new games come out at a fast enough rate that this is a non issue. unless, of course, steam starts penny pinching."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,says you. my ghost is planning to possess my computer and we're paying for eternity.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,couldn't you just use the account access to share the library through family sharing?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,question i have is what about the family sharing option when someone passes?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you can probably put it in a will
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if steam libraries were passable on by will i think it would both do some good and get some good press and goodwill in the long term. just a thought
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"after i die? i'm already 124 years old, pretty sure at this rate i'm immortal on steam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,... public domained games are gonna be a thing just like cinema is becoming now
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,pass it onto your children never hide the password from them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not if i give the password to someone.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"by the time i die, i don't think my grown up children will want to play with my decades old games that they never heard about. i don't even think i'll be thinking about steam in my 60s70s. and if i die suddenly, my children will be either to young to play the games i am playing or they're old enough that i'm already sharing my account with them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i wonder if i can transfer my account to my son through my will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,for everyone saying why do people care it's because of the bullshit the world was slept walked into with digital rights you don't own shit and it can be taken from you.. games can be delisted and removed movies and tv shows taken even if you used the buy now option and things like steam can't be transferred people are starting to care about that and the laws need to be reformed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"not really... leave account credentials in the will, if you have multiple gamers usecreate a family share with the deceased and you can inherit the library amongst the family. if you have a scumbag family member willing to report the account over this or that... well they were going to screw you over the distribution of assets in the will anyways. you don't need to use the account, and if steam steps in and bans the account anyways just sue them for violating the terms of the estate. if the decedent is smart, they will specifically list the people or steam accounts by name who will legally be allowed to game share their library. you can get real specific and use that numbered unique identifier everyone gets with their account so valve cannot dispute who has access to that library, and they cannot argue with the court when the proper systems they provide are used to extend the decedents library amongst the survivorship of the estate. ps i'm not a lawyer, but considering how many frivolous lawsuits we have had in the united states over the years, just claiming sharing the account is against the tos won't hold up if creating this family share is the final action the account takes and people don't actually use the account to play that specific library. i doubt valve will get involved with disputing every claim against each and every estate on earth so long as people don't use that account to actively play games!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"no they won't. i have my current credentials, i.e, the key to my password database, with a trusted source. it's a friend of 20 years, and i trust them to handle that shit, if i should ever snuff it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"honestly, you should have a contingency plan to transition the credentials which access all of your important assets. just be sure to include steam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,at least one steam user has already been rendered dead over the course of steam's years of existence.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"um no, my best friend has my info and i've already expressly said he can have it to do what he wishes if i die early. it will be placed in my will. if i have kids the account would go to them and they'd have to share but faily share would always work beucase i'd neve be online, lmao."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i plan on leaving a treasure map to my steam credentials, one day leading a band of misfit children on a coming of age adventure to save their home in a race against time"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,personally i'd want to write into my will that my closest group of friends can use my account after i die and turn it into a shared one. at least i'm hoping they steam would allow that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,so hard to just leave them the login info?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i gave my son my steam creds, and i have his."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,that's why you name your kid after your own name!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,time to update my will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,fuckin' hell i wanted to play cs2 in heaven.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i would actually be fine with my game purchases being licenses for life. but i would want it to be clear. and i would want it to work both directions. if the digital goods i buy are licenses, and not personal goods to be owned in perpetuity, there has to be at least some minimum level of support the publisher is required to provide. if a game is delisted, i need to retain ownership. if it's being removed or canceled entirely, i need copies of the game files, drm free. wtf is drm even for once a publisher has determined they're not going to profit any further? and i need these assurances to come from the government, with an actual enforcement mechanism behind them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"family share? and yeah password share too, no one's going to keep track of that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"and to timmy, my favorite nephew, i leave you the login credentials to my steam account and the vast library of games stored i've collected through the years."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,no if it is in a family group
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"as others have stated, nah just leave your whoever your login and password. and those pesky security questions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,my grandchildren will be playing with all of my sims dlc whether they like it or not
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,engrave on my gravestone all the games on my library i've bought but never played
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,steam knows i was born on jan 1 1900 i am immortal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not if you justshare your password
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i am immortal steam.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"my friend died of covid back in early 2020. he logged me in as a family share member in 2012. he has hundreds of games i have never played before, and i tried playing through them as some form of catharsis, but the list was too long to finish. i log into steam and see hundreds of games i never purchased and see how many hours my friend played of those games. i get sad thinking about all the games he put time in, and i don't want to lose his account because it is the last thing i have left of him. i hope i never lose his family account because i have no way of getting it back. i remember arguing over video games and animes. it was some of the most fun conversations i have ever had. rip, buddy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i think steam has to legally say you can't transfer ownership,but i bet if it came down to it they wouldn't care if you died and gifted your account to someone."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'm not even dead and they won't let me reset my password. keep demanding a cd key from 30 years ago. fuckin jerks. gonna make me fly 3k miles and go to their hq in person.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"my son and i will share the same steam account. hes only one right now, but theres no reason for him to start his own account separate from mine"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"just fucking lieeeeee and never tell steam. worst case, they were gonna be gone anyway?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,they won't be stuck. i have a book with all my accounts in my safe. my final instructions include the combo and some words of wisdom.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i give full permission to anyone that finds my password when i die to have complete custody over my steam account. i'm gonna make it a whole treasure hunt starting with just a note.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,can steam just add a beneficiary page?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yeah, me too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i think most of us will live longer than steam. in which case the problem will be the reverse, everyone, everywhere loses all the accounts, games, saves, and dlc at the same time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,that's a risk i'm willing to take. every first sentence of my will is going to be an individual character for my username and password. you know what to do.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you'll never be in limbo if they don't know you're dead
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'm not personally worried. but i know that things like train simulator have tons of optional dlc skinsmodelsetc. could be talking 1000s worth of merch. that should go to an heir. who won't use it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this is why all digital content is the devil! physical media is your only friend. physical media is the only one that cares. when home consoles no longer get physical releases, that's when i stop playing all new games and start working my way back to the classics. their are enough games from just the 90s to keep you busy for the rest of your life!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,putting my steam account in a trust. that way it only ever has 1 owner and there are no tos violations
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,another w for physical media
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if i'm about to die i'll probably just give my account to a family or a friend . whatever they do with it after that is no longer my business anyways .
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,people will need to start leaving online account info in their wills
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i like steam, but we 100 need legislation that either forces digital goods to be actually owned, or forces digital storefronts to clearly state that youre not buying a product, youre leasing it. i suspect people would be more hesitant if the steam page had a big lease button instead of a buy button"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i mean i'm already like 123 years old ...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"so if i backup all my games on steam with pirated copies, is it stealing?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,so 30k down the drain.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,how cares about your steam account after you die. games aren't what's on my mind when leaving stuff to people
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,fuck. i'll die with pajama sam thunder and lightning aren't so frightening as my most played game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,is it not auto included in the inheritance?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just have someone inherit the account when you create your will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,mine is going to my kid who is a 24 year old adult now
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i never even considered this...but i doubt my kids would even want it...they have their own accounts and libraries and i am sure their kids will also have their own. yah it would be nice to do but honestly i probably won't even give it a thought. maybe now that it is in the light they will consider changing their policy in the future.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i doubt steam will last 50 years. however same can be said about anythinganyone
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"good luck with that. my steam account is the first asset i consider for that sort of thing, and i know where its going. prove that single ip change isnt me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"the steam games are going in the will, don't worry."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,could you pass it down in your will? lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not really. theyll remain tied to your steam account with no way to transfer them to a different account but you can give your whole account to someone. itll be inconvenient since they would have to switch between your account and theirs depending on whose library they are playing from but theyll still have your games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this haunts me, my online digital purchases can not be inherited. which opens the question, is being a digital version of a pharaoh that has digital treasures even possible?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,leaving my son a backlog of games in my will he has to complete them all to fulfill my dying wishes
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,ill add my steam account to my will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"no. i intend to give my login credentials to one of my children. they will inherit thousands of games that i haven't touched and they probably won't either, but it will be theirs"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"write down the login id and password somewhere, keep it with your stuff and leave a note to never never let steam find out about your death."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,soon we are gonna get you legally only own access to this game for 10 year in all the fine print
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"they cannot prove i'm dead, my son will be mr smith after i'm dead and account says that. my name isn't smith but you get the point"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"skyrim already runs itself, maybe i'd get actual good loot this run?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not if people know your login

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"my brother has my account info for steam and gog. if he outlives me he'll give it to my nephew, though i'm not sure how much good that will do since the only games i have that he ever had an interest in he stopped playing years ago skyrim, fallout 3, fallout 4, the stronghold series, age of empires, and baldur's gate 1 and 2 and his eyes glaze over every time i try to tell him about any of the other games in my library kenshi, rimworld, factorio, space engineers, medieval engineers, medieval dynasty, prison architect, etc.. my ea account will die with me. that account has become the pink bedroom filled with barbies and stuffed unicorns that my parents would never let me have, and the sims 4 is the barbie dream house i knew better than to ask my parents for."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,imagine how huge and valuable a steam collection might be when it's been passed on for many generations.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"when it comes to legal ownership of that account, though, the steam subscriber agreement seems relatively clear. i always find it amusing that people quote the tos or user agreement as a legal basis as if it's the constitution. if there are relevant applicable laws they will always override whatever bs the online service wrote down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,are people really so isolated now that they can't figure out how to hand over their stuff to someone else? loneliness epidemic indeed....

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"knowing how valve operates, we might eventually get steam library inheritance. you split your game library upon family memberschildren."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,media going digital was great but now legally it is more renting than owning. especially with content that requires online connection we have seen games been turned off since companies like ubisoft do not want to pay the pennies for people to keep using it. if steam decided they no longer wanted to support a game you could be shit out of luck even before you die
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,jokes on them. i told my buddy where i wrote down and hid my steam password and told him to go get it if i die.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"does the eula support giving away your account to someone else? if yes, that would erase this issue."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if you can inherit debt, why not a steam account?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,so you should always buy physical ? interesting point
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i wrote my steam games into my will. they go to my nephew. if steam wants to go into a legal battle with a 12 year old if i beat the dust the next 10 years or so. they are welcome to try. he gets a fit if he doesn't get what he wants.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,yo just pass it down with pen and paper. is it that fucking difficult?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,are we really still on this? just write your damn login credentials on a piece of paper. you should've anticipated this when you bought digital games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"imagine not just writing your steam account details in your will and saying i bequeath my unusuals and csgo weapon skins to my wife. its not legal limbo, its hmm yes, i will my steam library to someone but i wont actually give them my login. as all one has to do to have total control over a steam account is sign in, steam support has to take the stance of if he wanted you to have access, hed give you his login details. now if it was brought to their attention that the owner had passed away and his heir was using the account, and they did nothing, yeah, its cool."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"just write down your passwords, it's not that hard."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i have 2 cloud accounts with a keepass file with all my accounts which go into the hundreds of various game, banking, and general sites i have. my wife has the passwords to both my cloud accounts and the keepass file. i also have an external ssd with the same keepass file. i also have a single usb thumb drive with that keepass file. so if anything happens to her or me we have access to each other's accounts. i keep the keepass file updated often. i am also one of those people who keeps multiple backups of everything. all information she might need to disable my 2fa on accounts is also saved in that keepass file. i have twin 8yearold boys who are now pc gamers so if i die for whatever reason i know they both will have my accounts and i am cool with that. i like to plan ahead like this. shit happens and i could drop dead or be killed just walking out to get my mail. i can't imagine the headache she and my kids would have to go through to get into some of those accounts i have and i don't want that so i made it as easy as i could for them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,which is why my son has full access to my steam account. he's probably the only 16 year old with a 15 year old steam account.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this is absolutely crazy of an article. however, having done a deep dive myself personally on what happens to our digital lives when we die i found a few interesting things. youll have to excuse me if this is worded a little weird im using voice to text on my phone phone. my hands cramping today. most companies still do not account for the death of their users and do not have policies for the terms of service their publicly posted with their online content. different companies who do have policies in place are all different. for instance, to get somebodys google account or microsoft account you need to talk to an escalated google representative or microsoft representative and arranged to send a copy of the death certificate of the account owner to them before they will release name and password , and two factor credentials. in the case of samsung, i believe they also do the same thing. however, on the flipside of that apple, when you notify them of a users death, they put the account in question in their release or whatever it is to basically be deleted within six months to a year. even if you show them a copy of a death certificate for the account holder, they will not release the account to you and that is a single year of security that i am very pleased apple has. in the case of games, game content and things like steam, you would have to contact their customer service and find out what their individual afterlife policies are in obtaining accounts. im sure as more and more of the digital users online age, this will become more commonly addressed across the board as members of certain sites and certain platforms die off. as a reminder to people, it is always a good idea to keep an updated list of passwords and accounts written down somewhere with a living, or power of attorney. this way, if there is information in any of these accounts that your family may need to finalize certain aspects of your affairs they will have access to them. personally, i have every single major digital account that allows it accounted for in my will. and i also have a deadman switch email that if i do not use it within a certain amount of time it will contact certain people with instructions on how to get into other accounts. i hope this is enough information for people to be able to understand that digital content, games, emails, and accounts are still a very young legal field when it comes to the dying in the deceased."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'm selling mine when i know im dying. i have an original dbd account and tf2 account with lets say... stuff on them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"we are currently in the era that will shape this issue and it shakes out one of two ways 1. we, are a population and society, create ballot measures, or pressure our elected officials, to change the law to allow for true ownership of digital goods and i swear to christ, if someone mentions nfts, i will find you and forcefeed you a gpu. this would entail forcing companies providing a version of any piece of media we purchase that is usable and storable offline, which is fairly straightforward for video, music, books, et cetera, and for most games, but provides a challenge for games that are primarily played online mmos, mobas, and the like. this gets more tangled when you consider what version of a living, evolving, game a purchaser might own and be required to have access to. it wouldnt be an easy issue to solve and wed likely have to go several rounds to properly refine the laws around this as new issues and edge cases arise. in this case, something like a steam library becomes an inheritable good like a bank account whose contents can go to one person or split among multiple. 2. we stay the current course and companies dont sell us a copy of their work that we have perpetual access to, but a license to use it until a nebulous time in the future that they choose, at which point they can revoke it. this is the we do nothing option or maybe, more grimly, we try and fail because we live in a society dominated by corporate wellbeing over human life and happiness. in this case, the best we can hope for is valve turning the steam accounts of the deceased into memorial accounts a la facebook the worst case is they just wipe the existence of that account after death."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"steam is going the us military's don't ask, don't tell approach of account inheritance. i personally only think steam don't allow account ownership transfers because they're conforming to what the rest of the industry is doing games becoming less and less owned but rather leased out to people who buy a license. for now, the issue is moot since it's so easily circumvented. i do suspect that once steam's age starts approaching the limits of natural human lifespan, that some antiinheritance safe checks will be put in place with some pressure from the game industry. such as linking a name and dob to the account on creation and requiring a scan of official id or documents every couple of years. i would hate for any of that to happen, but i don't suspect steam wants to play the good guy on this issue like they do on others, putting their foot down on game ownership could easily backfire on their agreements with big game developers and have them jump ship to other platforms, or their own."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"to clarify, this is just stupidity. yes, steam legally cant give digital products to others in wills. that is primarily because digital media laws have not caught up to the technology yet. however, there is nothing legally preventing you from putting in your estate your login credentials to your steam account. youd just leave your password and username to your lawyer and state who gets it. upon passing, your lawyer would give them a document or flash drive with said information. confidential information in wills is passed this way."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"buying games nowadays is buying a licence to access a game which is instead hosted on the company's servers. the clientside version of the game is just an access portal to the actual game code running on another machine. the game server requires money to remain in operation due to the cost of electricity, storage, data bandwidth and maintenance. once a game ceases to be profitable, it is shut down. this cycle happens every ten to fifteen years at best. as a result, you will outlive most of your games anyway. don't believe me? i'd be happy to settle the matter over a game of overwatch 1 or dawngate. but for the few games which are old or kind enough to run on local hardware.... civilised nations have a legally protected right to transfer these licences. for instance, the european union has a legal protection for the transfer of software licences. so you'd just give someone your steam password and username as part of your last will and testament, unless you live in a less civilised country where such things are illegal."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,people need to realize its probably going to come down to server costs. have games backed up on up to date drives when you die and try to show the importance of those drives as history for future family members. if someone tries to reactivate and download a terabyte worth of games 20 years after they ever got a dollar from you the same week as a bunch of other people its going to end in restrictions.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"my wife is a solicitor what we call lawyers in scotland and she actually looked in to this many years ago as a recent graduate. if i remember correctly it's often called your digital legacy. facebook, at least at the time, had a facility to nominate someone to manage your profile after death. by manage i'm fairly sure it meant download all your photos to preserve then update to say you've passed or something like that. this was like 10 years ago or so she looked in to it. i'd be surprised if many more companies, including steam, didn't have a policy to handle deceased users by now. it's almost certainly in the terms of service. could very well say that you only lease games for your lifetime.and can't transfer. however, there are enough niche scenarios with parentchild shared accounts that i'd be extremely surprised if there wasn't an allowance to transfer things. looking beyond just the actual games, a child may be more interested in saving the save filesawards. they can't be bought back."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,after i die i'm pretty sure i won't give a fuck about my steam games. people with kids or something liket hat can just leave the password for them to use. so what's the issue?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,why do people care about this so much. if somebody you know dies are your first instincts actually to go play all their games?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"a lot of people are missing the point here. the issue is that you can't transfer your legally owned digital games via a will when you pass like you can physically owned things. if that's the case, do you truly own the digital games you bought? if it's not transferable, then i'd argue no you don't. i mean to me it was already obvious. in my view, you aren't buying games on steam, you're buying a license to play the game via steam. you bought a license, not the code. i can give my physical copy of ff7 for the ps1 to my sister, friend, etc. when i do that, they own it now. they could do the same for someone else. if square enix goes under, i can still play it via a ps1, ps2, ps3, or hardware that can emulate it. i still have access to the physical copy i bought. i can make a backup of the disc which i have so that even when my copy succumbs to time, i still have it. i'm legally allowed to do so by law and nothing sony, square enix, or any other company involved with the development, marketing, past release, or current releases of ff7 can do about that. not unless the law was rewritten. with digital games, you have none of that. you can't give or lend it to someone. yes you can family share, but if steam ever closed up shop, you'd lose access because you can't connect to steams servers to download it would also kill family share as well. many games on steam use steam itself as drm, so even if you had it downloaded, you'd have to find a way to bypass steam to launch the game as many game executables require steam to launch to launch the game. along with that, while copyright law does allow someone to make archival copies of physical media, digitally downloaded media does not get the same treatment. so unfortunately, none of us own any of the games on our steam library. we purchased a license which gives us access to run the code, but we don't own the code itself."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,video game ownership should be a nft and there should be a free markets to trade or sell them. just like the old days with disks and cartridges.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this doesn't sound like my problem honestly.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,no one wants your massive collection of 5 indie games when you die.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i mean..... i don't care lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,fine i plan to die once and not comeback.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"all of this boils down to the fact that you do not own digital goods. you own a license to use them, and through that technicality they can mandate that license be nontransferable and limited to you. theyre trying desperately to bring this idea to tangible goods too by making everything subscription based and locking functionality behind it and using the same licenseagreement bullshit to remove property ownership rights."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"idgaf, mummify me with my shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,who cares. windows will be gone by then
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"okay? if i'm dead, what do i care what happens to those games? it's not like i'm gonna will my login credentials to my family lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,good. i don't need my kids finding my hidden game collection
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,did not read the link it be fair why would i care? i will be dead. p
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i scrolled a lot and havent seen a single person mentioned that they arent your games. you have access to them through the license you purchased. you have no right to the game itself just the license to play it. inb4 dudes full of shit, i went through the steam partnership process and have the ability to put games on steam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,sounds like not my problem
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"you can't give what you don't own, that's why you can't include digital anything in your will we don't buy that stuff, we enter into a contract that gives us the rightlicense to use a copy, that's it. i'm guessing it's the same if you rent a carhouseapartment, you can't include the lease in your will, once you die the contract becomes null."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"who cares about steam games, when you're no longer able to play?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this headline sounds like a burn i'd hear from someone i killed in an online game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i don't give a fuck, i'm dead."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,is a lifetime licence to play the game not enough? gamers are really weird nowadays...

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,who is going to want a hunch of probably 40 year old steam games?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,well i won't care. i'll be dead
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,isn't this the same with all digital content? aren't physical goods in physical limbo? obviously someone could just pick it up and take it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,im dead. who cares
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,why would this matter to anyone?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if i can't give my games away i don't own my games, therefore ..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,boy i love when the same nothingburger of a story makes the rounds repeatedly over the course of 2 weeks while adding absolutely nothing to the story.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i can live with this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,oh no. anyway.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"those are just bought licenses anyway, doesn't matter. i don't really own any of my steam games, it's just a longterm loan."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i think it's so funny people are just starting to realize that if you don't have a physical copy of something...you don't own it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,why is this even an issue? almost every game you currently own will be on a sale for pennies in the future. it's not priceless china.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,after i diei wont care
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,hahahahahaha
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i'll be dead, i don't think it will matter much to me given i don't have kids to pass it on to."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i want my steam library to be buried with me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,how tf do licensing agreements still shock and confuse people in 2024
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,oh no. ill be dead who cares
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if i die i really dont care
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"you did not buy a game. you purchased a license to play a game. upon death, those licenses become invalid also, steam can terminate your account."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,womp womp womp.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i guess you can't take it with you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i dont rlly think ill care about what happens to my steam acct after i die
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-26,i'll be dead. why the fuck would i care about what happens to my game catalogue? i'm dead.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"why does this matter, who cares about a steam library after they die? its a account with licenses to own digital games, not actual ownership of those games, so under their licenses you probably cant transfer the ownership of the account with a licenses to a new person since the license is probably for you buying it. a bank account, property i can get since that actually matters if you pass stuff down. even furniture helps more than a steam library."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'll be dead... i won't care.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i regret moving to steam and being a pc gamer as ridiculous as it sounds. i never knew how important physical media was until now. atleast on consoles, even with their issues, you can put in a cart or disc from 20 years ago and play the campaign or local coop."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,digital content you never owned any of it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you should see what happens to your physical stuff when you die. not everyone shares your hobbies or interests. a lot of stuff gets donated or trashed or sold way cheap.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this is a problem nft gaming can solve, so that you can actually own your digital assets."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"it's been like this for over a decade dude. the agreement has always been this and everyone agreed to it when they made an account. if your going to bitch and moan go over to gog. like, i don't know what you expected."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i'll be dead, i won't care."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you don't actually own any of the games on steam anyway
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,who actually cares
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,leave it to a pc neckbeard to value his steam collection as if it was inheritance. nobody else wants your anime titbobbing bullshit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,can't play games when you're dead.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,im not particularly concerned with what happens to my games after i die
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,let's be honest. no one wants my old ass games when i die. they'll be like grandma's china set except digital.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"who cares, you are dead"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"most fucking bullshit lazy made up stupid journalism ever. one of my pals died in covid three years ago, nowdays his nephew using his account. end of story."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it's not like it will be my problem
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"omg when i die i cant gift my computer games to my heirs i hate the world, so unfair this must be insert your most hated group heres fault fuck those kids dying of cancer and everybody else dying from insert random war here but my computer games though"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,and now on the list of things i could care less about...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"why do people think people will care about there old games, it like your grandad pulling out his old commodore 64, 5 minutes of interest then forgotten about."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this subreddit never gets sick of this dumb shit post, month after month, year after year. same shit as always. no fucking shit you can't play your steam games that you just license through steam that rely on external servers. everyone has known this for like...decades? same shit is true on every console. you can back up steam games fairly trivially if you are that paranoid, assuming they don't rely on external connections."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,and? why does anyone care about this at all? youre not gonna have those games in the afterlife
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,we dont know each other but wishing you the best and may your days shine bright
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,yep pretty much. my cousin unexpectedly passed a few months ago and his nephew is now using his account cause they got his pc. it actually kinda hurts seeing his account go online but i'm sure my cousin is glad someone is using it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,identity theft is not a joke jim! millions of families suffer every year!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,reminds of doug stanhope's very dark bit if there were no afterlife... how could my mother have bought me and my friends so many nice things from the skymall catalog... on her credit card... four days after she passed from this earth?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,dont do drugs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you can grant digital assets and accounts to people in a will. whether a company recognizes those rights is kinda up to them in a lot of situations. but...still...you can put it in a will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i actually wonder what the legalities of this kind of light identity theft would be. when it comes to identity theft cases it's usually the person whose identity is stolen who sues. of course any party who has a damage would be theoretically able to sue but i am wondering whether a court would actually find any damages on valves side. another problem with such a case of stolen identity is that identity theft requires that you use someone else's identity without his permission. of course a permission is not explicitly given here but if it's part of someones will that you receive the steam account which is bound to his identity, one could argue that this is an implicit permission to use the identity for this specific purpose."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"well... gaming and many tech journalists browse reddit for 99 of their content, so one of them found that and saw a good opportunity."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"it wasn't even the first time someone has asked that exact question, hell it wasn't even the first time steam's response to that question has gone viral. they've held this stance since i was in middle school and i'm 30 now and i only know because when i was 11 or 12 was the first time i remember steam telling someone that and it being posted on a forum and gaining traction."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"nah, and it's not this questions first rodeo either. that said, it is an interesting legal question. back when my dad died, i had to process  shut down all his accounts. i'm pretty sure most companies don't really give a shit, at least as long as any bills are paid. and then there's some companies, which apparently don't have a process to early cancel a subscriptionan account for reasons of dude my dad fucking died, this cannot possibly be the first of your customers that died, how the fuck do you not have a process for this"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it doesn't have to blow up for it to hit your news feed. news outlets use ai and to generate low effort news stories. people are fed news that they will click. so all a news outlet has to do is harvest the top n threads from the most popular subs to generate lots of hits.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"this kind of issue isn't new, and has been periodically popping up in the news since the mid2000s. media loves to exploit outrage, like they did when they claimed bruce willis was suing itunes.httpswww.theguardian.comtechnologyblog2012sep03noapplebrucewillis people just have a lot of anxiety about the legacy they leave."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,link?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this might be your first rodeo of a reddit post turning into a big story for mainstream media because they have nothing better to report on. happens too much. no biggie.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"it's dumb, too, because of course steam isn't going to bother to give you a legal framework to pass on your games. they'd need to get lawyers that handled how wills work, they'd have to comply with laws in 100 different places, they'd have to hire support people to evaluate death certificates, they'd get people committing fraud to try to steal accounts through this mechanism. they'd have to go back on dozens or hundreds of agreements with publishers and put in some sort of account transferrability clause. or............. steam can just leave it alone and you can pass down your account info and not make a big show of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"look at the current story about microsoft trying to buy valve. that's all bullshit created by someone, based solely on a leaked email from i thin 2020 and never progressed from should we buy valve or nintendo?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,yes. and nobody answered the question what happens to steam when the big g is gone?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i've had this question since i was 15.. and that's over 10 years ago at this point with my friends about hey what do we do with our steam accounts when we die. theres a shitload of money invested in them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,what reddit post?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"all of these websites use bots to find successful reddit posts and then llms to write regurgitated articles like this, it's common practice now. we add arstechnica to the list."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not eve the first time this has happened. someone asked about it like 3 years ago and it blew up. but everyone forgot and here we are again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-26,reddit is mainstream now
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-27,so it is real or not?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,reposts for a year easy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i'm a little surprised. i was already a little surprised in the first place by that post because i thought, ...yeah, of course you can't transfer your games to another account. i mean, how many online services offer that? the wii, wii u, switch, the entire psn from ps3 to ps5, none of them let you do that. why would it be so shocking and surprising that you can't transfer your games to another account? and why is that such a big deal? this whole thing baffles me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,a quote from a low level support agent who might not even fully understand the tos themselves no less
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,my brother did this with my dads steam credentials. i wasnt aware of this beforehand however and got the fright of my life when the steam notification popped up that my dead dad was now online
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"hmmm, this account has been active for 150 years...it's probably nothing edit itt people who don't understand what active means."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"heres my steam account, also delete my browser history"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,there was a case where a guy was deciding between 2 people to leave his gaming account in his will. the one who lost reported the account and got it banned.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"me and my brother, who have not lived in the same state for over 10 years, were sharing a single steam account for that entire time. i once outright basically admitted this to steam not being aware it was against their tos, and they basically just said we're gonna choose to ignore that. never once was an issue outside of us being unable to play games at the same time, and even that could be circumvented by one of us going offline. nowadays we just use steam family sharing and it's been working perfectly"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i leave all that i own to my cat, guppy.."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,put the details in your will to a specific person rather than on a random desk note.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,thats true but we should still have an official mechanism instead of doing something valve and other companies can site as a breach of terms if they find out about it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,i took over my dad's account when he passed away.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if buying isn't owning... or even a fucking permanent license...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i plan on doing this with my daughter. my account is over a decade old at this point and i plan to game until i die. its already over 6k in retail games. probably 4k if you get it all on sale. ill be dead no worries for me what she does with it. i do plan on letting her know potential buyers in about 30 years just in case she doesnt end up wanting it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i feel like people are making this bigger than it is. steam is just saying they won't transfer an account from someone once they are deceased. how would steam go through a process of confirming someone's death and confirming the new person is someone they wanted the account transferred to. it would just be a headache for them to deal with. in the meantime, just writing down credentials and changing account details to a new person works. once steam has accounts over 100 years old, they might make some rule to delete those accounts if they aren't used for a certain period a time. but if an account is still being used, it will be in steams' interest to keep it so more games are bought."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,post it note under the keyboard is the most secure way obvs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,the only thing i'm wondering is how to do it with someone who has steam guard active.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,with the new family sharing you don't need to ever access the main person's account
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"sure you could do that, but that's an imperfect solution. it introduces uncertainty to something that otherwise should belong to the family. it's no small sums either. there are plenty of steam accounts that are worth easily over 10k."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this is why i have been advocating that digital assets should be traded and sold like any other gaming medium.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,gotta include your email account then as well and remove any two factor authorization before you die so to be clear. if you want to give your steam account away when you die you have to give that person access to the email account associated with it and hope you dont die suddenly before you give both those accounts away fuck even steam for trying to tell me what to do with what i bought. steam is great but they aren't flawless and should be called out for shit like this the fact that we cant sell digital copies of games we paid for should be illegal
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i have all my accounts written down in a destiny 2 journal, and i told my brother that if i die, keep this and use all my stuff."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i mean i must be over 130 years old at this point according to steam so who knows where they draw the line.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"maybe, the whole, to verify ur account, we sent a code to ur email that's it, so write down everything i guess"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you can even change your name and credit card. not that i have experience doing that with a recently deceased relative or anything...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,that's what i did. hopefully the person who inherits my steam account can get a nice price. hopefully the badges add to the value.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,just don't play competitive games like dota 2 and cs2 so many people get banned because of my brother accidentally played on my account
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"give it a decade, vr headsets with retinal linked rm coming and i am not looking forward to wearing contact lenses to counter that shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"hmmm write me up in your will , although i do have stream account with only two games csgo  skyrim"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"not yet but soon governments will be issuing digital ids and companies will want them to confirm that you are who you say you are. it will be touted as a security measure. and i agree it that is a use case, but it will definitely be primarily for tracking you online, and ensuring you play by the rules that make companies the most money"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"correct, we still use my late husband's library over 6 years later."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,until they implement retinal scan through steam vr.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you also need access to their steamguard if they have one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"according to the article, the steam tos say you can't give your password and username to anyone else without valve's permission. they can't exactly crack down on you for that if you're dead, but if you made a big deal publicly about planning to do it, there might be something they could do in response. dunno though."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"ianal, but an llc is technically an artificial person, and for all purposes of all the law for civil cases can be treated as such. it has a name, a date of birth, and somewhere in the future an expiration date, and has parents! as for whether an llc can own licenses, yes but it depends. for instance, it is encouraged you have your llc buy commercial software licenses for things like photoshop, because it is a company expense and can be paid before taxes. however, note that you do need a commercial license for an llc to own it, not just a personal license. that is how photoshop is. but a program like logic pro they only have one license and it serves both personal and commercial purposes. whether you buy it as a person or an llc depends only how you wish to sort your taxes out. this depends entirely on the product and in the fine text of their terms and conditions, so it varies on a case to case basis."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"that's what i would suggest. write down your passwords, tell your next of kin where you wrote it down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,would that be a tos violation?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"you could, but steam can just deactivate the account if they find out for violating their terms and conditions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,all of my authentication stuff is in a password manager. the unlock password is in a safety deposit box. done.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,exactly. its always been this way for anything digital and tied to a personal account.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"you can, but if steam finds out theyll terminate your account as it unfortunately breaches tos"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"principally. it also depends on their tc, which they can change anytime. like how they wont let people into an iphone of someone who died, because somewhere in legalese it says the deceased person is the only true owner of the digital info."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"well, yes. but please don't. wills are public. leave knowledge of it to your trustee in a safe."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i think the issue lies with steam not allowing account transfers
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"well yeah, but the games are still tied to the account, and steam apparently won't accept anyone else as the owner, if there's problems accessing the account. imo this kind of digital nonownership is so dumb. there should be a way to move all of the games maybe in the form of activation codes, so there's no overlap, inventory and wallet to another account belonging to someone named in the will."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yeah. just don't expect steam to give anyone without your usual sign in authority access and you should be fine. i can understand why this is the case. allowing accounts to be transferred to people in a way that bypasses usual security measures would open them up to a lot of account stealing issues. accounts needing to be transferred after a sudden death when access wasn't given is a comparatively rare issue. and besides, who's to say the person who died even wanted their account to be transferred? maybe they played a lot of hentai games they don't want anyone to know about."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,wills are public documents so don't actually put passwords in there.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"the obvious answer is that licenses are not transferable to other accounts. i don't understand why people think this is an issue. you want to pass on account credentials from one person to another whatever, who cares. you want to transfer licenses from x account to y account, that's a no."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"everyone should always have an envelope somewhere labeled 'in case i die' or whatever that has relevant information for your next of kin. all the bills you pay, log in information, account information, wishes, know assetsdebts, etc... it's extremely helpful. but you have to keep it up to date."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,they could delete any account over 100 years old. they could delete any account with the holder reporting that they are over 120 years old. they could delete any account with the owner reported as deceases. i set my birthday as 111900 as soon as they started age restricting content because i felt it was a violation of privacy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"im just saying that if my dad left me his games, the only ones i might play would sim city classic and mist. and id probably have to buy a disk reader or floppy disk reader just to play them. i can only imagine what the world of gaming is going to look like when i pass on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"a lot of password managers nowadays have emergency access that you can set up for a loved one to gain access to your credentials in the event of an emergency or death. they can request access, and after a certain amount of time get access."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i already told steam my birthday was january 1, 1908. obviously im some sort of lich already."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,skull  issue
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"100. i had a near death experience a few years ago. while i was dying, i wrote steam support asking how i could transfer my account to my next of kin after my death. some doctors wouldn't think i'd make another month. i got the same answer that everyone else did. i can't describe what that felt like. the thought of passing my games on was one of the few comforts i had in a very unpleasant time. to have it ripped away from you in an instant by some grunt behind a keyboard is indescribable after i recovered, i switched to gog as much as possible. i took a hard drive and locked it in a safe with my entire collection. my next of kin will receive those, regardless of if they want them or not any disillusionment i had of good guy valve was shattered in that instant. they're not your friend. they're a greedy corporation that will steal from a dying man because, maybe, just maybe, they'll make 50 cents selling portal 2 to his kids 20 years from now. that's all that matters to them. not you, not me, not ownership. money. nothing else. i may not technically own my gog games either, but i can pass them on if my next of kin wants them. that's far more than can be said for steam"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,what was the outcome?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,your friends think the same thing when the notification pops up that youre playing it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,can't even get kids these days to like what you played 10 years ago. they'll call it ancient.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i mean if someone is still playing on a 100 year old account they probably know it's not you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,who would want it though? who the hell is going man this game looks great but gotta wait for gramps to croak so i inherit it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"its lifetime rental, this is the price for the convenience of steam. its so weird that people are making a big deal out of this now as if it came as a huge surprise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"i'm sure there's a fix, but i've read that they do this due to the half dozen or so of legal loopholes involved with fake deaths and account transfer issues with payment methods. long story short, to avoid fraud. as long as someone has the login info and is able to legally accesschange payment info, there's not much else to say about it. someone still owns the account and has access to whatever is on it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,just give the sign in credentials to someone in your will or trust. easy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,you're not purchasing the games. you're leasing the right to install and run them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"they would just argue you don't own the game, it's a life time license"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you dont own any of your digital purchases. which is why piracy is growing again for the first time in years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"that's the issue. you never purchase the game. you only ever purchase the license to play the game. and death revokes that license. always has been like that, even before in times of floppy disks and cds. the difference was, once you had the data on a physical medium, they couldn't really revoke the license."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,games you buy on gog.com are yours forever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-26,"the modern class of lawyer is someone who learned the law in order to subvert it in every possible way. i'm not suggesting that a bunch of people band together and randomly target law firms to remind lawyers that extra judicial practices can be more powerful than judicial practices. i'm not suggesting that. i'm not suggesting that you can easily buy a rubber mask, jumpsuit, new pair of sneakers, and a box nitrile gloves that could help disguise your identity. that's just silly, there are cameras everywhere."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-26,"depends, take into account you're not purchasing anything on steam. you're licensing it for an undisclosed amount of time. steam, at any time they want, can just cancel your account and you lose access to everything you bought. steam is basically netflix but instead of paying every month to have full access, you pay per each game which actually makes it sound almost identical to what stadia was."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i feel like steam of all companies should side with the customer on this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,that or people decide to recognize their value more appropriately and the value of digital goods will move towards zero.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"the point isn't about what happens to your stuff after you die, it's that you can't leave it to someone else if you even wanted to down the line"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i don't care either, but i think the article is using steamgameinheritance to show the extent of how users don't actually own any of the stuff they buy. while valve has been pretty fair to their users so far, who knows what could happen in the future"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i kinda care. i don't necessarily care who gets my stuff, but i do care who doesn't get my stuff. like, i don't want it to going to a stranger, to a corporation, or to a government."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,i was thinking the same thing imagining a scenario where i'm 80 and i finally kick the bucket. if i die next week to some tragic accident. maybe i do want to transfer my shit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,yeah this post is basically saying that the technically none of the games are your stuff as you don't own them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,but people with children and siblings absolutely will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"i mean, my house and my bank account, sure, i care what happens to that and my will reflects that. but a bunch of digital rental licenses for games ive played over my life, i could not care less."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"it's not about what you individually want, it's about what's legally possible for willing people."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yeah. not like 75 of the people bitching are going to have anyone to leave it to anyways, permanent goblins camped out somewhere."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yeah, that's an obvious workaround. but we're talking about the legality of ownership."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,honestly it's the best thing i could leave to a surviving sibling. my gaming accounts are worth more than my car.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this is mentioned in the article but it's still not right that you cant pass on your property to your descendants. if you bought a game on a disc it wouldn't even be a question
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"they will, just give them the login info."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"of course not, because people with a lot of money need more of your money. yeah i'm sure in 50 years any potential heirs will care about playing your copy of call of duty 2024. just like i'm sure everyone in this thread plays the colecovision games their parents grew up on. i won't get a house, but i'm sure glad dad left me his steam catalog oh boy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,i will keep that in mind when i am 2 seconds away to get struck by a drunk driver.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"theres no way to officially, legally, do so. transferring your account is a tos violation in any situation, and letting steam know that happened at all, in any way, leads to that account getting bannedall access lost."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"yes,"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,there's steam account recovery codes which you can issue to your heirs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"til when i die, all my belongings die with me and can't be included in the pass down login info bit. shame"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if i remember correctly it depends on the protection the game uses, if it uses something like denuvo or similar the game may require you to reconnect at some point to play it how long varies"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"if the account is transferable then it can be sold without valve getting a cut and they won't suffer that. plus it's a huge loophole for scams and crap like that. not saying valve is right, they just have some really big reasons"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,same. who gives a shit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"first quote in the article, in paragraph 2  unfortunately, steam accounts  are nontransferable if i understand this correctly, inheriting would be a transfer of the account, meaning you would not inherit the account with all the games without breaking steam terms."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i have no idea what you're talking about. my gaming achievements will ripple throughout time and be revered by all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"give us a brief rundown of how, legally please?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if buying isnt owning piracy isnt theft.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"do you kids wanna go on a treasure hunt to find grandpa's video games? no, he didn't even have any robuxx"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"buying a game on steam is buying a license to download and play that game, since the licensee you is dead, so no not really."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,they probably won't. not until account ages start to go way over human lifespans.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,well thats enough reddit for me today.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,that actually doesn't sound that bad. the concept of reincarnation is what really scares me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"we ceased to be prior to being born, yet all those mentioned things are still alive. time is only an observable phenomena. in death, there is presumably no concept of time, and if parallel universe do exist, there's nothing stopping someone being born in a parallel universe that is only just now giving way to dinosaurs or maybe you'll be born on an alien planet on a far end of a universe altogether. regardless, even in the death of the universe, this one was once born, and it, too, could collapse on itself and perhaps give way to a new big bang. some theorize that new universes could exist within black holes where mass is infinitely condensed upon itself. though that opens up a whole other can of worms, cause then people bring up white holes. the possibilities are literally endless. i don't think you can state one way or another with any level of confidence."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,they both get the login details and learn to share the time?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,hilarious.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,3. most things die with you. your property literally doesn't
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"its like books or films from our fathers. do you really read or see movies your parents had when they were young? hardly. i can say that my father left me a decent amount of records from the 70's. i cherish them deeply. the feeling of being able to hold something my father loved as much as his music collection and be able to allow his children to enjoy the same things is invaluable to me. if the riaa the us's biggest music corporation ever came to my home and said that they're adopting the same rules as digital game companies, i'd fight them. legally or physically. i wouldn't care. nobody's taking one of my strongest connections to my ancestor away from me. i'd feel the same about my grandparents books. even though i'm not a reader. it's not the thing itself, but the family connection we in the digital age are robbing our children of that inheritance. we owe it to our children to lovingly share and pass down our passions just as our parents did for us. anything less is a form of future theft from your own children. sure, maybe they won't want a collection i have. a few years ago i saw maybe 1,000 vhs tapes left for whoever wanted them. left behind from a family cleaning out. that's their choice though. not lawyers. not steams. theirs, and theirs alone. that's how it should be"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,that is a terrible example because i did watch movies and read books from my dad's collection
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,honestly my favorite books where discovered by reading my parents' collections. good stories are timeless regardless of the medium.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it seems the question revolves more around when you can't live with it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i have physical copies of a lot of old games. i can't play any of them without a windows 95 machine and a cd rom drive. i use things like gog and steam to ensure my games are compatible with future hardware.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,ok.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it actually kinda hurts seeing his account go online i'm sorry to hear that. it gets easier somewhat. if i do i hope someone finds their way into my steam account. someone has to play all those games and it sure as hell ain't gonna be me.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"most people steam account wont be over 6080 when they die, so let's assume valve imposes a hard 120 year old account get banned, you still would have some 4060 years, if you inherited it in your 20s30s,it might as well last 2 person lifespans"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,steam isn't likely to last 150 years judging by the history of companies in history. it's very likely it will be acquired at some point or acquired and shut down or at one point even if it still sell the cash flow is bad at the bad time 9wrong time wrong place . all companies go throught such a cycle it says nothing of the quality of steam management  which is another risk as well  management change and it make a lot of customer unhappy see ea in early 2010s and riticiello lootboxes. personally minutes before i die ill post my credentials in rsteamgiveaway
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,steam will go to shit after gabe dies

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this will be proof that vampire exists
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,makes sense to me. kinda like how all steam users share the same birthday of january 1st. im sure its fine.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"steam thinks i'm 124 years old, so they'll believe anything."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,150 is the number being used on every single comment of this sentiment. just a weird correlation.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,thats exactly what i thought.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"alot of the games will be in the public domain by then anyway, it's just anything new they purchase on the account, like assassins creed 87 antarctica boogaloo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,then you get a message you still alive?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,bold of you to assume valve will last long after gaben dies. that man keeps that ship running in the right direction.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if it's 150 and someone still buying new games they are not going to care.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,send someone out to check out this eugene tooms guy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"if steam can accept age verification saying that i was born in 1900, then it can also accept that i'm 124 years old."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,sounds like the mediterranean diet
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,well it thinks im currently 108 years old
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i mean, the owner was born on january 1, 1900, so it checks out..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if the steam servers are still working on 150 years and we haven't evolved beyond simple commodity accumulation i think we'll have bigger problems
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"when steam asks your age to view videos i used to pick 1908, always wondered how many steam players are 100 lmao"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"my account is over 18 years old, yet steam will probably never stop asking me to confirm my age when viewing pages for games with mature content."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"hmmmmm, why does this account name connor macleod ring a bell?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,... and they just purchased skyrim 37!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,and it will still ask you to confirm if you are over 18.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,if they complain sue them for racial discrimination against vampires or something

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"back when the age verification thing was popping constantly i did set it up to 01.01.1900 and it remains so. i reckon a lot of other users have done something similar, so there are probably a lot of 124 year old users already."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,as if most of these games will be run in 30 years...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"isn't everyone's birthday jan. 1st, 1901?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i sure hope it's around that long. i've got a backlog of games to play once i retire in 20 years
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,steam already thinks i'm 150 so nbd probably
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,maybe he turned or not?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"bruh.. what a wanker, that's fucked."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,that's death penalty status.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,thank whatever god up there that i only got 1 friend who gives a shit about gaming in general lmfao
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,can you cite the case
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"valve is 400 people and practically operates like an indie company. there is no consistent rule enforcement like you would see codified and followed to the letter in a big corp. that's a double edged sword, but that is a discussion for another day. the point is, the person who happened upon your ticket decided to do you a favour. you rolled a dice and won this time. next time you might not be so lucky."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,that would do absolutely nothing. steam accounts are non transferable. if steam finds out you died and left your account to someone it would be banned. shitty ik so you're better off just leaving them the password and 2fa access like the other person said and idk maybe a note that says to never admit the original owner is dead or something
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,only the person activating the game license on their account is allowed to own the game. theres nothing to leave and theres no legal recourse you can technically leave it to a person in your will or estate but due to steam tos they will ban it if they ever realize someone else is using the account.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,it's a breach of terms because the account and the licenses are nontransferable. it's not your property to give to anyone else.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'm pretty sure steam has a game cafe account systemhttpspartner.steamgames.compccafe for exactly this reason...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'm sure you wouldn't have to dig too deep into most tos for video games to find that they're for personal use only and that commercial licenses are separate. maybe i'm wrong but someone would have to actually read those things to prove it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"ianal, but an llc is technically an artificial person, and for all purposes of all the law can be treated as such. absolutely not. corporate personhood is what's known as a legal fiction, meaning we all know it's untrue, but treat it as if it's true in very specific circumstances. there is absolutely no such thing as for all purposes of the law for corporate personhood. corporations cannot be held responsible for crimes, for example. they can be held civilly liable  they can be sued. that's the primary reason corporate personhood exists. in most areas, they are not treated like people under the law."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,given streamers tend to have an llc when they get an influx of cash i imagine they would be the legal source to talk to about game licenses and llc.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,thats a cool thought and all but steam accounts are nontransferable so youd have to start a fresh account under an llc  you cant give your existing one to a new llc legally.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,removed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"steam, or any other vendor, can refuse to sell their product to an llc or any other legal entity solely because they are not a natural person. being a nonnatural person is not a protected class"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i'm just imagining a first amendment case because steam limited a corporation's 'speech' by banning the account.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"well, don't tell them where you wrote it, but rather put it in a will or something. so that it can only be accessed at a time when it needs to be accessed."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,this is actually what everybody should do. keep your passwords in a bank vault and when you die its easier to gain access to your bank vault as next of kin then many of these online stores.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,till death do us part clicks accept without reading the tos
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i doubt this is something they would actually enforce even if they found out. pretty sure it's just there to cover themselves legally. the tos says no account sharing which is something millions of users have probably done but no one gets banned for it. it's not even hard to detect because you obviously didn't travel across the country within a few seconds to login to your account
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i was born in '69. my steam self, i mean. same month and day, though, birthday twin."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"just fyi, some steam games work that way too. as in, you can copy them to a hdd and anybody can play them. so your entire library isn't lost. but anything with centralized online multiplayer probably is.."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,come to rdatahoarder we have backup for the backup of all our games

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,not when i set it to private now!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,well that would be something if steam was still around in 100 years
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"can second this. there was a post awhile back about a dude who had been using his deceased brother's steam account, something went wrong and he had to contact support about an issue with a game, and when he revealed he was using his brother's account, the support agent was forced to permanently lock the account. steam is usually pretty lax with the whole service, not goods thing, they don't really care if you ignore steam to launch games without going through their launcher, move the game to a different hard drive, play offline, whatever  most single or local coop games you buy on steam, you can run without steam if you need to, some even if you've gotten banned. but their tos is pretty black and white accounts and games are nontransferable, granted to the specific person and subject to being withdrawn when deemed necessary, and if you literally tell them you are breaking their tos or are caught cheating andor involved in money shenanigans, they won't ignore it, and you could find yourself without the ability to play any of your games that require online access. that's pretty tame in the grand scheme of things, but you can see how games are a service, not a good can go wrong when you look at how blizzard handles overwatch. did you buy overwatch 1? too bad, it's gone. you cannot play overwatch 1, your license to play it has been revoked. blizzard shows how a service can vanish based on the whims of a distributor, even towards users who violate no rules and followed tos to a t. hell, chinese players can't even play overwatch 2, because due to an expiring contract with their chinese contacts, blizzard can't run ow2 in china, removing access to a game they once invested time and money into. we can see how this world of licensed gaming can be much different depending on who's running the show. this is a big reason why so many people push for drmfree games, as even if you are 'buying a license', in practice you will usually be able to keep the game as long as it survives on your hard drive."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"which is exactly the problem with today's video game economy, and literally everyone should denounce this bullshit. get your congress to actually think about this subject in the context of ownership and figure it out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"i think they term they use is a license. steam sells you a license to play the game. the license is what game developers and publishers give steam distribution rights for. so yeah, as per legislation, the right term for it is service and not a goods, and in the software and tech world we started using the word license to be more specific."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,just add your login credentials to your will.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,way back in the day i bought a physical valve game and got a code which forced me to make a steam account and download it so was it a good or a service
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"software, for a long time has been a good. you were always able to hand someone a floppy disk or a cd and a key and they then owned that copy. this bs with software as a service has only started in the last like 15 years."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,pretty much this. the steam agreement states that you are only a subscriber to the steam services and that valve owns everything you purchase. in return you get a personal noncommerical license to use the software according the user agreement
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it depends on the country. in the eu they are sold as goods.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"that's why this needs reform and regulation. if you buy something, you should own it, which includes resale and inheritance. if someone expects the item back if they change their mind later, it's not buying, it's leasing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yeah, you dont own a digital game or product. you own a license to use the digital item which can be revoked for a multitude of reasons."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yeah. for video games, i think a lifetime is long enough."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"because you dont. you know that little checkbox valve forces you to check every time you spend money on steam that says you have read and agree to the steam subscriber agreementhttpsstore.steampowered.comsubscriberagreement? clear as day, under the 'licences heading  the content and services are licensed, not sold. its not an argument, its a basic fact that you have already agreed to."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i think people are overestimating the interest their children will have in the games they played
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"that's... a concern about what happens to my stuff after i die, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,you accepted that when you clicked the little check box before buying the games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"i mean, that's why this news is worrisome to me. i have serious health issues, so i'm never entirely sure that i'll make it to old age. i have a pretty expansive steam library and would love to make someone in my family happy with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i have both and still dont. and they are in a family account with me and will always have access through that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,but what if my nephew's grandson is curious about halflife in the year 2104? i wouldn't want him to pay 34 to buy his own copy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i agree with one of the replies. stuff with signifiant value like a house or car i agree. my steam library isnt one of them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i mean i was born in 2002 and i still play a lot of games released in the 90s on my pc. my parents weren't gamers but i would have loved it if they were and left their old gaming systems to me. not sure why something would stop being fun just because it's old? fun games are fun games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,my mom didnt pay for storage and our atari was sold at auction. i would still be playing it now if that hadnt happened
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"pretty ignorant lol. and here i am paying for a yearly family subscription and buying extra nintendo switches so my mom can enjoy her oldschool mario games easily. guess you like that shit, huh? would be awesome if older games were more accessible to a wider audience, but nah. just charge people over and over again for the same shit theyve already paid for. and make sure their kids have to pay for it too. nostalgia is pretty cool, internet chad."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"there is no consistent rule enforcement like you would see codified and followed to the letter in a big corp. yes, one thing ive heard complained alot about is steam deciding on adult games. adult game devs will get a game unapproved, resubmit it with zero changes, and have it approved. 2 different games with the same level of adult content will end up with one approved and one not approved. it seems like they just leave the approval process up to whichever person is in charge of it that day. just cross your fingers and hope the prude isn't working that day lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,maybe i should get a steam account registered to a trust.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,isnt it possible to gift games you have to someone else over steam? so in theory you can just gift all the games from the dead relative to a new steam account and presto no issues? or is it just at the time of purchase?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"but like, short of just straight up telling a steam employee to their face, how would they know?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,you will own nothing and be happy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,you're not wrong but this is just more proof that digital only is fucking terrible for consumers
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,yeah if you buy individual game licenses for a cafe environment all the licenses are null and void anyways
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,that is actually really cool. huh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"absolutely, most games give just personal licenses. most games go with a standard format for licenses big companies like nintendo who can afford a legal team will of course fine tune the wording in the documents. i shouldve been specific. personal vs. commercial licenses for games are different. i guess i went into the two to give an example of why licenses differ on a case to case basis. but anyways because i did once look into obtaining a commercial license and permission for a video game, i do know a tiny bit about it. for most streamers and such i dont think you need a commercial license. but if you want to produce a machinima show like red vs blue, then you need either a commercial license, or permission from the game company. setting up and arcade as well, needs commercial licenses. as you are just a vendor of the game, not a consumer of the game as for using an llc just to be able to own the games, you might need some kind of internal reason or company objective, which explains why money was spent on these games. for instance, you have plans to develop a game in 10 years, so naturally you need to buy games for your research. it doesnt matter if you never end up making the game, you can always say you tried and failed lol. so long as it is recorded somewhere in the minutes of the meeting. just as an extra precaution"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"an llc is a limited liability company. the whole purpose of it is to prevent yourself from being liable for debt and such. it also can act as a person, meaning it can own property and such. when you make an llc it is like youve made a new person. your llc being your uncle or sibling? that needs clarification. they can be shareholders, i.e. owners of the company. or they can be employees, i.e. agents acting on behalf of the company. as for whether you mean that things owned by the company can be used by both you and a sibiling? not for software. again, you are only accessing the software by being granted a license, and the terms of the license will clearly state that this is for one user only or two users, or up to 2 machines or something, but it is written in the licensing agreement. then it will also state the purpose the usage, whether they grant personal usage or commercial usage and a lot of finer details. some companies do grant large scale licenses, like buying ms word for 100 people, for an office, and it will be at a discounted rate. but yeah, i encourage everyone to do their own reading. especially with software!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"absolutely, it is within the fine print of the software and it varies on a case to case basis. there is no blanket rule for all software. well, the only blanket agreement i can think of is the standard licensing agreement which steam uses for its entire store, maybe not for big game companies who negotiate their own terms. its the licensing agreement they slap on every game in their store, especially to help indie developers who cannot afford a legal team. here having steam apply their standard eula is extremely helpful. its like when you start a company, you need to write the companys constitution, the articles of association. now naturally not every business has enough legal expertise to build this document so there are a few templates the government offers which you can choose from. and then of course later amend it to suit your business."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,how exactly would anybody's speech rights be violated there?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,fuck the tos.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"don't trust it though, test it. steam in the last ten years has retroactively hijacked the runtime libraries within the game installs it downloads, swaps it with clone files which also does some steam.api calls, which wont let the game launch if you do not have steam installed which if it is, has you log in and then will deny you playing said game because its not from the same account. actually i think it even rejected me one time because it was from a different windows install when i tried to force that to work by logging in the correct account."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"makes 0 sense even from a service level. why would the brother get banned from an account he has access to. does the account belong to the person who created it, the person who's used it most, the person who's last used it, or the person who's card was used for individual purchases? my account, created for me by my brother when i was a child 20 years ago using one of his emails, uses mine, my parents, and my girlfriends cards to purchase games. who owns the account? it's impossible for them to even prove who's account it is, his or the brothers, as long as he has access to it. if he doesn't have the login than he might as well be a hacker trying to access it through support, which would make sense, but if he has the credentials, he owns the account."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"this is the right answer. the license agreement was always there, even in the old times with some floppy discs, later with cd's and dvd's, now with downloads from steam, you always have the license. and this license is usually for yourself, not for other people. the publishers still have power, like with the multiplayer games, they can shut down servers which makes some games unplayable, but that's just written in the license agreement you have to accept when you buy and install it. the licenses usually also contain things like in the old times with physical copies, that you were not allowed to use such versions for rent, you couldn't charge anyone else money and give him the copy for some time, that wasn't allowed. for movies, like dvd's, the licenses do not allow that you show the movie in public, which would be like a cinema theater. you can also own a license just for some time, like with subscription models for mmo's and other stuff. i'm not sure if you can legal transfer the licenses as kind of inheritance, i don't think so. i mean, you can of course just let someone else access the account, but just like some people here mentioned, when it gets known by the support, they can lock you out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-24,"it's sold service to the individual, wouldn't be surprise if they van accounts for good every 100 years."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"grandpa left me his 70 year old game library... yay i mean, i wouldn't even want to play 99 of the 30 year old games on atari that my mom still has in the closet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"yes and people are also overestimating the permanence of physical digital items. i have been playing games for over 30 years now so probably a lot of people don't have this perspective but even games where you own physical copies have effective shelf lives. my old boxes full of floppies are completely unusable for me. i don't have any drives that can read them anymore. even for things where that's not the case, like old cds, they become largely useless for software compatibility reasons. try slapping a windows 95 game into your drive and see if you can get it to run  probably not. and soon optical drives will be gone too. the only real way to play a lot of old games is to pirate them, even if you already own them. your kids will get no more out of your boxes of blu rays than out of a steam account that gets locked."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,it's a way to connect with a parent that's no longer around. it's common for people to try out new things that a loved one used to do in order to understand them a little better

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"its like redditors are incapable of loving relationships. i have saved games from loved ones that have passed on that i can explore. literally priceless. my kids love my stream library, it would be great to leave my library to my eldest daughter"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"good for you, doesnt mean everyone needs to agree with that though. my steam collection is tiny but i could see a case for people with thousands of games and game saves theyve created with their children wanting to leave their account behind to them. hopefully the eu will sort this nonsense out, as its the law in at least germany that everything a person owns is inheritable, including digital assets. tos technicalities like you dont own you rent the service yadda, yadda dont usually fly when eu consumer protection laws are drafted."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,i apologies!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,corporations can do whatever they want with their platforms. it does not implicate the first amendment at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-05-25,"as the other person said, only the government is bound by the first amendment's protection of speech. it has no jurisdiction over private contracts or business relationships between private entities. congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech in citizens united v. fec, scotus simply ruled that the government can not engage in censorship, even when that censorship is done indirectly by limiting the spending of organizations nor when that censorship is done in specific time periods that the bcra set within certain periods of elections and political party conventions. personhood was not necessary to rule that corporations are included in the first amendment's protection of speech. in fact, corporate personhood was not even mentioned at all in the ruling. the first amendment court simply relied on the fact that the government cannot violate freedom of speech regardless of the entity that produces the speech. this was not invented by citizens untied, we have a long history of the government protecting speech of organizations simply on the basis of it being protected speech see joseph burstyn, inc. v. wilsonhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikijosephburstyn,inc.v.wilson and freedom freedman v. marylandhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikifreedmanv.maryland for examples regarding films. corporate personhood was not necessary to find that censorship of films produced by organizations was unconstitutional it doesn't mean that any spending of money becomes speech and thus protected. the spending of money is considered protected for the purposes of speech when spent for the purposes of speech. this means the government cannot be allowed to prevent money from being spent to produce speech publishing books, movies, music recordings, etc., because this creates a blatant loophole that could be used to censor speech. that's the extent of it. it certainly opened up a can of worms that we should work on fixing which is really more of a symptom of the concentration of wealth and power, but i do believe that it was the correct ruling. as an aside, the aclu offers ways to solve this that respect our constitutional rightshttpswww.aclu.orgwpcontentuploadsdocumentcampaignfinancestatement32712final0.pdf my favorite of which would be to greatly expand the amount of and access to public campaign funds."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"am i the only one that just throught limbo was okay? i didn't think it was bad by any standards, but other than the art style, nothing really stood out about it to me. once i beat it, i just sort of went hmm, that was pretty neat, and that was it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"holy shit, anyone know who was the artist that did this?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,that is so impressive! that game has the best imagery and beautiful even being just black and white
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"yikes. i got a kick out of that game for a few hours, but i can't imagine getting a fucking sleeve for it. unless it was cleverly designed to disguise a bunch of neonazi tattoos from a misguided time, rather than undergo years of painful surgeries to get them removed, then i'd say it's a very smart move."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"i really like gaming tattoos that does not say the games name or something like that, i like it when it is something subtle that an average person who does not game can kind of understand, i think that tattoos with game names in are fucking terrible."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i would be willing to pay good money to get a tattoo like that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,that is an really impressive tattoo! i love it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,are you saying my day one garry's incident full back and double sleeve tat was a bad idea?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"it's odd that where a piece of art originated is somehow relevant. like, if this image wasn't from a video game, it would somehow be a more respectable tattoo. i don't get that. it's the same art. it's a cool piece."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,god forbid someone get a tattoo because they like the aesthetics of it or it represents a period of time in their life. not all tattoos have to remain relevant for 60 years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"this is by far the most repeated comment in this thread. maybe she just likes the art style of limbo, and also liked the experience... the tattoo does have aesthetic value guys. chill out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,brothers tale of two sons lasted only 3 hours and it's one of the most impactful and highly recommended games i've played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"hey grandma, what was braid?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,way to be closed minded. there are plenty of scenarios where this tattoo would mean more to someone than you're taking at face value. also it's well done and looks great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,or maybe some beautiful art about a boy trying to rescue his sister?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,haha ya it took me a while... i'm replaying it right now actually and i'm stuck on one part i can't get past. clearly my memory is not so great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,limbo is quite a bit deeper than the game itself. just like lord of flies and catcher in the rye were not just a story. even for people who never played the game you get an idea of what the tats about.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"seriously.. it was a nice game, but ultimately quite forgetful. why get a tat of a game with nearly no replay value? ok, why get a tat of a game at all, but that's beside the point"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"yeah, i'd only ever do this if i was directly involved in its development."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"maybe the concept of being lost and innocent in a world out to get you resonated with her, god forbid."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,da vinci? what's your painting about? it was some girl i met back in like 1500 and i talked to her for a few minutes and never talked to her again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,not every tattoo needs some deep weird meaning or story behind it. half of the time when someone tells a story behind their tattoo it sounds cheesy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i got it to show everyone what a whore i was...that's how we got your mom, and eventually you, little shartbuckit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"this isn't a normal 'oh it'll become blurry because of age' comment that you usually see outside of rtattoos. the buildings in the back don't have black lines to hold in the colour, so it's way more likely to start 'bleeding' out. the owner of this may get lucky though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,this tattoo will age just fine. this is an opinion from someone with a decade of experience. contrast is in all the important places.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,read?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"tattoos don't work that way, dipshit. i have tattoos that are eight years old. lines are still distinct from one another."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,it's an eerily beautiful title.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i found it really dull. the gameplay is pretty basic and unless you're completely engrossed by the artstyle admittedly it's fairly unique and ambient, but i didn't find it enough to carry the game i don't see what one would get out of it. it takes like 2 hours to complete, so probably worth picking up in a sale if there's a chance you'll like it as much as the people who rave about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,agreed. anybody know what systems this is on?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i was just thinking how odd it was that the boob was perfectly framed inside the photo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,and that's how babies are made.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"the art is beautiful, i played the game several times just to look at the art work."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,tbh i don't think it matters if its from game or not as long as it looks cool. as a games who knows this game i can appreciate it more but it's awesome enough for a stranger without gaming knowledge to like it too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,my rule of thumb is that the time it takes to get the tattoo should not be longer than the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,willing to bet the tattoo took longer to make than the average play length of the game

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i don't think that it is. i think the 'roll' in the top left is just a black tree that aligns with her shoulder.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"honestly i thought this game was one of the most beautiful and interesting indie games i've ever played. it was short, but they managed to do a lot with a very basic framework. i get what you're saying, like it's a very specific thing to get for a sleeve that might be completely irrelevant in 20 years but it could mean much more to her than you'll ever know."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i hate how every tattoo has to have a story behind it. fucking annoying.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,this idea that people are going to regret their tattoo's as soon as they hit 30 is kind of a myth. i get the impression that the people that perpetuate it are kind of underexposed. quality sleeve  monster logo on forehead.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,says the guy commenting on the gaming subreddit of reddit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,because perhaps people aren't all as insecure of their hobbies as you are?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,not sure if you know what sideboob is...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,yea because when she's 80 she's gonna be showing off her sleeve to all the men she's trying to pick up
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,when shes 80 that game would be 60 years ago say she is 20. shes stupid. ... speaking of stupid people.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i honestly did not notice a boob till you said that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i love creepy reddit nerds
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,you know this tattoo is amazing because i didn't even realize they we're in the picture until i read your comment.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"white ink looks great when the tattoo is fairly new, but it's usually one of the first colors to start fading."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,it's because white fades extremely fast. i believe they will need to get that touched up frequently for it to maintain this look.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,white always just looks like scar tissue when i've seen it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i can't even count the number of tattoos i've seen on the internet that were actually magic marker or paint... but this one looks like it might just be really fresh swelling  bright white ink.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"it's fresh, it'll fade out a little bit, although it looks like it's in there fairly well. source am tattooer"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"yeah kinda what i was thinking. i thought the pic was taken in black and white or applied a filter or something until i saw her upper arm practically the shoulder being a skin tone. now i know people get sleeves all the time, so their arms can be totally coated in ink, but if this is a real tattoo, all that stippling needing to be done to get the mistyfoggy look must've been incredibly time consuming and painful, considering the level of detail and contrast to the black. that last part alone makes me think its body paint instead, and was airbrushed or something"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,i'm convinced 90 of strange or awesome tattoos on the internet are body paint.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"everyone's bringing up the white, but i think it's the black on the bodyhead that looks most suspicious. not saying it isn't possible, but that is incredibly crisp and dark."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i don't think there is much white ink being used as its just a solid black and grey
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,hopefully it is. who would want a limbo tattoo?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,nope definitely a tattoo. looks like the only straight up white they used was in the eyes and highlighting features like the thing he's standing on. white as a highlight isn't so bad and will always stay a bit more noticeably white when alongside a dark contrasting color. the background was pulled off well with an off whitegrey for the lightest area. so nicely done!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i'm okay with that. i look forward to interpreting this story in a good couple playthroughs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"which i have no problem with. even if its just some game that strives to be something like limbo, it is, from what i can see, in a direction that i welcome."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,sounds good to me!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,what next grandma? did you also beat qwop?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"considering my name is gary, no. fantastic idea."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,i got a space marines tat before it came out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,grandma what is your tattoo oh there was a period of time in my life when i played a 3 hour indy game and i liked the aesthetics of it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"except yes, they do because they're on your body forever"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,they should if they're going to last 60 years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"why would someone use the image of a short game to represent a significant period of their life? i can understand if for some reason the game kept this guy sane, like if the game had some magical impact on their life, but eh. getting a tattoo seems like a big deal to me. it makes little sense to me if someone just gets a picture of an indie video game printed onto their skin forever because it 'looks awesome'. everyone thinks differently though, and i shouldn't judge."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"not all tattoos have to remain relevant for 60 years. they'd probably have to be relevant to the person, or else it shouldn't be permanent. there's a way to remind yourself about a game and about a period of your life without making a permanent tattoo of it. it's called owning the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,yeah i thought it was great too but i wouldn't get a tattoo of it on my body
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"limbo is full of the typical mysterious depth you see in indie games that try to look deep by having an unclearno storyline. it's dead easy to create the impression of depth, and most indie game makers do exactly and only that. creating real depth is much much much more difficult, and is quite beyond many game makers. most of the deepest games only just touch on real depth."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"lol, replay value plays into tattoo worth now? seriously what?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"like the art style? i have no issue with the concept of simply putting a beautiful piece of art on my body. i have a lot more of an issue with putting the name of another person on me then a piece of art i think is beautiful. in fact i have a lot more of an issue with putting the name or symbol of a sports team on me then i do with some beautiful art. my opinion on what art i think is beautiful is far less likely to change then my opinion about a person, sports team or something else but this is just me, you likely have a different opinion"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i mean, maybe it has less to do with the game and more to do with the subject. the character is this young boy lost in limbo looking for something, i believe, and the imagery and background associated with the tattoo are more likely to be the reason for getting the tattoo as opposed to i really like this game i want a tattoo of it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i'm gonna assume you weren't there in the beginning when everyone was trying to find the eggs. it was a very memorable and enjoyable experience for me. still one of the best indies to come out, imo. the replayability comes from finding the eggs and trying for nodeath runs, speed runs, etc., if that isn't your cup of tea obviously you won't find any replay value. there is very limited replay value in every single player game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,actual human  video game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,so like which side are you arguing here
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,that's not true. you don't need black lines you only need contrast. also grey wash doesn't really bleed out a black line is more likely to expand than greywash. rtattoos spreads a lot of misinformation.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"black lines to hold in the color? i don't think you understand how tattoos work. it's not a 'coloring inside the lines thing' it's ink suspended in your skin. 'bleeding' in tattoos is from ink settling in your skin, and it's more likely to happen extremely if it was done too deeply, or went over too many times."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,as long as it is covered and has sunscreen if it ever sees light should be okay ish but i'm not a professional
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i'll take your word for it. i've only had second hand experience, but i've seen the result of similar images not aging very well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"in things artistic like design, painting, and creating ads etc, reading means whether or not something is coming across to the viewer. he's saying that the shapes may muddle and fade over time so you won't be able to get a read on any of the shapes."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,the game's pretty good too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,it's without the doubt the most amazing game i've ever played. the ending...just blew me away.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i love everything about the aesthetic of the game but overall i agree with you. i've set out to finish it several times and have always lost interest before the end and i am a platformer fanatic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"xbox live arcade, steam mac osx, windows, linux, ps3 are the platforms i think it is on. i got it on linux and it can be very unstable, though."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"it does what it does very well, but i think it's much more like a movie than a game. similar to dear esther in many ways. i can totally understand that some people don't like it though"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"yeah, if found it to be pretty boring. its like 90 running to the right and looking at the scenery."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i'd say it's a good example of a casual game. i enjoyed it because i am terrible at platform games, so it fit the bill for me, but it is certainly not going to be remembered as an exceptional or even very good game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i really don't think it's a circlejerk. it had style, plenty of hard puzzles, atmosphere and humor remember spider?. originality? well, there have been a few similar games, maybe afraid of the dark didn't play that far, but i think it's reasonably original these days. i think it was a very good game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,if you use the good ink your colors should stay looking as good as new unless it's on a joint. joints always need touch ups no matter the color. unfortunitly tattooing is often done with less expensive ink that stay bright for a few years if that.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"yes, to the person. everyone in these comments is saying how no one will remember limbo or was the game really good enough to get a tattoo of it permanently? the person with the tattoo will remember it, and if it's important to them, that's all that matters. even if it's not important to them, it's well done and looks cool. tons of people have tattoos for that exact reason. not everything has to have a deep meaning.  there's a way to remind yourself about a game and about a period of your life without making a permanent tattoo of it. it's called owning the game. this point is completely invalid. there is a way to remind yourself about literally anything and any period in your life without making a permanent tattoo of it. by that logic, no one should ever get a tattoo ever. it's someone's body, it's artwork that they decided they wanted on it, and if people want to criticize the subject matter of that artwork then they can fuck right off."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,very true. you're brain will actually perceive lines or edges down the middle of two neighboring shades of grayblack due to lateral inhibition. so even if you don't draw black lines your brain will still perceive edges due to the contrast.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,to be fair i had been told that outside of rtattoos but if that's the case then fair enough!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"like i said to the other guy, it's how it was explained to me when i first started getting tattooed, so i guess the guy who did it wasn't clued up himself haha."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"this tattoo would require more caretouchup work to keep it looking good, yes. and the shading required to achieve the effects of the buildings might not be easy for every artist to replicate so you would want to go back to the same guy or someone similar. but as long as you take care of it. nbd"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"huh, so i do like reading after all. i'm gonna add that to things i like to do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,really? that's odd. are you sure? getting a read on something is referring to tracking isn't it? as in the death star got a read on alderaan and blew it the fuck up. either way it's easier to just use other words like that's going to fade and be hard to make out. reading implies there are words to read.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,no.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,idk man i'm usually a pussy with pain. all my tattoos have just felt like someone scratching their nails on my skin. the only one that actually hurt was my inner elbow and that wasn't even too bad.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i think the location of your tattoo is more likely to result in pain. shins are usually pretty paintolerant compared to fleshier parts of your body. shading hurt on my tattoo just because of the sheer amount of time it took, i started to feel really raw at the end of it. mine was on my shoulderblade, and overall it wasn't too much of a sharp pain, just a dull one like a bad sunburn. don't know about the white ink"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"the only reason people say white ink hurts more is because it's the last thing you do, and by that point the skin is already pretty raw."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"the color doesn't do anything. line work however does hurt more because of the the of needle, angle of attack and line work moves the needle faster so you get poked more. shading and color are usually much softer and the needle moves slower."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,how's summer vacation treating you? any family trips to the beach?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"it doesn't really fade or turn yellow... when the tattoo is fresh, the top layers of skin are damaged basically a big scrape from the repeated puncturing, and the ink saturates the skin all the way to the surface, so you see light hitting the ink directly. then the tattoo heals, scabs over, new layers of skin are deposited over the ink, and the scab peelssloughs away anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on the depth of the injury... usually for me it's about 2 weeks. when the tattoo is fully healed there are a couple layers of new healthy skin overlaying the ink which is locked in subdermally. whatever color your skin is will tint the color of the ink reflected back when light hits it. for darker, more saturated colors, this effect is less noticeable. but usually you'll notice that blacks are never quite as black as they were on the day of tattooing, and the same is true of whites. probably this photo was taken by the artist for their portfolio right after the session when it was basically still a fresh wound. or she has extremely pale skin but i'd put my money on the former. edit if you lightly scrapescratch a healed white tattoo, you'll see the white color brightly again, until it heals. edit2 here's my arm right after a sessionhttpsocialskinstattoo.combryanextrabrian, pretty much everywhere you see white ink in that photo just looks flesh colored today"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,some people just love to criticize everything.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,totally agree i've got a load of tattoos. better not do anything ever because of what might or might not happen when you get older. sounds like a boring life.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i'm sorry, i dont mean to be condescending, but that's pretty basic english. it isn't even my first language , reading can be a synonym to interpreting and perceiving, just much as it can literally mean understanding of written language."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"read can simply mean interpret data. it is not constrained to written words, though that is the most common usage. do you read me? is an inquiry often used to ask if one is heard or understood and i read you is just an affirmative response that means one can understand what the other is saying. reading a file on a computer is to pull in bytes that could represent anything and are not tied to characterswords. as the previous comment mentions, read in visual designart can mean communicating the purposemessageintent of the piece."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,yeah im sure. i've been working in advertising a long time and hear it almost every day. just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean its odd.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"well, i guess that's where the term comes from the world of fine art. and we all know how full of itself the art world can be. they never miss an opportunity to make something sound more important than it is. and then when it's used for something that has even less artistic merit, such as a clickbait article on gaming, it just sounds goofy. it mostly seems to apply to things striving to be serious as well you would never call a press release a piece. or hey look at this piece my kid drew at school today. no i don't think so. sorry for the rant, but it's been a pet peeve of mine for months."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i think it's more that the aesthetics of the game lend themselves well to a tattoo even devoid of context.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,it's pretty. tattoos don't need meaning any more than your clothes or haircut or jewelry do. they're just more permanent

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"yes, the game is a lot of fun and somewhat challenging. imho, i wouldn't want a permanent reminder of it on my body for the rest of life. i just wouldn't want to explain what it represents 20 years from now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"it's a really funexciting game for sure but it's also easily one of the most beautiful games i've ever played, aesthetically speaking. there were several occasions many of them involving the gigantic spiders that i would jump out of my chair while playing. i'm getting a bit of an adrenaline buzz just thinking about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"well at least it's the kind of tattoo that in the eyes of the majority of the population, they'll have no ideas it's from a video game and they'll just think it's an artsy tattoo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i don't like the game at all but the tattoo is cool and to be clear i'm not a big puzzle platformer guy so i don't really like it because of that not because theirs anything wrong with the game i heard it's beloved.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,demo? someone took the plunge and got themselves limbo inked for life. it's 9.99 on steam with an 88 metacritic rating. i think you can spare a few pennies a day to save up and buy it when it is 95 off during the next steam sale.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"maybe this was the perfect moment for the plunge. you don't take it lightly. maybe this was the first game this person ever finished because they loved it and it did pack that much meaning. people get all sorts of tattoos. appliances like toasters, microwaves, blenders. tattoos of dwight schrute. i guess all things considered, a tattoo of limbo is better than the name of your girlfriend or boyfriend  limbo will always be limbo."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,god forbid you recommend a tattoo to someone also. i did once when someone asked for ideas about something that might complement a piece they already had. people got all over me telling me i should never make recommendations about other people's bodies and how they should be allowed to get what they want... after they fucking asked for anyone's input. that's honestly the shittiest sub to comment in though. tell someone their tattoo looks nice and someone will tell you're wrong and that it'll degrade heavily. politely tell someone you don't like it and get some snarky fools telling you not to judge based on other people's preferences and just being all around unpleasant.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-08-10,"it all really depends on well it's looked after. don't forget sunscreen, touch it up whenever necessary, and keep it moisturized whenever it's covered. that's all i do and mine looks absolutely fine after 5 years i don't have much as of now though to be fair. this tattoo shouldn't look any worse than any other as long the owner keeps up with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i'm not concerned with being misinformed about it because i can always ask my brother or the guys he works with. someone new to it might take what they say as gospel though because a lot of the misinformation gets upvoted while some factual info is downvoted. it's funny to me how quick some of the people there are to jump on others who they think are wrong while being incorrect themselves.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i don't recommend that, when the scrape heals you'll probably have visible scarslines. a you risk losing a bit of the color, and then when the skin heals that spot looks lighter b the tattoo needles are super fine and as long as the tattooist doesn't go too deep the injury is on a very macro micro level with very little scarring... when you scrape yourself at a macro level on, well, almost anything, it gouges out a larger area of skin and the scars are usually visible. i've got tiny scars from something like scraping my arm across a nailscrew during a house project, that didn't even draw blood, but leaves a faint visible line. if you really want your tattoo to look new again have your artist do some touch up to saturate the skin more, so the ratio of ink vs. skin reflecting the light is higher... but really just accept the fact the healed tattoo will never look as fresh as it does right after you get it. edited macro vs. micro"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"somebody call the cops up,"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"there are all white tattoos, and in the absence of any other contrasting colors next to them, they are visible against the skin... look like light scars not as bad as scarification though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,right? i'd make a pilgrimage to go get ink from this dude.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"wouldn't it be better to maybe take a screenshot, have someone airbrush it and put it up somewhere in your house? maybe even mount it over your bed so you can see it first thing in the morning, last thing before you fall asleep."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,exactly! i have a lot of big tattoos and a lot of people ask me what is their meaning. can't it just be pretty? they don't have any meaning.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i respectfully disagree. i will say that it's her body and she can do what she pleases with it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"i understand what you mean. but then again, do you have any tattoos? imagine explaining this tattoohttpimgur.comgallerymibhhi0 in the future."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"heh, maybe on the other arm is braid."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"i dunno man, after eight years my wife and i have both lost track of former artists two different guys. actually i know where mine is, but he won't do much good in prison"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"that's really unfortunate then. a big part of getting a tattoo is doing your own leg work. finding the reps of shops, checking portfolios, making sure everything is up to snuff at the shop. a good shop will never shy away from telling you what brands they use, how they clean and stuff. this should be basic knowledge for anyone interested in getting work done."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-26,"yep all shit looking that right there proves you are a troll. that claim is bullshit and you know it as well as i do. i don't like all tattoos, there are some godawful tattoos out there i fucking have one but to say that all tattoos are shit... you're either a troll or just incredibly stupid."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"as a contributor on the personal finance sub, most of the recommendations we make are based on advice from people like jack bogle founder of vanguard and dave ramsey who has excellent advice on how to get out of debt and some other reputable financial thinkers. the suggestions are usually pretty straightforward math, so the advice is repeatable. not to mention the people who have been following that advice in the sub have some excellent success stories."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,that's honestly the shittiest sub to comment in though. tell someone their tattoo looks nice and someone will tell you're wrong and that it'll degrade heavily. politely tell someone you don't like it and get some snarky fools telling you not to judge based on other people's preferences and just being all around unpleasant. switch a few words around and that is reddit as a whole.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"that's the entirety of the internet, and not the specific subreddit, though. that's what i'm saying. and particularly reddit. ridiculously dumb and flat out wrong shit often gets stated and upvoted to the top pretty much everywhere. sooner or later somebody comes along who actually knows what they're talking about and corrects it, etc, it's just the nature of open forums."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,i think the plural there is wrong at least where i live. california is a sub drenched state if artists here offered unlimited touch ups they'd never be able to get new clients in or make money
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"work would make sense to, but it's just the lingo. like any industry, eventually there reaches a point where the lingo is so dense that outsiders can't understand it. with tattooing, once you know the parts of the tattoo machine and some basic ink stuff, it's still pretty transparent to the outsider. read is just a thing they use instead of translate, though they use translate as well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,you probably wouldn't if you were part of the community that uses the word read in that situation.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,this was one of the easier puzzles imo. it's frustrating to watch the first video when its a pretty obvious solution.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-25,"boobs are awesome, but are they the best i've seen online or in real life? nah. pretty typical sizeshape. i was definitely drawn to the tattoo more so than the tits, that's all."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,"no he's saying he thinks they should mean something more than jewelry, but never went on to say why, only that it is her body to do whatever she likes with it. which makes his comment useless, why does he disagree?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,wait what. did you reply to the wrong person?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,maybe the meaning is that they look good? tattoo's don't need to be anything more than aesthetically interesting.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,absolutely. i edited my original statement. i really meant any reputable artist will give you a free touch up post healing to make sure the piece looks good.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2014-07-24,no i wasn't being sarcastic or anything. i do not think tattoos need meaning to be a valid reason for getting them. i'm fine with people getting tattoos purely because they like them

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,you should definitely try out inside if you haven't already.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,dark souls?!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"cool game, but i wouldn't tattoo it on me, i think there are many better games that deserve it more. also, really? try playing dark souls."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"to educate someone who knows nothing about tattoos, can you explain more?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,everyone is saying this but it won't be that bad. the black ink will barely fade whereas the greys will soften. this will create separation and more contrast over time. also it's very large so ink expansion won't be a big issue. it could have been done with more longevity in mind but it most likely won't turn into a blurry mess either.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"this was originally posted 2 years ago, i wonder if we can get a current picture of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,you can always get it touched up. it's a beautiful piece

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,my understanding was that if you go and get touch ups regularly then it will keep it looking fresh so long as you want. is this not the case?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"i said it further up and i'll say it again people don't get tattoos for other people to recognize, enjoy, or even notice. people get tattoos for their own reasons this game means something to this person  it is special and important to this person  and they memorialized it with a tattoo. doesn't matter if other people understand that or not."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,because it is their body and because they can. a tattoo doesnt have to have a global meaning for a person to want it. hell it doesnt have to have a meaning. also in 50 years it will likely look like crap and the person wont care how it looks or what others think of it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,an awesome game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-09,no shit. i got about half the way through it when i died. i then spent the next three months in the psych ward.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"limbo is much more difficult if you avoid guides. the game doesn't hold your hand and genuinely makes you feel like you solved something. it's level design is on par with portal in the sense that puzzles feel really organic. dark souls is try until you can't do it and google an exploit to get around an obstacle. you can't do that in limbo, you either fail or succeed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"wow, what an amazingly douchy response."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"i believe as you age and your skin loses its elasticity tattoos lose definition. all the subtle shading is going to be a lot closer to just one shade of black. that old guy you know with the faded, blurry tattoo on his forearm? it used to look a lot better."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"not an expert either, but faint shadings like that with no real outlines tend to just fade and bleed into one another as the skin heals, especially if the skin is exposed to much sun. you can get it touched up, but the skin can only take so much inking before it starts to scar. tattoos like this look great, just not for long. this is why the norm for tattoos is to have very heavy outlining."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"as you get older, the ink spreads out"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"according to thishttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vd0b7f5ubtoq awesome video, the ink is getting faded due to the fact that white cells actually treat ink particles as the enemy so slowly over the years they crush and eat big particles of ink. tldr white cells eats out your tattoo ink."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,here is an example of what sometimes and probably will happen for this tattoo goes on. httpcdn.epicthings.comappuploads20160226114024tattoo3.jpg
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"everybody's skin is different. i had people telling me not to get color tattoos because they fade and don't look as good as black and white, but i said fuck that, i like colors. i still have people asking me if my tattoos are fresh almost 10 years later. it also depends on the artist, if they fuck up your skin, the colors won't take properly. plus, tattoos arent the same as they were 60 years ago. there are different types of ink and new tattooing techniques which you never saw back in the day. my tattoos will probably hold up better than somebody's grandpa who got his in the navy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"to be fair, the sun is bad for all tattoos. you need to use heavy sunscreen if you want it stay good looking, but even then it's still going to fade. prolonged exposure to the sun is bad for skin in general."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"most people never get regular touch ups. they get the fresh tattoo, maaaaybe come back for a touch up session after it has healed, and then that is it. they may roll back into a shop 10 years later and ask for someone to clean it up but by that point, it's not going to look like it used to. you're better off accepting that it is going to fade and change over time, it's inevitable, rather than coming in every year for a touch up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,are we talking abt tatoo or boob?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"one of the reasons limbo was great was because of the art style. even if people don't recognize it, it's still looks fantastic."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"you're right that the ink will spread over time. but the old guy with faded tattoos also has a lot to do with how the needles worked back then. without capacitors old tattoo guns had a varied depth of penetration into the skin based on electrical surges. the deeper the ink in the skin, the easier for the lymphatic system to beak it down. modern tattoo guns have more uniform movement so it's easier for artist to keep the ink more shallow in the dermis where it can hold its shape and location. it also has a lot to do with sun exposure. keep a physical sunblock on it, and it'll age a lot better. tldr it'll fade but not as badly as old sailor tattoos."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,it is a fact hat colors fade faster than black ink. but yes like you said everyone's skin is different and it will hold longer in some. also the people who told you not to get color are dumb. unless you have a certain skin typepigment and your artist should be able to notice this then that fading won't happen for decades of the tattoo is applied properly.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,that's not true. it's not opinion but fact that black ink stays better over time. initially it appears to fade because while it heals the irritation making it look darker goes away. over an extended period of time color certainly fades more than black.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,with improved application comes improved longevity. tattoos will appear more aged when applied poorly and appear more fresh when properly applied. some men in their 70s 80s i know still have good looking tattoos because they were applied properly.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"i forgot to mention that i'm a vampire... i'm not talking about my skin, i'm talking about the tattoo. when i was a kid, my 35 year old uncle had an eagle tattoo that was just a green blob on his arm. i know many older people who had tattoos that looked like this. his skin wasn't wrinkly, it was just the tattoos weren't done with the same level of detail and they didn't have the coloring techniques commonly used today. of course when i'm 80 my skin is going to be wrinkly. i'm talking about when i'm 50. i was referring to grandpa meaning time period it was done, not his current age."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"sure, if i had some tribal tattoo, i wouldn't worry too much. if it's one color with solid filling, it won't change a lot. people with new tattoos worry about little things sometimes. as long as it's nothing too serious, a touch up can fix most problems except for somebody i know who got text on their ribs with a typo and no room to edit it but yeah, they're expensive so you wanna take care of them as much as possible. i only had to get one of my tattoos touched up, and that was because it didn't heal properly, which was totally my fault. i was drunk and i fell asleep and it got stuck to my shirt overnight. it looks fine now thankfully."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-08,"you can keep it looking nice to a certain extent but imagine a drawing and then tracing over the lines again and again. you will probably end up muddying it more by constantly trying to keep it fresh than if you just get it, let it heal, hit up any spots that faded more than usual and then stick with things like taking care of your skin, staying out of the sun, etc. it's never going to look and stay like it does the day you get it done but that doesn't mean you can't keep it looking nice."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-10-09,you're saying something as a matter of fact when it's absolutely untrue. you said ink is ink as of it was true and it isn't. if you had any sort of experience you'd know that. but you went out of your way to try to present it as fact even when you actually have no idea.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-18,this could be an interesting game mechanic that would have added a lot to that game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,first time i read the title as limbo with a fleshlight...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"ok, now someone do limbo with a fleshlight. how does that change the gameplay? lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,interesting as fuck.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"is it referring to limbo, the first circle of hell?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,this is actually a pretty interesting concept. i'm imagining how the this would change the gameplay.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,now i wonder how that spider looks like.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-20,this is terrifying
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,read it as limbo with a fleshlight. my god what is wrong with me.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"the art, music, and overall atmosphere of this game were impressive, but it was unfortunately ruined by the unintuitive and unresponsive controls, to the point of being unplayable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"this one has a deep message in it though. when a black person gets enlightened, they become white. hence the black community hates educated black people. the people here are really against racism unlike 9gaggers, i now know how to function in this community"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"it would be interesting to take this idea in a different direction. when i first saw the gif i assumed it was a metaphor for depression or mental issues. the kid was at a birthday party but in his world it was dark and terrifying. definitely a bit more sad but a really interesting concept if you played through the game. limbo has always been a game that left you searching for a deeper meaning, which was very much intentional the developers at playdead studios have gone on record saying there is no official meaningto limbo or its ending, making it ripe for personal speculation. the only sanctioned story is unsure of his sisters fate, a boy enters the unknown. i think it would be cool to see a video that played with the idea that it was a kid trapped inside of his own mind."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,thank you the video has no point without the twist.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,no wonder it was so familiar. i knew i've seen it before. dorkly makes some good shit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"i like that idea, and it might make a neat game ,where things seem terrifying until you see them fully."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,have you tried little nightmares yet?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,i recently replayed inside. i knew the parts with the creepy water child were coming but sure as shit i freaked out when they showed up.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,have fun explaining the ending of inside to your son... lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,they just released inside. give them a year or two
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,little nightmares almost feels like a sequel in many ways.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"limbo is tremendous fun, i only just finished it doing a lp for my channel this week and what was supposed to be 'oh i'll just do 5 minutes a day' ended up filming the entire thing in one sitting. seriously one of my favourite platformers i've played."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,insides ending had me laughing so hard. never felt so amazing playing a video game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,you should check little nightmare. the game is short but very nice.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"they are making another one. they haven't announced any details, but they are working on it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,that game was so interesting
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,originally it was launched on consoles like xbox and playstation. around the same time as super meat boy. translating the controls to a smart phone or tablet can understandably be sometimes difficult as seeing the entire screen is pretty necessary for 99 of the game and quick precise actions can do a lot to ensure your success.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"i originally played limbo on an ipad. the controls worked just fine for me, though the later platforming segments are a lot harder and require precision which the controls didn't help. for the most part, though, it was fine and precise enough to play through and enjoy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-18,the controls are fine on ps4.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"you're a redditor, harry!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"except... i think it would have been better if things weren't all rainbows and blowjobs when lit up. more like... death, rot, and satan."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"well, that's one extra way to deal with the spider legs."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,limbo is a critically acclaimed indy game that came out a few years back.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,well gaming on a device made for gaming has its perks mate. stop gaming on a phone or tablet and stuff like that will be a complaint of the past.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,lol yeah you gotta play it right. i played it on 360 only demo and immediately after had to buy the full game. lucky for me they gave it out for free and i had none of those issues.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,your honestly really stupid
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,lol i think it has something to do with how we perceive the world. i haven't played the game in a while.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,i've never seen it before
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,first time i'm seeing it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,there is a game sort of plays with this concept about a blind girl who sees the world by listening to the sounds around her and getting close enough to touch things. you hear things like cloth flapping in the wind and she'll think it's clothes on a line then get closer and realize it's a scarecrow. that sort of thing. it's called beyond eyes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"i think it would be cool to see a video that played with the idea that it was a kid trapped inside of his own mind. there's a short horror game called among the sleephttpwww.krillbite.comats, which is about a 2yearold. it's not quite trapped inside his mind, but about how things look different to a child. i'm also reminded of an old pointandclick game called sanitariumhttpswww.gog.comgamesanitarium, which is about an adult man."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"trapped inside his own mind? why, that's alan wake!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,have you ever heard the story of our lord and savior the binding of isaac?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,you would enjoy psychonauts.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,when i played it i thought he fell out of his tree house and died and his spirit had to reach his sister because he wanted to see if she was ok. then he realized he was dead when he reached her because she doesn't acknowledge you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,this reminds me of the lore of five nights at freddy's. i haven't followed it in a very long time because the fandom got out of control but i believe the whole story is told from the point of view of a child who got bit by a malfunctioning animatronic at his birthday party.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,a kid trapped inside of his own mind isn't that what adventure time could be?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,this is what english teachers look for.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"the developers at playdead studios have gone on record saying there is no official meaningto limbo or its ending, making it ripe for personal speculation doesn't that just mean it's pointless to speculate since there was no intended meaning to it?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,have you played limbo?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"imo your comment should be marked as a spoiler, because i wanted to play limbo but after reading what limbo developers said about the ending i don't want to waste my time"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,st elsewhere. interesting fan theory around that  due to the implications of the crossover between that show and others characters from elsewhere appear on other shows and vice versa there's an interesting map that shows how that one ending basically indicates that nearly all of the history of tv occurs in the mind of an autistic child.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,st. elsewhere.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,st. elsewhere
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"er, i seem to have upset you. i shouldn't have discredited the video, it was entertaining. limbo has always been a game that left you searching for a deeper meaning, which was very much intentional  the developers at playdead studios have gone on record saying there is no official meaningto limbo or its ending, making it ripe for personal speculation. the only sanctioned story is unsure of his sisters fate, a boy enters the unknown. i think it would be cool to see a video that played with the idea that it was a kid trapped inside of his own mind."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"i'm not upset, sorry if i came off that way. i'm just confused why you think that taking a video in a different direction than you expected is a missed opportunity."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"nah, it was a simple misunderstanding where both commenters sorted it out in a refreshingly friendly way on the internet above."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,haha yea. i think i was mostly a demoman main back then. although i played a lot of the classes all the time. never really had a main
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,i'm up to 37 and it sucks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"so true. you believe you're being put through the ringer on those levels too. but to be fair, you are still getting to grips with the controls  game mechanics at that point. i'm only in on level 40ish so still wondering if there's a final boss. no spoilers please."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"when your controller is bigger than the device you're trying to run the game on, you know you're doing something silly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"one thing to keep in mind, a lot of controllers have some odd mapping since there's no kl file included. every xbox derived controller i've personally tried has dropped to generic.kl and the mapping was really weird, right stick mapped to the triggers for instance. only one that had one was the first party 360 controller, which i don't have to test. very easy fix if you're rooted though"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"i think that's exactly what i mean. i'm seeing that that show was back in '96 though, so the statute of limitations on spoilers has long long been up on that show too."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"if you play properly, once you hit a certain level bracket, it reverts back to 118 difficulty, but you retain any perks you've gained. problem is, that bracket keeps moving. and you have to play in a certain manner. i, for example, have most been goofing off, so i'm kinda screwed later on."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"buckle up and i'll explain what sister location, fnaf world, and the book brought to the table. this is from years of following the series passively, game theory's newer videos, and the fnaf subreddit being on my feed. the book introduced the two inventors and founders to freddy fazbear's,ffp one of whom is the purple guy, william afton. now this fucker has a thing for killer robots, and he's been killing kids with robots since day 1 of ffp's existence, maybe even before, but we aren't sure of that. now he had two kids, a son and a daughter. oh yea, should establish that fnaf 4's locations are right above the sister location building which is a secret underground research lab for building and testing the new robots now the events of the fnaf4 minigames happened and all, and the son got bit, and eventually died. the ending where the kid is told i will put you back together is actually hearing it from purple guy, his father. his father always knew that his killer robots would get haunted and start killing on their own, however this time he wanted to do it on purpose. so he used sister location to build new robots that would kill children specifically so they would get haunted, in some sick effort to bring his son back to life. however his dumbass daughter goes up to one of the robots, baby, and gets slaughtered even though she was told not to approach the fucking robot.don't get in the fucking robot shinji which causes purple guy to follow through the events of sister location, and be manipulated by the robots to help them escape the building. how do robots escape a building to be set loose on the world you may ask. well strap in because we're getting more wild. there's this thing called the scooper, which rips out the internals of the robots, and after the protagonist scoops all the robots, an amalgam robot named ennard literally their innards is born, and manipulates the player up to the scooper, which rips out all his organs and ennard climbs in and uses his body as a gross rotting skin suit, from which they commit more murders cause that's what they're programmed to do and springtrap is actually ennard inside purple guy's corpse, which makes for a nice bit of irony that they got stuck in a damn robot again oh and the other founder of ffp was murdered by the robot baby as well"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"yeah it's not the most elegant way to do it, but for people who just want to play some snes or n64 or even wii if you have a higher end android phone on the trainbusairplane it's a pretty good setup. the dock itself is pretty cheap too. you can get them for like 1520 on ebay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"impressive writeup. sorry if i was coming off as a dick you clearly have a lot more knowledge about this than i. definitely is more complicated than i thought, but i was able to follow most of your synopsis. thank you for taking the time to write that. it definitely threw me off when you mentioned fetishes but i can see where you're coming from, maybe hobbyist would've been a better word though haha"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,fetish was mainly just a joke tbh oh and fnaf4 being a nightmare actually makes more sense when you find out in sister location that the house's gas was being controlled to cause the kid to have delusions.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-05-19,"yeah that would be pretty awesome. i'd even settle for a phone case with actually usable buttons. i'm not sure how you would design one to have the buttons on the front without covering the display, but surely there's a way to do it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"seeing as there are a lot of questions i'm going to clarify a few things  the bundle games all come in one steam key so  sword  sworcery, limbo, amnesia, and psychonauts are all included in that one key. if you own any of these games on steam already activating the bundle key will not give you giftable copies of those games. so those asking for people to gift you individual games your out of luck. for the extra game  bastion  it has its own steam key but be aware that in the past when they have added more games for paying above the average after the fact they tied it to the already existing extras key. so giving away bastion at this time might screw you out of getting extras that they may add in the future. that said if you want to gift it to someone dont redeem the code it wont expire and wait till the bundle is over to know if its safe to give away. also you have to pay more than 1 to get the steam keys for the games."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"did anyone else not receive the email from humble indie bundle after paying? i'm freakin' out, man."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,the video on this one is even better than usual. do all yourselves a favor and go watch it. having the narrator from bastion doing it is awesome and gave me chills.spoiler
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i have literally already bought every one of these five games and two of the five soundtracks and i'm still buying this bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,anyone know why the icon is botanicula? i can only assume that one will be unlocked soon.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"also, all of those games are mac compatible, i believe."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,you'd be psychonaut to grab this right now.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,now this is good marketing. getting people to pay whatever they want for a game is better than people not knowing about it at all.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this bundle is sooooo good. i bought it despite already owning 4 out of 5 games. so good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this is a retardedly good amount of value
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"yup. the best humble bundle ever would have 45 games i already own. oh well, take my money anyways."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,limbo run under wine and won't start for me... any other suprises...? sword and sworcery works bad with two screen... can't chose another resolution and not fullscreen. but that can be easily fixed in the config.txt at least.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"they lied about crossplatform  the linux port of limbo is just the windows game wrapped in wine. disappointing. on the other hand, bastion comes with a snazzy installer that can magically put together a package for any distribution. very neat."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"oh, my, god. buy i've wanted limbo and bastion forever, but i kept putting off buying them from the xbl arcade. and i've heard psychonauts is great. so. buying. right. now. wheres. my. credit. card."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i bought it and realized i didn't pay the more than average price. so i bought it again for the more than average price. i have no qualms spending 13 dollars on these games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"this seriously one of the most awesome things ever. it's like the orange box, but cheaper!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,can i buy this and give each game away to a different person? not a pc gamer but have friends that are.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i almost soiled myself until i realized i own a copy of limbo and bastion on xbla and psychonauts and amnesia on pc. i really want superbrothers though, is it worth the price of the bundle?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"wow, this is an amazing bundle! and i only have one of the games! i've already just bought it, but do these activate on steam?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"darn, was only looking forward to bastion and it just had to be beat the average  prized."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"so, i'm currently building a pc and ran into a snag with money moving costs. if i pay for this now, can i downloaduse the games later and on a different machine? i have no idea how the humble bundles work."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i'm glad they give me a choice on how much i'll pay to shit in my own pants from fear with amnesia. underwear is expensive.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i just bought limbo when it was on the steam sale. not a tad bit upset either and i already own bastion  fantastic game. it helps good devs, good charities, and a good site. going to give away the bastion key"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,humblebundle my ass. this should be renamed to holyshitfuckawesomebundle. time to shit myself in fear tonight playing amnesia again!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i've been wanting to play psychonauts for a while, it's a shame i could only pay 50 cents, paypal only had 77 cents in it, wish i could have paid more."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,wow this is great. just purchased my first humble bundle because of it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"hope someone will read this. i just bought the bundle for above average just for bastions soundtrack, now where do i find the soundtracks?? thanks edit found it! just click your download link and select soundtrack where it is set to windows."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,how much do you guys think this is worth? i'm really considering buying it and probably spending about 1015 bucks on it. i mean hey it's charity and some really good games is 15 bucks a good amount?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"hey, i usually have bought the bundles in the late stages, and a lot of the time they add new games and stuff in part way through. so my question is, if you buy the bundle early on, and later they add more stuff, do you still get the new stuff? thanks."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"you sir, are a legend."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,this is some good shit! i might have to buy it even though i've already got all the games except bastion.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"why does humble bundle not send me the emails about this, i have bought 4 of them so far, with my email in it. oh well reddit is here to save the day d thank you!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i own all of these except for amnesia, but i bought this for the bastion soundtrack aside from anything else. so uhh.. do i click to download bastion and download the whole thing to get the soundtrack or what?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,sorry for being a noob but do i need steam to play some of these? because when i try to start limbo it crashes always right after i start it

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"even though i don't have time to game anymore, i still donated one my last dollars. i guess i'll drop the soundtracks on my ipod for my morning commute."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"the only way this deal could get any more awesome, is if they add hib 4. i bought the bundle last night at  10. even though i beat the average, i felt like i robbed them, so i ended up buying two more copies to give away to friends"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"anybody else buy it, then get a blank screen for psychonauts?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"they need to change the name, this is not a humble bundle. the majestic indie bundle perhaps?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,humble bundle making indie royale look like an incredible ripoff since 2010
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i bought it but it won't give me my key! resender won't either. gahhh i want to play.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i had everything but superbrothers. i can at least give bastion to my wife since it is a separate key, but it's too bad i didn't get giftable copies of the other games. oh well, still worth the cash just for the soundtracks and to help hb out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i already own limbo, bastion, and amnesia... bought it anyway."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"wait, is this for na only? or can i change into euros somehow?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i hope the games they add a few days into this are just as good, if they keep up that amazing tradition that is."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i have a question about paypal, i have an old account with 8 bucks, but paypal doesn't let me buy the bundle, or anything else, unless i tie a new credit card to the account because my old cc is dead and i don't have another one. they fucked me with that money, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i already have psychonauts, i bought limbo yesterday, and i have bastion on xbox... and it's not nearly enough reasons to not get this!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"why wasn't this earlier. still though, the soundtracks are great!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i just had the greatest deal of my life and nobody will know of it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,omg omg omg omg! bastion has been tempting me with its sexiness on my steam wish list... and who can forget psychonauts? best bundle ever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"wow, payed 30 and didn't even get the code, hope that goes to a good cause..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"is there anyway to get it to convert into gbp? im broke at the moment and need to spend as little as possible typical, bundle ends 2 days before pay day and knowing how much exactly to get bastion would be useful"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"awesome, altough getting a key is a little slow, but it is worth the wait"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"damn, quarter mil already. take that, doubters."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,what are the chances hib4 will be included as a bonus eventually ? i'd love to grab both in one go.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this is the best bundle ever. just popped down 50 for this. such a good cause as well!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"every last one of these games is well worth it. if you or someone you know doesn't have at least bastion or psychonauts, you need to give them this pack. now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"this is the perfect bundle. it comes out right as i  by coincidence  am about to buy limbo and bastion. my only regret is i already have and have finished amnesia. i'll be forcing all my friends to play it, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,annnnnnd bought. i'm hoping that super brothers is fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,wow this is amazing. i was hoping bastion would be in one soon. i wouldn't have expected amnesia and limbo in there too though.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i wish that the steam keys would give you extra copies of the games you already own. it is kind of lame that you can't trade off the duplicates.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"damn, this is such an awesome bundle. if i hadn't just paid everything i had to fix the stupid car i'd be buying it right now  well i have two weeks, right?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"think these would run on my lenovo x220? none of them seem incredibly demanding, computerwise, but i'm a dumb console guy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,only games that looked worth it in this bundle were limbo and maybe bastion. i'm going to wait until they add more games like they do most of the time.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"question would it be frowned upon if i paid little for this bundle but more for the next one? i'm strapped for cash right now, but i really don't wanna pass this up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,should i have gotten an email right away with the games in it once i donated? cause its taking a while to show up. maybe im just too impatient.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,amnesia is now on my steam list.. i am going to preapologise to my drunk self.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i've never bought a humble bundle, is it possible to splitgift the games? basically i own limbo, amnesia and bastion while my boyfriend owns psychonauts and superbrothers. it'd be nice if we could get one bundle and each get the games we don't already have."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,an amazing bundle! luckily i don't have any of these games yet.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,do i want to play amnesia? i've seen what it does to people... and i've played a bit of penumbra...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i have not played a single one of these. consider this sold
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,can i buy it and not get amnesia? i feel creeped out even downloading it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i would pay 10 dollars just for the bastion soundtrack.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i already have most of these on separate systems, but now they will all be unified holy crap it include the soundtracks!!!!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this is a hell of a good deal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i already own one of the games. is there a way to just gift that specific one through steam when i buy the whole bundle?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,some great games there. some will probably be surprised by how awesome superbrothers is. a beautiful game that deserves as much praise as the other games listed!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,yet again does not having a job or money screw me d. worst is i only have superbrothers on my iphone parents pay for it but not video games and none of the others. oh well on the bright side i'm graduating from high school on sunday and i can find a job hopefully soon.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,is limbo worth the buy? i've been looking at it for a while now.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,anyone can tell me how long this is going for? i'm on a trip away from my computer until monday night

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i'm really hoping they add more games as time goes on. they usually do, and i love it. i guess i'm just greedy though. d already a fantastic bundle!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i have been meaning to get a hold of limbo, holy fuck i'm down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i told my little brother if he gets good grades i will purchase him this bundle since he's been a lazy little prick in school recently. definitely some of the best games i've seen in the bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,was gonna buy all these but the sword one. back around christmas time. so glad i decided to wait!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"best humble bundle ever, by far. too bad i own everything in it already. actually, on second thought that's great because i'm flat broke right now and would feel awful if i missed out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i'm getting this just for the bastion flac soundtrack.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,can't i get this for free technically?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,why don't they include the payment option paysafecard? i see these awesome bundles and i'd love to play these games. but there is no way for me to give them my money!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this will probably get buried and sound like a rookie question but can i purchase this on my laptop and then transfer the games to another computer in the near future?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i've never played any of these except on my friend's computer because i have a mac...i love all of them...damn you mac!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i'm seeing that a lot of people already have most of these games. we need to start a new thread where we can hook people without money up with people who want to buy the above average bundle for someone.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i just got the email and first thing i did after making my purchase was to run over here to make this post and apparently i am a bit late.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"how long is this deal going on,  how would i keep track of my games?? i am without a computer right now  would have to download this to my brother's desktop. i just wanna own pyschonauts, bastion, amnesia  limbo on pc for when i finally get a desktop."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,stupid question since i am out of the loop can i still get previous humble bundles?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i've bought it, downloaded limbo, but it won't start up. this application has failed to start because d3dx942.dll was not found. reinstalling he application may fix this problem. help?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"these are all games that i actually want, except for amnesia. only because i already own it. above average instabuy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,jumping on this for the soundtracks alone! best bundle ever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i hope someone's going to read this. i have a crappy laptop intel i3, no graphics card. would i be able to run any of these games decently without having fps issues?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"dumb question, but how do you get the soundtracks? i have them all activated on steam but can't find the soundtracks?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,how long is it taking you guys to get your emails?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i saw all the games and thought shoot, this looks pretty good. and then i heard the trailer music for sword and sworcery and said hot damn ok i'm buying this half for the soundtracks."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i had none of these games, and it is already a well spent 7 dollars if were going for it we also want bastion ofcourse"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this looks like the first humble bundle i will buy. very nice!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"man, i really picked the wrong time to be poor."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bought for 8 because heard good things about all of them!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"one option is windows. could i play these on my 360? i have a mac, but i would prefer to play on the 360. sorry if this is a silly question."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,awesome! i just bought mine d
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,since i already purchased bastion on steam i'd like to give my extra key away. first person to message me gets it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"you'd be a total retard not to buy this. limbo and amnesia both own, you may like bastion, psychonauts is old school fun and superbrothers is worth it just for the music."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,amnesia doesn't want to work on my pc
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,but...but...i already own them all! what am i supposed to do now??
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i already had amnesia but the rest where a steal for 8
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,not that i would do this but can you pay nothing and get the bundle for free?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"hey guys, is it possible to do this from europe? i'm just not sure how this would work currencywise. oh and i have paypal by the way"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,thank you for this! purchased this bundle and looking forward to more.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"awesome. i remember psychonauts from the console version. however, i never beat it and own exactly none of these games. will be buying this bundle when i get home. so thanks for posting this."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bought it without question! such a good bundle!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bought the bundle for a small amount because i didn't really want bastion....then i gave in and bought the bundle again for bastion and gave the left over steam code to my friend for the extra games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"as someone who was a big fan of the humble bundle's for android, i'm sad to see this one isn't on mobile at all. wasn't that the direction they were heading in? either way, i'm not gonna buy this one because i don't have the time to play these games on pc. i know i'm in the minority here, but i prefer to play games when in transit, and i'll definitely pay above average for the next bundle that comes to android."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"seeing as how i own psychonauts, limbo, amnesia and bastion i won't be participating in this one. however. if you don't own any of these, you are a fucking moron not to get in on this. these games are all fantastic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,it's just amazing watching the numbers climb like that...

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"nice, haven't played these besides amnesia and a little of superbrothers on my phone. can someone tell me what that other newer side scrolling game is? looks like limbo a little except you build fires, kill monsters, etc. i remember seeing it a while ago, the second version of it i believe. seeing these indie games reminds me i want to get it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"the bastion soundtrack is worth all the money in my whole bank account, this is easily worth the 15 i paid!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,the bastion soundtrack is amazing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i already have limbo and bastion but this is still the best indie bundle ever. i also wish i could have paid a lot more for than i have. the average windows price always makes me sad.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"noob here, i bout the pack for all the games sep limbo, i already have it. my friend said he would take it and i am not sure how to go about giving it to him. this is my first bundle thing and need help please and thank you."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i've got all of these, so i'm buying them for my friend i've been bugging to play these."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,crap! so bastion is really that good of a game? i should have shelled out the extra bucks to get it

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i'm genuinely excited to finally play amnesia the rest of the pack is really just icing on the cake. people have built it up as the be all end all of 'constipation relief' and i'm finally going to see if it lives up to it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"didn't radiohead already discover that this was not a successful way to make money when they released in rainbows? i remember that you pay what you wanted to for it, but that kol was not done in that fashion. that led me to assume they found it wasn't profitable enough. regardless, very cool package and concept, i hope it does well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"how do i access the sound tracks? within a few minutes of playing bastion, i've found that i am already in love with the music."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,noob question once i've bought the games will they be unlocked on steam or will they be directly downloaded to my computer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"quick question for everyone, i unlocked the games on steam, and was wondering where does that put the soundtrack files? i can't seem to find them. edit i'm dumb, figured it out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i'd buy the shit out this if i didn't already own each game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"holy shit, this is so awesome. i am only a german student with not so much money left on the bank, and one week ago i spent 15 on kickstarter for carmageddon reincarnation. so i only got a few bucks left, but spent 5 now on this package. then i saw i just had to pay 2,5 more to get that bastion game... when i now want that game, can i boost my order by 5 more , and then get a new key for bastion. or do i have to make a whole new purchase with more than 7,50? edit boosting the purchase is working. i got my bastion steam key.  when new money is coming, i will get another keys for a friend of mine who doesn't have a credit card and can't purchase any of these games. so i will make a little surprise for him.  last steam sale i bought him gta 4, and he liked it. hope he will like this too."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bastion looks fun... heard many a good thing about it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i want these so bad but my computer is too shitty to even handle playing a streaming video, it already overheated twice today and i just had to uninstall steam. and then there's the fact that i'm too poor to even pay rent right now. whyyyy? this is freaking awesome and i've never played any of these."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"god, and i just spent 3 on limbo. i could have gotten 4 more games for the same price!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i am so impressed by this bundle. and the soundtrack to bastion... god. so good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,does anyone else find it ridiculous that the bundle hasn't even been up for 24 hours and it's already approaching 1 million dollars in total payments?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"is there an indie bundle subreddit yet? i know there's an indie games one, but i feel that with all the different bundles available these days gala, humble, royale... having one central place to get updates would be way awesome."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"any way to pay with gbp, or is it usd only?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i just bought this but limbo isn't working for me. it says this application has failed to start because d3dx942.dll was not found. reinstalling the application may fix this problem. i have reinstalled it a few times and get the same thing every time. anyone know what i should do?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i own all but sword and sorcery but had to give them some money just out of curiosity to hear what the amnesia soundtrack has on it just because the idea of driving along with the music from that game playing makes me smile. edit holy crap just started listening to it and my god, the song lux tenebras is epic as hell! don't remember it from the game, but oh my word what an awesome song."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"can't decide, what should i play first!?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i have no money but would love to help charity. btw never played one of those games i played amnesia. limbo looks interesting. fuck my life
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this is available for ubuntu as well

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,so what's reddit's opinion on how much people should pay for this bundle? you are allowed to pay just 1 cent and get 4 games. where is the line between being a cheapskate and just taking advantage of the deal?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i would have never known about this otherwise! thank you so much! already purchased and am so excited!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,so many great games for my shelf.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"well bastion won't even open for me, it just says there was a problem and is now closing. installed twice, redownloaded installed uninstalled, everything. fml."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i only have 5 dollars ready. that's not fair. i'll need 10 more dollars for me to feel like i didn't just rape their games for pricing
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i bought this awesome bundle, only to come to the conclusion that my crappy laptop can't play psychonauts or amnesia. time to start saving up for a desktop lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"awesome just bought 2 games that ive already played! xd nah just kidding i am happy to have a second copy of bastion and limbo on my computer, itl be nice if i ever have the urge to play on the go and have my laptop with me. plus all the other games look great, cant wait to get to psychonauts"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,is it possible to get these on steam in such a way that i can get the two i don't have and give the rest to my friends?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"beat psychonauts twice and amnesia. yep, buying it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"at the risk of sounding really dumb, some questions i only have limbo and for ps3, so i figure this will be worth the money. is bastion really that good? and will my poopoo pc be able to handle bastion and amnesia?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"great bundle, i would recommend at least paying 20 dollars for this bundle"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i paid just enough to get bastion added on, not sure if i'll ever have enough time to play any of them through, but if i do and like them i can always buy another set as a gift if i feel i ripped them off. the flexible pay thing is a neat idea."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,just got mine! so haaaapppppyyyyy!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this just made my birthday

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i feel like i just won the lottery! i have been within half a click of buying each of these games individually especially bastion and ss ep, but before today, i held out. i was able to get them to day as a bundle. brilliant"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i wish they'd get new games! limbo, amensia, and superbrothers have all for sure been in previous bundles. i think bastion was too, but i can't remember."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i have bought every humble bundle yet the ones that aren't numbered don't count, and i think i'm most excited for this one. i already had psychonauts, but amnesia and limbo were on my wishlist."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i'm pretty much buying these bundles for the soundtracks at this point.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"well...i don't have bastion, amnesia, superbrothers, and i've just got the other two on xbox...but i'm still thinking of getting the bundle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i love these guys. i think i'll be purchasing every single one of them from now on if they offer the value that this does.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,what? games my pc can actually handle????? i'm in heaven.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"awesome! already have bastion, so i unfortunately will be a cheapskate, but if i didn't i'd pay even more just to get bastion, such a wonderful game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,can i add these games to steam? will the keys work there?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"worth it just for bastion, that game is amazing"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i can't remember if i've played amnesia before. but i'm definitely buying this bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,if you donated 1 million i figure you'd bump the average donation up to around 60 and push the bastion unlock out of reach for most people.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i'm sure this has been said elsewhere here, but i just noticed that if you mouse over the pie chart, it turns greyscale for the colorblind. these folks are fantastic. mind  blown."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,never bought or played an indie game before this. where has this been all my life? cue music turn around.....
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,its been 5 hrs and i never got an email from them... only an amazon email saying the payment had been made.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i know it is a bit early for this, but sometimes people manage to find out if there is a bonus game that will come out later for the bundle. anyone have a scoop on what this might be is there is a bonus game coming?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"best 20 bucks ever spent. at last, psychonauts here i come."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,this is the way of the future
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"is there a way to participate in this event without a credit card? i don't have a creditdebit card, so is there a way to purchase with cash?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i had none of these games, but wanted all of them pretty bad. this is an amazing deal, and i had no problem whatsoever chipping into some of my paypal savings"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,bought one for the girlfriend and myself. this is one good bundle!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"what split do most people do for their donation? i want to throw in 10, but i'm not sure if i should take away from the charity to give more to the developershumble bundle, or if that'd be considered a dick thing to do."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i'm so excited for this! i only owned amnesia prior to this. money well spent! waiting for my purchase email!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"are the keys sent instantly to our emails? i've never done this before, but i checked out with google checkout and i didn't get any messages from humble bundle... i don't want to bother their tech support if i don't have to. anyone know?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"being my first time buying a humble bundle, i accedentally bought it twice, i promptly became ggg and gave the extra to my friend"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,brb crying because my computer sucks too much to play games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,that's a freaking awesome bundle!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"damn, best bundle so far.too bad paypal limited me, so this is the first bundle i won't buy"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"please don't downvote me into oblivion for being computer challenged, but i've never used bittorrent to download anything, and it's recommended for the larger files. when i click to download it just says i've downloaded psychonauts release.zip.torrent and i'm not sure what to do, could someone help me out? please? i've always wanted to play this game and finally get the chance, but i'm not sure how to access it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"this is the first indie bundle i've bought, newish to steam, these games look like a ton of fun!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,bastion just crashes with a generic failed to load message when i run it in xp. reinstalling didn't fix it. any ideas?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"dangit, i already have bastion and psychonauts. what i don't have is a penny in my bank account for the other ones"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"my daily obsession being on halt, i was really glad for this. bastion tied me over the entire day, and now i'm ready to go back. thanks."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,crap! had already bought bastion and sword  sworcery! will probably grab the bundle anyway
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i already own psychonauts through gog and i'll probably never have the courage to play amnesia, but i consider it to be 10 well spent."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"wow, def buying just for limbo. it looks sweet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,of course they release this awesome bundle when i literally have no extra money. time to trade in some coins.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i already bought half of these games during steam sales, but fuck it i love giving this charity my money."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i feel super bad for only giving a dollar wanted bastion too  but i had to borrow 0.76 just to give a dollar.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,first one in a while that i am buying. got a lot of good games in it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i was biding my time for a steam deal on bastion, but this is much better! thank you humble bundle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i was really excited about this, but i just paid over the average and haven't received a key or any means to download the games. i have a receipt from paypal with my transaction id, and tried the key resender, but still got nothing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,how much do u need to pay to unlock bastion? it says 7.49 on average but is it based on the 5 games or the 12 things youll be paying for?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i will pay a whole strawpenny, and not a cent more!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"twenty bucks well spent. also, did someone really donate 3000 bucks or just a weird odd thing?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,first time i buy the humble bundle and its amazing especially for the bastion soundtrack.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,this is the first humble bundle since i put together my new gaming pc. i had to check it out because i had heard of these in the past. glad i did. i really love what these people are doing.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"so poor right now, paid what i could, sad that i couldn't give them more, especially for bastion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,just the other day i was thinking of playing amnesia...then i was like oh 15 for amnesia and it goes to charity neato...now..until i realized that it's all these games for 15....holy flippin dolphins batman!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"hmm, didn't expect to be buying psychonauts again. i think i'm about five copies deep on that one"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"really wish i could chip in more 10... hate not being able to work... but, i do thank them a lot and hope i can give more next go around!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,have all these already. even psychonauts for the xbox. this will make a nice gift for my new to pc gaming friend.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"as someone that finished amnesia and enjoyed every immersive second of it, it makes me sad that many redditors have the game on their libraries and havent played past the water level. i dont get why people dont play it, being scared shitless is part of the fun"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i know my comment probably isn't going to be read by many people, but i just want to say thank you. the developers deserve much more money than they are getting, and it's always good to donate."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"this is greater than diablo 3 launch. well, at least it is smoother and can be played offline"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i'm happy about this pay as much as you would like deal. i wanted to pay 25, but i only had 13.83. got 10 cents left hooray! will be using this service much more often!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,this is a great bundle but i have to wonder what they'll add to sweeten the pot during the last weekas they usually do since the soundtracks are already included. willcan they make it better?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,10 win
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i bought one on amazon and have only received two transaction id's that do not work on steam and no link for downloading... can anyone help me out please.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"dang, i wish i could donate with steam wallet money  i have a little over 5 left in my steam wallet and that would be the only way i could donate. really wish i could play these games!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i feel like a jerk for only spending 8 bucks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"jobless, near broke, and still purchasing this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i know this will be buried but figure it's worth asking. i'd like to give my friends a gift and these games would be perfect. is there any way i can send a game individually to a friend and send another game individually to a different friend? thanks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"it might just be my cynicism, but this seems way too exploitable..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"the only one i didn't recognize was superbrothers, and after looking it up it turns out it's that one game with the incredible art that i've been wanting to play forever, i.e. a perfect fit with the other games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,how much in total do u need to pay to unlock bastion?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i'm going to pay cause i may have pirated amnesia for free... feels bad bro.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,now you're making me feel bad for not being able to pay for the whole deal. is bastion really worth it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"as good a deal as it is, i thought it was kinda scumbaggy for the humblebundle or whatever it was, clearly linked to this to have bought it for 3000 and thus driving up the average."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"downloading now. mainly for amnesia, after all i've heard about it on here. also been meaning to check out psychonauts for ages, so that's a nice bonus."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,'pay what you want' can't pay soo much
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"first time buying from humble bundle. if i buy this for myself will the games be added to my account immediately or will it show up on my inventory? if i use the gift option and gift it to myself will it show up in my inventory? reason i'm asking is because i want to give this to a friend, but his birthday isn't for a couple of months and i don't feel very secure having the link go unclaimed for that time period."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"how do i buy it without registering for any of the three services mentioned below the bundle? i hate giving my email address out to the tricksters like paypal. i just want to put my card details and off i go... to play amnesia. don't get me wrong, i know that my card details are more important than my email address, but i just don't feel like creating yetanotherinternetaccount for something that i may use only once in my lifetime."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-03,if anyone is unsure about getting the bundle... i'm streaming bastionhttpwww.twitch.tvshowthelove. this game alone is worth it. i've already played through limbo and thought it was amazing as well. i'll probably stream bastion for an hour or two. edit  done for now.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,could anyone recommend an order in which to play these? just bought the bundle but had none of the games previously. i guess it'd be best to start with the shortest... any tips?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,my fucking god. best humble bundle evore!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,holy shit ! i need this !
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i wish i had the moneyits unfair to pay under 20 for all that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,seriously considering overdrawing my account to get this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,great time to not have a credit card i can use. at least i can continue avoiding amnesia.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"bought the bundle. got the order receipt from google checkout, and that's it. how do i get the games now?  help pls."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,1 cent well spent.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i wish i had a credit card.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,..anyone have extra codes?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,well worth the penny! thanks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,is anyone willing to buy me a 1 copy of the bundle? never got a chance to play psychonauts nor amnesia and i've heard great things about both.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"why is the thumbnail on the reddit link the little guy from botanicula? is that game going to be added to the bundle later, y'think?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,anybody else think the default controls on most of the games are pretty awful?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,awesome deal but wait before you buy they add more games and more extras as time goes by. so wait until the last minute to get the most games and bonus for your buck!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,bought it just for amnesia lol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"holy fuck, if i had a hundred bucks i'd buy the shit out of this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"you windows users are cheap, haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,god i'd like to have that bundle
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"great, i paid 25 and got nothing for it. they never sent me an email with the key and their automatic support system didn't resolve the problem. do not get swindled as i have."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,if you have no one to give it as a gift search no more! seriously though... i'll only get my payment after the expiration date...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"long time lurker, but this is such and awesome bundle i actually had to register and say wow! wish i could afford to pay enough to get bastion, but getting everything else, on steam, for 1 is mind blowing. thanks for sharing!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i just put in the steam code for bastion and both bastion and worms reloaded  2d showed up in my library. huh.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"you know what? i only paid 1 for this bundle, and not one single fuck of mine was given. on a related note, does anyone want to further perpetuate my behavior and give me a key for bastion?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"pffft i wouldn't even download those games from tpb, won't even to think about paying for then."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"once again linux users pay several dollars more on average than windows or mac users. i hate to feel selfrighteous, but this just proves how awesome us geeks are."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,so pay what you like means i actually have to pay something? my reactionhttpwww.youtube.comwatch?vm5qgkogzubq to the tpb!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,this is seriously one of the best humble bundles i've seen yet.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,play psychonauts first. classic game nobody played from the xbox days. i even used a controller to simulate the experience
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"you are a very lucky man. all four are great. well three of them are great, and one of them i actually can't play because i live alone and i need somebody to hold me after 10 minutes of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i have finals next week, and i just bought the bundle having never played any of these games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i've never played any of them either, but i'm always hearing about them on reddit, so i figured it would be a worthy buy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,wait... what? .. i don't understand.....
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,you're in for some treats.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"same here, this is the first since bundle 1 that had all games i did not own and wanted to try."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"only played bastion. incredible game, and it works great on my old pentium 4 with a geforce 6200."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i almost bought limbo a year or so ago for 10 on xbla but decided to buy plants vs zombies instead. today i shall be rewarded for that decision by getting limbo plus psychonauts, amnesia, bastion, et al. for the same price of 10. yay!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,you get more value out of this bundle than anyone else in this thread! enjoy!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"never played any of them either. hell, i don't normally even play games on my computer, but still paid 25 for the set just because i've read so much about some of these. so, can i play these on a laptop with a trackpad and keyboard, or should i set up a desktop to download?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,limbo is the only one i played and that was just last month. i'm crying tears of joy over this bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,you aren't so rare! edit i've never played any of the 5 either! closest thing i can claim is watching reaction videos of amnesia players and laughing my ass off!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"as an amnesia player, get alot of custom stories. you won't regret it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"so i'm pretty new with steam and pc games. i'm making a big transistion from console to pc in the next month and i'll be getting a new laptop. if i buy the bundle, will i receive a passcode i can then activate on my new laptop?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,looks like holding out on buying limbo and bastion worked out well for me. and i start holidays on saturday!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i'm in the same boat. even better, all four of those have been on my tobuy list for a good while now. seeing them all in the bundle was like christmas in may."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i'm in the same boat. just got the bundle and started in on bastion. so far, best 7.58 i ever spent, and i'm not even five percent through my estimated total play time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i'm in the same boat. really excited to play all of these for the first time. except amnesia... i'm making my brother play that one while i watch...from a safe distance...with a bat.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"my only problem with this bundle is which one to play first, i already know which one i am playing last amnesia."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"me also  first time i've bought a bundle, but, i've also only seen 1 or 2."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i already have most of the games in it, but i bought it anyway. as far as i'm concerned it's 15 very well spent if it means more like this in the future."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,the previous ones were great but this one blows them all out of the water. i already own all the games but gave them 25 anyway. worth it just for the soundtracks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i agree, holy crap. psychonauts, amnesia and bastion are all very very, very good games and easily worth their full retail price. sword and sworcery is not really my cup of tea, but i can see people really liking it. don't have limbo yet so i am getting the bundle but from what i have seen it looks fun. the humble bundle people constantly outdo themselves. i am very impressed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"definitely, those are all massive indie games, and i really wanted to play all of them. this bundle is going to make a lot, i hope d i would even dub it not just the best humble bundle ever, but the best indie games bundle ever."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,at first i was like omg amnesia! totally worth the bundle cost. then i read the rest of the titles and came to the same conclusion as you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i just have bastion and been wanting to play the other three so safe to say, day  made! p.s. let's not forget sword and sorcery now, i heard its a rather underrated title."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i had thought they had been going downhill. then i saw the kid from bastion. then limbo. then psychonauts. took me a minute to process. then i realized, that good as it is, there are ways they could improve the bundle. here are my suggestions include minecraft, either another temporary trial like they did for a previous bundle, or the full game pay 2x the average, and you get downloadable ringtones of the bastion narrator explaining that someone is calling pay 3x the average, and you can claim that psychonauts is a story of your childhood pay 4x the average, and you can claim that bastion is a story of your childhood pay only a penny, and tim schaffer will track you down and redecorate your house like the meat carnival level from psychonauts don't pay, and the events of limbo will happen to you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,easily the best. all of those are fucking amazing. i've never beaten psychonauts so now i have no excuse.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"better than humble indie bundle 4 jamestown, super meat boy, shank, gratuitous space battles, and cave story? i respectfully disagree!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,no way they could ever top this one!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"yes! i've been wanting to play every single one of these games, and the only one i already have is amnesia! anyone know if i'll be able to give amnesia to a friend, or do i just lose the extra copy?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"you can also tell they tried a bit more to make it nice. i haven't been following the humble bundle since the last one with aquarius, but this one is really nice. they have that cool logo with all 5 games shown on it at the end of the video. it's awesome and they got logan cunningham to do the talking during the video. it all looks really polished."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"oh wow, 4 games i've been meaning to buy, i feel like it's christmas. have never whipped out my wallet so fast."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"is bastion good? i'm broke and only could pay 5, a i didn't get it. did i mess up?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i gave em 20 bucks out of principle! fuck yeah!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i agree. every game in this particular bundle is a gem.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i saw psychonauts and it would be the best humble bundle ever with just that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,except i've got all the games! except superbrothers i just bought bastion about two weeks ago too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,that's what i thought. i just stared at the page for a couple of minutes just to absorb the awesomness xd.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,came here to say this. amazing indie bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i would be... if i already didn't have 45 games and i have sword and sorcery for idevices. so i guess 55.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,what about superbrothers? that game is easily one of the best games i've ever played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"but i already own them all. this is my sadface. i'd buy it just to buy it and give away.. but i don't quite have the money to pay what i normally like to 20, and i feel not right paying like 1."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i paid 30 for just two . worth it though, amnesia and limbo and awesome."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,the only problem is that i already own all of them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"good god, i just jizzed myself"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,is bastion really all that great? unfortunately i dont have 6 atm to get it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i agree it's amazing
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"aye, this is by far the best bundle. pretty much as good as it can get when it comes to indie games. i also predict that notch will be the fellow who pays the most for these games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,best day ever
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i am super excited. i only wish it was cross platform. i want to play these on my 360.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,you left out the best game in the bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"all the main series numbered humble bundles the humble indie bundle 1 to 5 are excellent. that's why i always make a point to support this bundle generously. the games offered are excellent, plus detailed stats, mandatory crossplatform, drmfree, charity, steam support, true paywhatyouwant... in fact, i was so sure bastion and limbo were going to pop up in one of these i hadn't purchased them yet. i feel like a psychic. i made sure to be extra generous for this one. and also because i'm a huge fan of psychonauts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i don't think you need to even point that out. amnesia i have beaten twice already limbo i have beaten once and i beat psychonauts when i was a kid. i played the demo of bastion, and sword and sworcery looked really fucking cool. so yes best humble bundle ever!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i have to agree, i can't wait to try bastion, and i forked out for two copies so a mate can appreciate it as well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i've probably spent countless hours playing psychonauts. with only one problem.... i, i never beat the meat circus. during the time i played it i had one of those logitech controllers with the square holes for the joysticks, i think that messed me up considerably. maybe i'll give it a try again with a 360 controller. i think playing it in 1080 is also a really good reason."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"psychonauts is not my thing, it always looked shitty to me. i'm not even going to download it. i only got the package for limbo and swords and sorcery."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,is bastion really that good? i wanted to get it but i only had 2 dollars right now  i might buy it once i get a job again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"as someone who has never played any of these games, i'm buying a case of redbull for tonight and going wild after class. it's gonna be fun"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"what about sword and sworcery? one of my favourite games of last year, across all platforms."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"the timing couldn't be better  i just built my first pc this past weekend and have been wanting to play amnesia for some time, with the rest of the titles on my sometime list. hurrah!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,yeah this is definitely the best one yet. and wolfire always adds some other goodies later on. my guess is well see some other bundle thrown in for people who paid above the average. definitely pick this one up since i only have ss on my iphone
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,601 people dont like fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i had never bought one of these before. i saw psychonauts and bastion, both of which i've been really wanting to try, and made the leap on this one. now i'm just playing the download waiting game. are amnesiasuperbrothers any good?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,easy there cowboy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,it's so good that i expect that more people will fork over more money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,amnesia yay! play for 5 minutes i have made a mistake
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,all of my money went to developers. eff charity!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,agree. can't buy any of them since i don't have dollars but it's still an awesome bundle!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i'll take 3!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,the one with super meat boy was a good contender. we just need one to include a linux version of terraria for me to be happy forever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,upvote for bastion being bolded. it deserves it

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"it's a legitimately fun, exciting, and thought provoking game. it is my favourite game of the last three years and easily in my top 5 of all time. as much as people say how terrifying it is, it's only as scary as one allows it to be. if you're the type who rarely watched horror movies or plays scary games, you'll probably be impressed with how scary amnesia can be. if you're like me though, who's been watching horror movies and playing survivalhorror games my whole life, amnesia really isn't all that much more scary, though the storyline is superior to nearly any other game in the genre. if you really find it too scary, i'd recommend playing it during the day, in windowed mode this is a big one, with the shades open and without headphones. if you're already used to scary games and really want to shit your pants, try it in the middle of the night, door closed, full screen, with high quality, in ear headphones. but anyway, i really hope people don't just skip playing amnesia because they don't like scary things, the fun gameplay, tight controls, immersive music, and fantastic storyline are really what makes the game what it is, not just the occasional jumpscares. tldr play amnesia. you won't regret it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"paid same way, not received key yet. like someone else mentioned, i think they are probably just overloaded at this point. i'd give it 12 hours for them to get it to you, i'm hoping."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"a link on the final google checkout page says something like return to humble indie bundle. click that and it will generate a key for you there and then, though no email yet for me either."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i have messaged them and they have problems with google payouts.. humble bundle disabled google payout for today
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i just purchased mine on google 15 minutes ago, i was confused at first when i did't receive an email. so i hit the back button to the google receipt and there was a link on the page to hb to claim your keys. i hope this helps."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,sword  sworcery is the most unique game i've ever played. the music is fantastic and it's a very immersive experience. it's probably one of my favorite games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i would say it's worth buying just for the soundtrack. the thing to remember is that it was originally designed for a touch device so some of the magic is lost in translation. however it is still a very unique experience. the dialogue is kind of quirky and you may not enjoy the sense of humor it does not take itself very seriously. if you like point and click games, you'll enjoy it. if you don't, then you might still enjoy it. it's not very long...the whole thing can be beaten in about 3 hours if you power through it. or it might take you a whole month. so in the long run i don't think you'd be too disappointed if you played through and didn't like it. if that's the only game you want you could just throw a couple bucks at it...it's 8 on steam so you'd still be saving money. edit the music used in the bundle video is from ss, so that should give you some idea of how good it is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"the best word i would use to describe it is atmospheric. i am not all that into it myself, but i can definitely see why many people love it to pieces."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i used the lost key function at the bottom of the page and instantly got my key via email afterwards. so maybe give that a try. of course if its their mail server it won't work and i was just lucky.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"yes, the key took awhile to arrive. i confirmed with their support that the email servers were overloaded. shortly after speaking with them i received my confirmation email. i took about 2 hours to arrive after i purchased it. look at the number of bundles sold and its easy to see why their email server was overwhelmed!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i didn't get a email either. but google wallet contained a link that i though would have brought me back to the hb site. and it did but with a pop up that sent me to my key page

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"depends on what you're looking for. this bundle is an amazing deal if you're into indie games, which rgaming seems to be a fan of. i've bought quite a few hibs before and haven't played many of the games usually only 1 or 2 per bundle, so i'm considering passing this one, even though this is one of the better ones. look up some gameplay videos and reviews on youtube and see what you think. if this is your first one and don't have a huge backlog already, you don't have much to lose."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"limbo is a dark 2d puzzle game. amnesia is a dark at times downright terrifying immersive horror puzzle game. i found both to be fantastic and would recommend them. the others i haven't played but i've heard fantastic things about psychonauts. it's got to be worth the pickup in comparison what you'd get for 10 quid or so elsewherein a shop. if you like limbo, see if you can pick up braid the next time it's on sale."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"well they're indie games. means that they aren't mainstream, they don't represent the average game. indie developers have more freedom and can shine with original ideas, these games are all wonderful little masterpieces and make much fun, but i doubt they will show you how the gaming world looks. limbo is special because it's more like art, but combined with an awesome story, bastion has fun gameplay and a wonderful story and amnesia is the best horror game out there. you get the 5 secret hint games that everybody should have played. and you can't do anything wrong because you set the price. if you've never played a game before these will probably please you, but i don't know if they are a good way into computer gaming, you will be dissappointed by other games. tldr buy them, they're worth every penny you're willing to pay, but they don't introduce you to the typical gaming world"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,its worth it for psychonauts alone. the sheer scope of the creativity in that game is astounding. plus  its funny. plus  its well designed. plus  it'll keep surprising you with each level. i won't even go into the other games in the bundle that i've played but they're awesome but this bundle is worth paying 8 to get psychonauts alone
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"cool, thanks everyone. i dropped my donation love that part is charity! and bought 'em. next ignorant question  are these games i can download and then play offline? because that would be a wicked way to spend time when i lack an internet connection for my redditing."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"you pay whatever price you want for a bundle of indie games. a portion of what you pay goes to charity, and if you pay more than the average, you also get bastion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"if you paid over 1 then it activates your steam account, which lets you use the whole community aspect of steam. this allows you to have a friends network there, and ingame chat through steam. this is probably the only benefit of using steam over nothing though, but if you do start buying other games over steam then the universal chat system is kinda nice."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"the main benefit would be that you can download them off of steam whenever you want, which is easier than keeping track of that link they sent you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"there's no real benefit unless the hib servers explode someday, it's just a convenience for people who have steam accounts, they can download their games through steam and keep track of less accounts."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,thanks i found one
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"dude thank you sooooooooo much and take your time man, i'll pay you back somehow"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,a steam giftcard from gamestop probably has less overhead.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"a worthwhile charity. i'll definitely consider donating. that said, bastion really isn't worth the 8 bucks, i think i'll just make a 50 dollar donation to a canadian cancer foundation instead."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"that's not what i want to pay. bastion is the only one there i even want, and i really don't want to pay 7.36 for it. i'd rather pay 0.01. but, seeing as i can make it all go to charity, i'll simply consider it a 10 dollar donation to the charity involved. the rest of you no doubt sent some money toward the site and the devs, so no worries about that."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,problem is that some people like me have no paypal o
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,yes it is  i have a student deal card with which i can't send money outside of the european union

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,maybe not.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"is it just if i'm over the average when i buy it, or would i possibly have to add more later? i'm assuming provided i pay enough to get bastion now, i'd be good for the games added later?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"that's my worry! the only way i haven't shit myself from playing the game is simply that i don't own it. if i own it, i'll definitely play it and then it's all a poop party in trouser town"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,the bastion soundtrack to me is worth its weight in gold. bought it a few days ago and have had it on repeat since.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i already bought bastion on google chrome but whenever there's talking between npcs, the screen goes back, making me unable to beat the game. is there by any chance a way to fix this?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,can't gift games you already own
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,steam will not provide extra giftable copies of games you already own

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bastion looks really cool and innovative. i didn't have the 7.35 to get that one as well but i paid what i could for the others. can you give me a rundown of it so i can decide whether to get it when i have some spare cash?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"so if you already own something in the bundle you can gift it away? i already have pyshonauts, bastion, and limbo but i'm curious about the rest."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,unfortunately the game you already own in your library doesn't get sent to your inventory at least psyconauts didn't get sent to mine
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i feel like i must be the only person alive who didn't really like bastion. it wasn't bad, i just didn't find it worth playing for more than an hour or so. eh, each his own i guess?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,can you gift the games you have duplicates of? i don't want to buy the bundle only for bastion and limbo if i can't gift away the others.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i for one have never played any of the game o so this would have been an amazing pack for me

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i wish i had the extra money to spare for it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i'm definitely not well off financially. i normally wouldn't do something like that but i personally hold the real humble bundles meaning not android or one developer only ones in high regard. there have been a lot of bundle deals being offered now but for me the humble bundles are the original. i also am a member of the eff and donate to child's play every year. bastion was gifted to me and all the others except sword  sworcery i bought on sale. even with the extra 25 i might not even have paid the full price combined for all five games. if there were no soundtracks included i likely would of given just enough over the average to get another copy of all the games to gift out later. they were really what did it for me and i hope future humble bundles include them. i did the default for how it's splits the money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,donating to charityinvesting in awesome game developers. seriously you can't imagine doing this unless you get a commodity in return? i'm not rich either but every time i have a bit of disposable income i try and do this sort of thing since i know otherwise i'll just be spending it on boozeclothesentertainment anyway.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"well, they were kind of the first bundle people, weren't they? at least, i heard of hib back in the 2nd or 3rd and then a bunch more spawned after that. they set the standard and continue to be the best, in my opinion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"someone needs to contact the devs of bastion and ask them for this. edit i contacted the voice of the narrator, logan cunninghamhttpstwitter.com!glancingonhuman edit 2, electric boogaloo six76 provided a link to a 0.99 purchase of a bastion ringtone pack. sadly, it's mainly the music from the game, and a few soundclips. there is one with hello hello, and another with hey kid, you there? that could work, but nothing as awesome as the quote above would be. i purchased the ringtone pack, and if you guys really want this, i'd suggest you do the same. for now, i'm going to look for another way to contact the team and ask about a few new recordings for this. edit 3, the legend of curly's gold ok, sent a message to supergiantgames' official twitter. they seem to be monitoring it right now, what with the bundle release. i also used the contact form on their site. you guys could do the same, maybe give them some ideas for cool ringtones. edit 4, a new age of awesome welp, greg from supergiant games and i had the following conversations. copy pastes from my email 'cause i'm lazy like that, so if the formatting sucks, deal with it! i've done enough for you all! and no thanks! just once you could tell me you liked the sandwich i made you!!! just once!!!!!! original email subject have something you could easily produce that i'd gladly pay you for! sorry if that subject sounds like spam, i was raised by wild spambots. anyway, sent your official twitter, and logan's twitter a message, but due to the popularity of the new humble bundle in no small part due to your awesome presence, we got to talking on reddit, and thought it would be one of the greatest things ever if there were a few narrator ring tones. i know you have a ring tone pack, but it's mostly just sound clips and single words. we were thinking more of a real narrative, the kid hears a ringing in his ear, reaches out to connect with the world. ok, that's a bad example. a really good one can be found here httpwww.reddit.comrgamingcommentsue3w2humbleindiebundlevpaywhatyouwantforc4unlht just so you know, i already bought the ringtone pack, and it's nice. i don't begrudge that dollar, and like i said, i already bought 2 more copies of your game through the bundle, and previously owned it on steam, and had gifted it to at least one person winter sale was kind of a crazy time for me. that said, i'm sure you guys could come up with a few really nice scripts for basic cell phone interactions, get in contact with logan again, make a few recordings, a zip, an entry in your shopping page, and i will gladly throw money at the screen until those ringtones are on my phone. cheers, hope i hear back from you, and thank you again for an insanely good game. greg's first reply hi sretsisworking's real name, which is totally awesome, thank you for writing...! we're listening and appreciate the interest. the specific example you listed from reddit here is a good one, as the author of it recognized that it's important to us to make sure anything the bastion narrator says makes sense in the context of his world. that's why he doesn't talk about cell phones or missed calls and so on. we're pretty protective of the character so we don't want to do things that relegate him to a gimmicky voice, though we agree there's a way to do this right. please don't take this as a promise of anything we're still reeling from the response to the humble indie bundle though i wanted to respond back either way. by the way, logan and i will be part of an ama on reddit tomorrow morning pt as part of the bundle launch so you could always bring it up then and see what happens...! nothing like a little public pressureshaming to coerce us into action. thanks for your support, greg my reply to greg's reply thanks greg. i was trying to keep mine within the world of bastion as well, but i'm not the best spur of the moment writer, i'm glad you understand where we're coming from though. totally understand that you're busy as hell thanks to the bundle. i will definitely push this on the ama, to try and spur you two into action, and then maybe reddit can crowd source a few good lines. thank you so much for the response. only question i have is if you mind if i post this in the mentioned thread so others who were following can see? and also so that this can finally be the glorious day that op delivered. anyway, very much looking forward to your ama, thank you for your response and your time, and thank you and everyone at super giant games for bastion. i'll save the rest of my questions for tomorrow, they'll be from either my true reddit account, whose power none of you could even begin to comprehend, or sretsisworking. greg's reply to my reply to greg's original reply to my original email, and oh dear, i seem to have gone crosseyed hey sure, you're welcome to post it if you like... no email is sacred! i'm the writer on bastion so i'll be the first to say i wouldn't be super comfortable with crowdsourcing rucks, though who knows? the ideas are always welcome and have a lot of fun writing and recording him. the new trailer for the humble indie bundle is just the latest example of that. anyway see you on reddit...! greg there you go folks. i've done all i can for now. keep requesting this at the ama, and remember in your hearts, the day op delivered. my time here is now done, i must return to my people."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i've been putting off buying amnesia.. until now. with my luck i'll decide to play it when my hubs is out of town and there's a storm in the area and no one else to clean my mess but me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i just finished amnesia last weekend. it took me over the course of a year to finish, but i did it. the ending kind of sucks, but it sill is an awesome game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i played it in one sitting, wearing headphones, at night, home alone, with all the lights out. i think i played 10pm4am. i highly recommend playing in a similar manner. try to get into the experience, rather than playing to beat it and you'll get the most out of the game. next time you're home alone and have no commitments the next day so you can sleep in, play it. it's fantastic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"guilty. i have about 20 minutes of playing time and then i couldn't take it anymore. in my defense, i do at least stare at the title every now and then in my steam library and pretend to seriously consider jumping back in."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,its one of probably 5 games i've beaten in so many years...i loved it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"it's a real shame no one bothers to play amnesia, as it's one of the better games i've ever played in terms of sheer immersion and intriguing storytelling. the scares are a part of the overall experience, so i'm not suggesting someone fights their way through the scary to get to the good parts the scary parts are definitely some of the good parts, but it's really not that impossible to play."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i made it past the basement. i didn't get much further, but i beat that basement damnit!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i managed to both play... and beat amnesia. it took about 9 hours total, about 2 hours every night i played. i had to take sanity breaks, which involved walking around a well lit house until i could get enough courage to unpause."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i actually beat the game. in the dark. with headphones. it was creepy, sometimes scary, but it never got to me so much that i couldn't continue."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,shit you got me. that invisible monster..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,me and friends all played it together in a night. at one point i was watching a friend play and i got so frightened my vision went white and i later realized u went fetal in another friends lap. my penance for this was to play the water part. i never hated my friends more.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"i managed that part, and indeed finished the game, but it involved a lot of cowardly whimpering, interspersed with brief periods of panicked, girlish shrieking. i had to physically hold my breath everytime i crouched down to hide. in case the monsters fucking heard me. my wife was extremely amused once i'd explained myself to her."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i'm currently playing it. just got to the sewers. i hear some people say the prison is the scariest part which i've previously passed or the sewers.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"well, there was a linkkey on the page when you bought it, but they automatically send an email to the address you gave them that contains a linkkey which you can use for the foreseeable future in order to download them whenever you wish. the neat thing is, that whenever you go to download the games, you can get them for whichever platform pcmac you desire, however many times you want. the beauty of drmfree gaming."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"the email has a link that takes you to a download page. this link should also be right there after you complete the payment no need to wait on the email. from there, you can direct download the games and soundtracks, or you can take the steam keys and add them to your steam library and download them from there."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"yep. i pirated amnesia, but this was an excuse to get it legit. it's a great game and i am happy to pay for it. although, i must admit, i went 1 cent over the average so i could get the extra game. that is kind of a tool move, i think."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i don't think you're doing it right if there's blood...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"see that's the problem, i'm willing to bet there are just as many people on all three platforms that pay a good amount, but there are just too many cheapskates on windows that pay .01 or 1.00 just to get steam keys and it lowers their average..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"ah, i never noticed that. thank you! just fixed it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"limbo is incredible. if there were an indie masterpiece rating scale, it would be up there with braid and world of goo. totally worth it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"on the download page you got emailed, you can press the second white block with green letters?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"the soundtrack is included regardless if u beat the average, but for bastion you need to beat the average price people pay for the bundles, you can find out what that average is on their website next to bastions logo on the shelf of games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"no, not on steam. i didn't see a download page at any point during the pay process, and their isn't a download link in the confirmation email. edit haha nevermind, they just sent me the second email with the download link. thanks anyway."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"yes, but probably only by a few cents unless someone pays 99999999999999999999999999 or something."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,yes. but probably not by much. you might need 1 more.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"yes it will, it's gone up from 7.38 yesterday to 7.66 when i checked it today."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,your parents are paranoid boobs.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"lets say you payed over the average, and thus earned bastion. if later, more games are added that you have to pay over the average for, you still get them for free because you already qualified. if you did not pay over the average, you'll only get more games added if they're in the 'normal' list, unless you increase your payment to just over whatever the current average is, to qualify bastionwhatever else gets added. tldr if you now own bastion you're absolutely golden."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,i only remember when blockbuster rented out n64's
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,we used to go play jacks down at the sody fountain.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"pedant eh, close. i lived through that, had a kid at 25, and he's 11 now. so in order for me to actually be close to being a grandfather, i'd have had to have had a kid at 18, and he would have to have had a kid at 18 as well. i'm sure that in the lower socioeconomic tiers, there are people who lived through that who are grandparents now. pedant"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,tonight i start amnesia...wish me luck! i'm really looking forward to all the osts.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,ooooh! holds stomach right in the motivation!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"alright, thanks."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,digital file weighed... no gold.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i love bastions soundtrack, and i was lucky enough to buy a signed physical copy shortly after its release."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i read this in mordin's voice. needless to say, i was very confused."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,somehow i didn't read this in the narrators voice.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i want a prequel, i'm really interested in the lore of caelondia."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,the game was very open ended so here is to hoping
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"bastion was a great game by pretty much anyone's standards. great art style, great soundtrack, great narration, great ending, great and diverse gameplay. the only real complaint about it i have heard is that it is a bit easy. i recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"oh yeah, it's that good. it's better."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"it's an excellent game. the gameplay is fluid and dynamic, but my favorite part at this point is music. the soundtrack just works so well with the atmosphere."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"bastion is independent of the other games in the bundle because you only get it if you beat the average. i paid more than the average so bastion came in a separate code, and it would be senseless to use the code on my steam account as hb codes don't give you extra copies in your inventory."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i've gotten a few requests for it already, but i'm going to make sure my close friends get first dibs.  if none of them want it or already have it, i'll keep you in mind"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"it's an action rpg in the gameplay formatview of diablo, but much more fluid. it isn't a dungeon crawlerlootbased game though, it's more oriented around narration and atmosphere."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,i can gift the code.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,hence why i said in another post that it would be senseless to use my bastion code on my steam account.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"i have not activated the bastion code, which is independent of the code the humble bundle gives for the other 4 games, as bastion is the beat the average reward."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"it's an action rpg that has core gameplay mechanics similar to diablo, without the looting or dungeon crawling. it's a very smooth, fastpaced game with a great story and narration. the music really sets the mood and the graphics seem like painted works of art."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"psychonauts, limbo, amnesia and swordssorcery are all 1 code. bastion is a separate code. you can't give away any of the first 4 separately."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bastion is a separate code
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"exactly. having your own opinion isn't a bad thing. you probably feel that way because people who don't like a game, typically won't go out of their way to say how bad they think it is, much the way someone who loves it will go out of their way to say how good it is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,bastion is the only one you can give individually as its a separate code.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"definitely, every game in this pack is excellent. there's also something for everyone, every game is fairly different in genre."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"with bastion, it is. bastion is a separate code from the rest of the bundle"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"limbo, ss, psychonauts and amnesia are all in one code, bastion is separate."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,"if you can really compare a demo to the full game, sure."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-01,"it's not extremely graphicintensive, but a netbook is really pushing it regardless of the game. you'd have to look up the minimum req and compare it to the specs of your netbook."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,some random person on sc2 gifted this to me. i was on a losing streak. thank you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"quick stupid question that might be answered somewhere below my current computer a mac can't run these games but i know i'm getting a new computer later this summer. however, i'm not sure whether that will be a mac or a windows pc. when you pay, is there a way to download these games later? or how does it work?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,bought my bundle!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"to everybody giving out your extra keys, well for future reference, check out playitforwardhttpwww.reddit.comrplayitforward. pretty nice community of people doing just that, giving steam keys away and sometimes even getting some in return. i just thought you all should get some recognition for giving away the keys. keep up the good work and keep playing it forward!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i'm so hesitant to buy though as i already own some of the games. can i gift my duplicates to someone else? not that it isn't amazing still.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"reddit is fantastic! prior to being on this site i was clueless to steam, and most pc games in general. a lot of these games i'd always wanted to play via my console, but didn't really have the expendable cash for them. then this comes along and i would have never even known about it had it not been for this community. thanks reddit!, rgaming, and everyone involved in this! you guys rock!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i still don't understand how people can pay less than 15 for this. i paid that much and i feel a bit ashamed that i'm contributing so little!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,why do you keep adding game i already own?! and yet i have a strong urge to buy three of these packs. such a damn good deal.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,this is even better incentive to get this now. i have a question though. say more games are added to this. does that mean i get them for free or do i not get those games since i bought it beforehand?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"at this rate, i think i've received braid 4 times and super meat boy twice in the last few bundles"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,this is the happiest i've been as a gamer for quite a while.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,wait....i already bought it. do i have to go back and buy it again? do i only pay for the additional games? do they give them to me for free? somebody tell me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"so i bought the bundle and paid more than the average to unlock bastion but this was a week or so ago. i figure i have to buy it again to unlock the new games, right? or is there anything for previous buyers?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"if you buy the bundle, will you get future additions to it? for example, will the guys who bought the bundle two days ago get braid, super meat boys and lone survivor?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"so...is there a way to gift smb and braid, but not lone survivor?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i had already spent 90 on these when they first came out. the only one that i didn't already have was psychonauts. each one of these games is fantastic  if you haven't already gotten them, you really, really should."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i already bought it for over the average price before tthese games were added do i still get them?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i bought the bundle before the addition and just linked all the games to my steam account, yet these new games aren't in my library. do i have to readd the bundle, or something?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,great now i feel like a dick for paying 10 bucks so much games...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"my computer is god awful and i plan on getting a new one, but i wanna take advantage of this deal while i still can. would it be possible to transfer the games between computers?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i already own most of the games in this bundle and still bought it for over the average. every time one of these comes out it's like christmas.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"you get the new games even if you didnt pay the averagebut paid before they were added the first time, fyi for those cheapo people out there."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i am quite happy with my 20 dollar purchase. i mean... damn.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,so since i paid 10 originally do i get the 3 new games?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i love how the first time i buy a humble bundle, 3 more awesome games are added. i might do this more often. i only bought this for bastion to. edit why does it say humble indie bundle 8 moar stuff, instead of 5? httpi.imgur.comfpiww.png"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,haven't they ever heard the saying don't put all your eggs into one bundle?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,so i have a question if i pay 8 dollars will i get all the games? and can i activate these on steam?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i was angry when i first seen this as i paid above the average to get bastion and steam keys and low and behold more new games. nice job humble and reddit for point this out to me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i don't care how much i hear about this, it is still incredible of them. these games are all amazing and this is a deal that cannot be missed by any means."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"dammit, i just bought super meat boy!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i am literaly waving money and yelling 'take my money!' there.... got it. paid premium but it's worth it. own 2 of theese and they are classics. the rest are probably superb games too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i paid even though i have most of the games on consoles, i just thought supporting these artists were a good idea. now i get even more value, incredible!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,they've convinced me to buy it. mostly for smb. hope the pc controls don't drive me crazy after being used to playing on xbox though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"this is such an amazing deal. i just wish i could have gotten into pc gaming later, i've bought almost all of these games full price in the past 3 months."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"does anyone have a spare key for bastion? she just wants bastion... it's not me, i swear. i bought the bundle already."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"what's lone survivor like? i hate to sound stingy, but it's the only game i'm interested indon't have and i only have 20 in my bank account."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"ok i bought it, i have no idea what the games are... i also have hb3 which i've never played anything from. are any of these alright for playing on a low spec laptop lenovo s205."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,wait i'm confused. i already purchased the bundle before the new games were added. can i download the the 3 new additions for free or do i have to purchase again?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,how do i handle this amount of awesome?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,glad i paid double the average. at this rate i will have all the games!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"this is my first humble bundle. i donated some money and got all the games. now, they've gone and added more games and i get those for no extra money?! this is awesome! though now i feel like i should give more money.....maybe i'll gift a bundle. one question, is it common for them to add more games to the bundles like this? another question, how often do they do bundles? edit i accidentally a word"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,ffffuuuuuuccccckkkk i need the new addons!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,so anyone knows how much money was given to charity and devs? we have the total amount but not the shares.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,just bought the last bundle with these game but the last 3 of them... i hate my life
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"braid is so good, one of the most satisfying and fulfilling games i've ever played. can't recommend it enough."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"mhm, is there a way i can get the soundtrack of super meat boy? as far as i know it's not in the bundle but can is it saved somewhere in the program files?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"hmm, can this be gifted?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i already owned the first five, and i own these three too. i don't care... it's so good and i already have every other humble bundle so i need to buy this out of principle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,does anyone know if gift codes expire if they arent redeemed within 7 days? i bought it for a friend but he doesnt have internet
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'm so impressed with this project. i had every game except super meat boy and i still got this bundle. i got a game to torture myself with for charity!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,considering if you already bought this you get the others as well this is very cool
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i have searched but cannot find an answer to this question can i play these games on my ps3? i want to buy them, but i don't want to play them through my pc. i will be paying at least 8 to get all the games and the steam code but i have never tried using steam on ps3. sorry if this questions has already been asked and answered. thank you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"they should've added jamestown or cortex command, they were really good. i actually missed out on hb4 so i assumed they would give that bundle with the next like they've done in the past. not complaining though, these are amazing games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,humble bundle........ the greatest gift to mankind since the graphics card.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"if i already bought the bundle, before they added more games, do i get the four new ones? i paid 15."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"is there any way to see a chart of how much goes to charity, developers and humble bundle? i'd like to see the ratio."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,this is absolutely the best bundle i already own all the main games on. it's like they're mocking my last three years of indie purchases by offering them to me for like 120th what i originally paid.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"that settles it. i just bought my first humble bundle. lots of games there i've wanted to try, and for a good price and a good cause i can't resist!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i have a question! it says pay more than the average of 78 bucks to unlock these four games. does that mean that if i pay like 9 bucks, i get those 4 games for a total of 8 games? or does it just unlock them for a second purchase."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,so...there's like no excuse not to get this now.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,now i have to buy it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,on account of owning or having completed or both the new titles added i doubt i'll be needing my key. anyone want it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,everyone who bought humble bundle 5 before these games were added might have received these. i bought a bunch and gave them away here on reddit and myself and everyone i gave a bundle away to got these games. thank you humble bundle!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,everyone else seems to know whats going on and somehow i just can't find the answer i'm looking for... in the humble bundle iv i donated 25 dollars... well above the average. does this mean in order to get the new games i have to once again purchase the games i already got and the new ones? or is there some magic trick i am unaware of?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i just paid 8 cents over the average, for 2 games. i have got bastion for 4 cents. i'm not sure if i'm a scumbag or nots"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i have a mac and i never game, but for the past few months ive been debating whether or not to build a pc. well i contributed 50.00 all towards charity, and im not even sure if i can play half of these games. i dont care. maybe someday i can when i have a pc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"what if i already bought the bundle at 8.00 above average... can i still get the other three games? if so, how.."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,this will get buried but if anyone wants smb and braid for free send me the game lone survivor and i wll send you a code for all three games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,but i just bought it yesterday does that mean i can't get super meat boy? or are they gonna give me those games too
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i bought this bundle already and paid more then average at least at the time but now im in a location where i can't download the new games for a while bw limitations. how long do i have to download these before my personal link goes down?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"awesome, bought! especially looking forward to lone survivor. had a little trouble remembering the ingame shortcut keys, so i concatenated some screenshotshttpi.imgur.comgoycu.png. handy on my second monitor!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,wow lol thx for the deal!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i love the humble bundle but i hate that i already buy indie games at normal cost, and these damned nice people bundle them for the cheap and all i get is feeling ripped off, like i should wait until the times of year they offer the bundle. obviously it's all for a good cause and there are minimums, but usually that minimum smokes the cost of one of the games alone."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i've already donated  can i play these on xbox 360 arcade somehow?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"just got the bundle, tried to play super meat boy  got this error.... httpi.imgur.comgszme.jpg here are my pc specs httpi.imgur.comuvwjk.jpg a quick googlehttpwww.fixya.comsupportt2338822procedureentrypoint mentioned to just delete the cwindowssystem32dwmapi.dll but i don't have that .dll in the system32 folder? would appreciate any help."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i just purchased one and sent to my dad for fathers day!!! he will love braid and bastion... and discover others he will like!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,best. bundle. ever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"holy ship. just holy ship. there's now no reason any pc game shouldn't buy this, it's literally the best bundle of games on the internet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,annnnnnd purchased.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i another somewhat related topic, should i buy the king arthur collection that's on steam right now? i'm curious about that game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"wait, i already bought the bundle beforehand, so do i get these games or do i have to rebuy?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,why did i have to already buy it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"just bought it, mainly for super meat boy, limbo and amnesia since those are the only games there i know are really good but i will definitely play the others!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,holy crap! best surprise ever
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"thanks for the heads up!!i donated a legit amount this time. lone survivor alone is 10 on steam. have an extra limbo, amnesia, sword  sworcery, and psychonauts steam key if anyone wants to trade."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'd think this is worth a hefty sum. i'd donate if i could.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"the bundles just keep getting better, take that all you people who didn't pay the average...even though i already had limbo, and super meat boy. but braid is nice!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,if only they added the binding of isaac instead of smbbraid. i already have them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,finally people can get the chance to play psychonauts. i remember my friend and i accidentally stumbling upon this game before it came out and watching the days count down on their website. it holds a very deep place in my heart
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i have a dell inspiron 1525, would downloading this bundle be worth my time?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,do you still get the new ones if you already bought the bundle?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i was a bit concerned i wouldn't get them because i already bought them, checked and there was a key already waiting for me.  love these guys."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,how does this work if you've already bought the bundle?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i like cowboys.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,why can't i use an amazon gift card as a payment type... i am frustrate. i'll have to actually use a credit card.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,yes! i've been wanting to play super meat boy for a long time now!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i never played pc games before this. i bought the humble bundle and have been sort of playing psychonauts, and it is now my goal to finish these games by the end of the month, jeebus."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,does anyone know what the combined cost of these games and soundtracks would be separately?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i'm not one for buying games because i'm on mac, but this was just too good to turn down. 6 because i'm cheap for some amazing games. thank you humble bundle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i am having trouble running super meat boy but the others seem to work any advice
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"and i still can't buy it, just because i have no credit card and paypal won't work for me  this is only making it sader for me... take my 20! i want to give you to them, why wont you let me?!?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i keep bringing up the bundle page, but always put it off when i can't decide how much to pay. now if i buy it, i get three more games. my procrastination is finally being rewarded. i wonder if anything else will be added? maybe i should wait a little more..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"bought it! anything for the kids, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'm just wondering when amnesia the dark descent is coming to consoles if it ever will. my computer just can't handle it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"if i already have bastion, what happens do the copy i buy?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'm so unhappy that i can't get these really good games and get money to the developers  because i am not allowed by my parents to get a paypal account. it's about the personal information that you need to give
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"so should i wait a little longer to get this when even more games are added? lol also, does this allow me to get steam achievements?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"bastion is still stand alone, which is perfect, because i already own it. probably gonna give it away to someone."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,honestly the best 8 i ever spent. by far.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"bah, i still can't get access to the bundle 2 that i bought."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"that's it, i'm getting this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"bought meat boy for xbox and pc stand alone, bought it in the previous bundle, and i shall be buying it again shortly  definitely a first world problem."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"oh my sweet jebus people, buy this bundle before it's gone and you will not regret it. best hib ever. period. until hib6 which will hopefully be even awesomer!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,it is so awesome that they are doing this on linux as well
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,thats it im getting this!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,do i need something special for my laptop to play amnesia? i want to play it but i don't have any special gaming equipment.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"dear god, could this get any better?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i had to contribute some more to get the other games because what i paid at first wasn't higher than the average is now. but you know what? i ain't even mad. i'll most likely pay some more when i get more money just because i love these guys and what they do.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i'd pay more than that just for the bastion soundtrack  seriously that shit is amazing, check it out if you haven't!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"awesome, although this is only possible since it costs them nothing to donate and distribute games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"say i already buy this and get they steam codes, but already have limbo, can i separately gift limbo away?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,is anyone else having trouble running one of these games? all of them started fine for me except amnesia.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,this is amazing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,do you still need to pay more than the average to get bastion? the wording of the website has confused me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,not sure i can resist any more.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,thank you for posting this... i almost forgot about it... and now there are even more games!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"if anyone wants to gift me lone survivor ill give you bastion and lone survivor, braid, super meat boy."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,this bundle is full of so many good games that i already own most of them for my xbox. still bought it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i have purchased two bundles! i felt guilty for not paying enough.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,so do i pay 15 and get to pick the 4 games i want or is it random? do they provide steam keys? how dies this work exactly?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'm about to explode from excitement!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,what if i have already donated to this for 2 people before the other games were added on?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i've been wanting to play amnesia for quite some time, and i really think i'll enjoy lone survivor. happy to donate to this one."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,how well will amnesia play on my late 2011 15 4gb ram macbook pro? am i better running it in bootcamp?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'm holding off until next month's inevitable indie bundle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i bought this on steam. where do i go to download these game they added? also, how might i access downloads for the soundtracks later? edit nevermind, i figured it out. use the lost key button at the top of their website and enter your email address. follow the link in the email and click the link in the page to show steam keys. click the button to renew the newest key for the games that were just added."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"saw it, bought it, love it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,the only thing that bothers me about humble bundles is...i already have all of these games and i still want to purchase this one to support developers.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i already own all of these games on either my pc or 360, but charity is always nice. plus, choosing who my money goes to is a nice perk. 10."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i already own 62.5 of the games on the list. i think i'll have to pass, this time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i just have to say thanks to the people at humble bundle. i only wanted 2 game and had little cash so i only donated 3 the second day of the bundle. i still got the new games that were added to the bundle. even though i donated less then the average. these people are amazing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"note for linux users super meat boy has finally been updatedhttpsupport.humblebundle.comcustomerportalarticles579609supermeatboy6712changelog, and most bugs are fixed but some issues still remain. the headcrab works and the final boss no longer segfaults, but you still can't access super meat world or the leaderboards."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,the best part is if you bought it early you can go back to that url they mail you to get the new add on games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i've never done a humble bundle... i have almost no room on my hdd and the only games i have on there i'm currently playing. i can buy this now and install the games, say, 56 months from now, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i tried super meat boy on linux and it is horrible, do any of these guns run anywhere near decent?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i already have smb, i installed the other 2... is there some way to gift it? i gave a friend bastion since i have that too. 3"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"my bro got me these games today, he called from another city and told me to check facebook quick d love ya krunos"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"already own braid and meatboy, is lone survivor worth it or just give it away?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"at first i was like oh no! i should've waited until now to get them! now i'll have to pay more! you have to understand that my knee jerk reaction was disappointment as even though i'd only have to spend eight bucks to get them, my brain instinctively just said said spending more money is bad! avoid spending more money! but then i clicked on my old download link...and i was pleasantly surprised. d"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i've had more fun playing these than any aaa i've played this year!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i know, i know, macs suck for gaming or whatever, but i feel really compelled to support this. does anyone know if most of these games will work on a regular ol' 2011 macbook pro by any chance?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"this is the first one of these bundles i've seen that is actually worth it. usually it's a few sub par games packed with one decent quality one. looks like they picked only decent or above titles for this bundle. too bad i've already played all but two of them. still if anyone hasn't played bastion it's good for an indie game, recommend it just for that game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"my brother told me, after i had purchased the original bundle, that they keep adding games the later it gets. i was kind of bummed that i would have to miss out on all of those, but i would totally pay again. i checked the humble bundle page and noticed they did add games, and i kind of flipped at the awesomeness. then i checked my own bundle page and passed out for a few minutes while they all downloaded."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i've been curious to try super meat boy for ages now, so this was a very, very happy surprise to wake up to! i hadn't tried any of these games prior to buying the bundle, and it's been fun. my personal favourite so far is bastion. great game with beautiful visuals and an incredible soundtrack. i wish diablo had a similar control scheme as bastion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,shut up and give them your money!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"now that i have these games i would love to go play them, but after spending 9 hours on psychonauts and having my saved game deleted, i'm a little hesitant"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"hm.. i have all these games except braid, super meat boy and survivor. oh why was i so hesitant on buying the bundle"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"if i just bought humble indie bundle v this morning, before they added on these additional three games, what happens to me? do i buy it a second time?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i already have some of these games, what do i do when i redeem the code from steamsince it unlocks multiple games and i have xtras? i dont see the xtra ones any where"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,shut up and take my money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"to bad i didn't have enough to get bastion, but all of the other games are really awesome!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"alright, question. i expect to get fucked verbally, but i'm curious to know. what is this whole indie bundle thing? i've literally seen it all over reddit for a while now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"checked my email for the download page, and found my email from the voxatron bundle. checked it out, and noticed it, too, had grown since i initially bought it! suddenly i have so many games! both these addons and the ones from the voxatron debut bundle!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,is bastion any good. i am trying to decide if i should get it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,damnit! i own all of these except for lone survivor... and i want it so damn much.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"what are your opinions on braid, super meat boy and lone survivor? i may increase my order amount to get these games. i bought this after it got announced"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,psychonauts? that isn't really an indie game... i mean it was published as a retail release and everything.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,just got mine!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"once you use your key for steam, can you share it with your friends so they can use it as well?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,an amazing thing for them to do. will keep me loyal to them through the next bundles and beyond.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,eight fantastic indie titles in one day...have i died and gone to heaven?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"why does this have 7,747 down votes? do people not like the idea of cheap stuff or is it the charity part that bothers them?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i keep on wondering if the next bundle is going to be as good.... and then it always is and then some.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"is it weird that i have a few of these games for 360 already and i beat them, bastion multiple times, but i still want to buy them again, just because?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i have a pc and a pretty crappy linux laptop that can run braid out of the pack. can i install the rest of the games on the pc and then braid on the laptop or they have to be installed in the same machine? thanks in advance.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,fine i bought the bundle lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"damn if it was active one more day then i would be paid, always next time"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"this just had to come out when i was broke... hmmm, what can i sell."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"they sent me the added games! i didn't even ask they just sent them to me! humble bundle kicks so much ass, i wish i knew about this earlier."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i deleted my key page and then they add these games. anyone know if it's possible to get that back? requesting my keys again doesn't seem to bring me to the original page where i was able to download my games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i just pulled this down last night, as well as buying super meat boy off steam normally. oh well, i still think it's a great deal...my only wish would've been to add the new games' soundtracks as well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,might as well add rest of the indie games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,sigh where's my wallet... again...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,this is amazing. more amazing than watching the hulk beat the crap out of loki.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,why hasn't anyone really mentioned lone survivor? it's fucking good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i've only bought bundles 2, 4 and 5, but they threw in 1, 3 and the introversion bundle all in there for free!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,and you can get the new ones after you already payed? my summer is going to be more awesome then ever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,so a lot of words are a part of something regarding a lot more words. got it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,the best game on there is now officially super meat boy. i have had it for more than a year now and it is the most amazing platformer i have ever played. a get it now!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i am soooo happy i decided to wait before buying this. thank you 3
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"fuck, i cant transfer any money from my debitcard to paypal. is there any humble redditor that could transfer 1 dollar to my paypal account?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i bought the first set of games before they added on the last three. would i have to pay again to get access to the newly added content?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i donated  can't wait to play these awesome games!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"dammit, why did i buy all these games separately already?!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"the thing is, with most humble bundles, you can download the games for free somewhere else online."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"question  im probably gonna sound like a tard...but... i bought this the other day, and now there are new games...but how do you get back to your download page?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,all of my love to these guys.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,lol what the hell are they going to put in future bundles?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i just bought it. looks great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i bought lone survivor like a few months or so ago and... i haven't played it for weeks now... spoiler warning no jazz at all...httpwww.youtube.comwatch?featureplayerdetailpagevp5rqqkckjst1420s
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i love the humble indie bundle so much, but the only problem is that i already had super meat boy from a previous humble indie bundle, but it doesn't even take it to your steam inventory, i wanted to give it to a friend, that's really annoying. great bundle anyway."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"don't get me wrong this is awesome, but it's also a massive mistake by the guys running the humble bundle. they should have raised the amount required to be donated to double the average in order to get these new games. it'd still been a value and their charities would get even more then.  also, what are they gonna put in future humble bundles as an incentive now?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i checked my old link to the last two bundles that came and holy crap there was like 10 add ons for each. if you still have your links to the old bundles go check them!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i feel really cheap, and that makes me feel bad  i had 1.48 left in my paypal account after selling a playstation 3 i had purchased with money i had earned from christmasbirthdaylawncarebabysitting ... i had to use that money to pay an outstanding debt someone in my family had accrued. i gave it all to charity though, i really hope 1.48 isn't an insult to them... these games look absolutely amazing. i want to pay more and if i can earn some more money i will most certainly donate more."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i love braid so far. much more deep than i thought. i even bought two bundles, one for me and one for my brother."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,does anyone else feel a tiny bit guilty for paying less than 10 bucks for this bundle?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,awesome. just bought it a few days ago. loving bastion!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"sadly, as amazing as this bundle is, i already own all of these titles individually!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i just bought it and bastion itself is worth the 20 i donated. good cause, great games!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"holy shit super meat boy was added, just amazing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,i already own. . . . all these games. . . . firstworldproblems

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"this is my first time hearing about bastion. i'm floored with how beautiful the game is! what a great concept. first time i've done the hib, so worth it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i already own a few of these games and i'm not so smart, how do i give away steam keys for other people to use? i don't normally use steam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,this is one of those moments where it's sucks to be a grown man who doesn't have 10 bucks. these moments happen often.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i was hoping for bit.trip runner as well, although you can't rule out them adding that also later. with as amazing as this bundle is, i think what they really ought to do is if you pay 3x the average, you get all previous bundles. i've bought most of them already, but you better believe that i would bump my payment up to 25 or whatever 3x would be to get every single hb game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i once thought about buying it but then i read some angry reviews that called it waaay too hard and stuff so i was too afraid of buying it. now i have it and it's amazingly awesome. opretty much the only hard game that doesn't make me ragequit for some reason lol

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i paid like 7.50 and felt just fine. what you contribute is not important. it's the fact that you're contributing that matters. it costs them nearly nothing for you to download the games. that's the wonder of digital distribution and why piracy is not theft. you're just getting a copy of the game. you're not removing anything from them. they're not losing inventory. so if a couple million people pay a dollar they're getting more than if much fewer people paid 15.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i paid 30. the games are worth at least that much combined, and as an older dude, i have a little bit of disposable income."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"yep, pay 8 dollars and you get all of those games including some of the soundtracks. there is no catch."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,humble bundle is a fairly recent development on the pc gaming scene. last month will only be one year since its inception. you only really hear about it for about two weeks at a time on a somewhat bimonthly basis so it's not surprising that it can be very easy to miss.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"oh no, 8 to get games worth much more than that? what a catastrophe!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"but you can still pay what you want! and considering that you could still pay as little as one cent for four games, that's not a bad deal. yeah, it's more to get all eight games, but right now the average is 7.88, so it's still less than one dollar per game, most of which have been raved about again and again by critics and normal gamers alike."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,well there are things called running costs and expenses to pay... p
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"nah, not really. they might be shrewd to recognize most people's inability to leave something on the table, but they offer a very solid deal for x where x  whatever the fuck you want it to be and then incentivize higher xes. you don't have to take the incentive, and it's not like day 1 dlc where you ought to feel like you're being screwed out of an essential part of the experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"you only get 4 games if you pay under 7.90. and the money is going to independent developers and charity, why would you do that?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"actually, you don't even have to beat the average. i didn't i owned all the games except superbrothers sword  sworcery ep and my link now has steam keys for all the new games. as long as you paid at least a dollar, you'll have steam keys for all the games except for bastion. if you beat the minimum, you'll obviously also have bastion. i suspect that even if you didn't beat a dollar, you'll still be able to download the new games directly from their site."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i realised something... if people consistently pay more than the average to get the deal... won't that push the average up? that's clever.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,wow.... kinda have to wonder why minecraft isn't in the bundle though...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"unless notch pays this himself, instead of mojang."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"soon notch is going to run out of people going to buy it, mainly because everyone will already own it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"not to mention the publicity that's probably worth much more than that. what people like notch and companies like valve have shown is that being the good guy is worth shitloads in brand loyalty. i would never pirate a valve game or something from mojang because they seem like good guys. guys you would want to be friend with. guys who you would like to sit down and play some games with. gamers who do what they love because they want to bring us good games. sure, there is money involved, but the genuine feeling is that these are people like us. no one would like to hang out with ea, and that probably cost them a shitton of money in missed sales every year. not that they care, their business model of being the biggest and churning out shitloads of games doesn't need that. the missed sales from people hating them is well recovered by dlc and aggressive marketing followed by day one sales."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"of course, how much of each minecraft purchase does he personally get?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,just think how much he could be donating if they added minecraft to the bundle!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,does that include all platforms?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"so that means that if i bought minecraft, i donated to humble bundle? awesome."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"surely the majority of that isn't profit, but still. i'm sure he made it back pretty quickly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"no that are just registrations, not people buying. 13sec for buying p"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,definitely not. each payment has a fee associated with the card. then the company is taxed. then notch is taxed when he gets money from the company.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i can't be sure, but i think you may be looking at registered, not purchased."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,they're as indie as ea. who had their own indie bundle a while back. and psychonauts wasn't indie when it was originally released. although double fine has since been emancipated.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"exactly, that's why i think it would work really well if everyone pays just above the average, the average stays about the same. but if you have to pay 2 or 3x the average, the average quickly moves up. they'd have to set some kind of a cap, of course, but it would be a great way to push it up near the beginning. they'd still have the same main deal where better than average gets you some other bonus, though."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,yeah. i paid 1 before the new games were announced. to get the key for the new games i just clicked on lost key at the top right of the of the humble indie bundle page where i clicked through an email confirmation link then i was provided with the new key.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"actually i was wrong, it seems everyone who purchased already gets them regardless."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"aw, thanks anyway"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,what i'm saying is that you're only getting a digital copy. they're duplicating what they have and sending you a copy. they lose nothing in the process.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,why?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,one of the devs said that about 1 cent purchases. they do not lose money at the 1 level.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i have already bought all of those games not even in bundles, psychonauts twice by then on xbox and pc, braid in a retail copy. i had 4 bucks in my account. and i just sent a gift copy to my girlfriend. i only paid one dollar because it was just for the bonuses that i had no idea what they were at the time. don't insult me when you barely know a thing about me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,i'm taking advantage of the business by paying what i want in a ... pay what you want bundle. really?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"the steam key is for the bundle of braid, smb, and ls. if he gifts it, he loses the other two games as well. that said, he could just download braid from the site, drmfree, and give that to someone. technically it's pirating but if he already paid for the game twice..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"you can't just give braid, the key contains smb and lone survivor also. if you didn't want any of those, yeah just give the steam key away. basically you can't separate braid and the other games because they are activated on the same steam key."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"atta guy. haven't been there in a loooong while, but i remember it as a relatively good community. word of advice don't give your key to any newlow karma accounts, or any accounts with low ratios, and also not any accounts with no ratios at all. anyway, good luck with your keys!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"nah, i play amnesia at medium settings instead of high, but everything else is great. i am having problems with psychonauts, but according to the support forms those are due to a recent update on the developers' end, not the user end."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"nonsense. it's no more illegal than sending the steam code. it's only illegal if he sends the same installer to a dozen people. he bought the game, he can give it away any way he wants, as long as it's to one person and one person only. edit this pagehttpsupport.humblebundle.comcustomerportalarticles243192ifialreadyhaveagamesinthebundledoihavetheabilitytogifttheextracopyinthebundle says we're supposed to consider the bundle an indivisible unit so they don't want us sending steam keys or installers, but that's pretty much an unenforceable edict. if your friend doesn't have steam and you want to send the installer, go ahead and do it. i bought the bundle despite owning all but two of those games and they were games i don't care about. if i want to break the bundle down and spread out the individual games to several friends, i'm going to bloody well do it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"1 confirm. i just went back to the link and it had added a steam key for the new ones, so thanks for the info!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"yes, your literal words are correct. but consider the case of people who want to donate the bare minimum required to beat the average so as to get bastion. in that case, every donation less than the average is reducing the amount that such people pay! and even over the average you can contribute to the average more or less. i don't really have a grasp on how this effect interacts with the buyers in any way so i can't say for certain whether they're making more on the low donators than they are losing to the lowered average but it's clearly not as simple as you laid it out. i do suspect that you're mostly correct, though, but i'll continue to err on the side of giving them money."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"the part where it is not physical, not losing inventory fails. imagine that you want designer to make something for you, a project, but you want to cancel it half way, or want to pay him only half for what is worthagreed, or you use it anyway, but don't pay at all. hi still does have it, hi didn't lose his copy of, let say, logo, but he did lose his time and his rights were violated. in the case of huge companies and other digital products that are mass consumed not prepared for specified client one person can cause minimal damage, but it is still damage. you are leeching on someones else time spend of work, fraction of it, but still. so this isn't so bad as real thievery, but piracy still isn't fine thing to do. but here they did agree for this specific form of paying, so paying even one dollar is ok imo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"it costs them nearly nothing for you to download the games  it costs money to develop these games. a lot of money. every person that downloads the game for free is one less person to put cash into the developers pocket. you are removing revenue when you pirate a game. as for a couple million people paying one dollar argument. 2,000,000 dollars is not enough to pay the developers for some of those games and that's why they have a higher asking price. on the other hand, iphone games can sell their games for 1 dollar because they have lower game development cost and they include advertisements in their games. tldr piracy is theft even in digital distribution."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i remember one of the devs, it was either fg or the bastion guys, but they were talking about the bundle guys losing money, not them of course."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"you are correct. when you see the word please in agreement language, it's hard to interpret that as anything but an unenforceable request. nothing in humble bundle's terms of use provides that the games purchased become an inseparable whole. hib does include that you will not share your download page with anyone, but that is the extent to which they can bind your activity, since it involves your use of their service the website. everything from the terms language suggests you you receive a number of independent licenses for each game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"sending a copy of a game that someone else did not buy is called piracy. if it was a disc, that would be perfectly fine. but since it is a digital download, and since when you give the game to the other person, you are making a copy, that is what makes it illegal. if you are duplicating the game, then it is illegal. there would be no way to actually make it legal, because you are not ever giving the original away, you are only making copies. even if you only send it to one person, it is still illegal. plus, that is taking money from the devs, so it isn't cool at all."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,humble bundle isn't recuperating development costs. these games have been out for years. plus you can't get the humble bundle for 0. piracy is not theft. you are not taking anything away from anyone when you pirate. you are simply making a copy. they lose nothing.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"in this case, whether it is illegal or not depends entirely on how the individual licenses for each game is written. if the agreement states that you receive a nontransferrable license with no right of distribution, then any sort of transfer of the game installer would constitute either a terms violation or an infringement of exclusive copyrights. some software vendors do write their agreements like this see vernor v. autodesk, and at least the 9th circuit has upheld the enforceability of such terms. but lets look at it this way i own like six copies of world of goo. if one of my friends hadn't played it yet, i'd gladly give them the installer and say, here's one of my copies, enjoy! and not feel the least bit bad about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"exactly. as long as you're not reselling or endlessly duplicating the games, nobody's going to give a shit. in this case, it's not about the letter, but the spirit of the law."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-09,"this is so much nonsense i don't even know where to start. sending a copy of a game someone else didn't buy is called gifting. if you buy one copy and send that copy to the person, there's nothing in the world that says that's illegal or piracy. piracy is not merely the act of transfer between two parties. if you buy a code or installer, that's yours to give away give away, not give a copy of if you download the installer to give away, it's not piracy unless you keep a copy to play yourself. your definition of piracy is so broad i'm wondering if maybe you work for the riaa. if you send it to one person, it is not illegal. it's a gift. and it's not taking money from the devs, because you paid for it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,amazon payments is unbelievably secure. stop fishing for a free key.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i'm talking about how averages work. in order to get the entire bundle you have to pay more than the current average. say the average is currently 5.00 and, for sake of argument, this is among three buyers. if somebody comes in and pays a penny the new average is now 3.75. if the next buyer wants to pay the minimum required to get the entire bundle they now have to pay 1.25 less. in essence, in order to make that penny the hib guys lost 1.25 on the next guy. now, spread this out at a larger scale and i'm not actually sure what the real numbers look like and how much of a difference it really makes. but it's still not as simple as they just get all of the money paid to them so more people paying is good. also, anything less than .30 for paypal or google checkout methods or .05 for amazon also costs them money due processing fees so even if the effect on averages is an insignificant effect paying as little as a penny actually is removing something from them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i understand you're point about the humble bundle not recuperating development costs and i thought you're statement of 'it costs them nearly nothing for you to download the games' was generalized to all game developers. i still think you are losing the point i'm making about how piracy is theft. you are taking material they spent a lot of money developing. they lose you, you as a person who would have otherwise given them money for the material they made. in an extreme example, if one person buys a game. if everyone in the world pirates the game, or 'copies'. then the developer has sold one copy and yet everyone in the world is playing the game that the developer spent their money on and now they lost a lot of money. because everyone made a copy of their game without paying. so it's not directly theft, but piracy is not paying the developer for material they created."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"oh jesus, you had to bring it up. i had almost forgotten about it and you brought it up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"the problem here is in gifting the steam key which most people seem to want to do or just a copy of the installer while you can still download the game from the site and play it. i say if you have another copy already or just don't do it if you don't it's morally okay, as long as you give it to just one person. i am sure though that this is legally forbidden no matter if resaling is allowed or not, because you actually can't give a game away here. a similar situation would be if you had a game that was optionally on steam like the original halflife, registered it there and gave the cd away."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-09,"well, let me explain how wrong you are, now... it is common knowledge that you can go onto the humble bundle site, and download an infinite number of installer copies. this then means, that the only way that you could send a copy to a friend, is if you buy the bundle, and give the steam key to him. he is not an owner of the game, thus, if he is found with the game downloaded, and having not payed for it, that would be illegal. that is the way the us law defines it. it is not a broad definition, and i do not work for the riaa. you do not have one singular copy, so you cannot give it to a friend. it is licensed to you, and you alone, so no one else can have the installer, unless they have also purchased it. it is like saying that since you uploaded a torrent, you own the game, so you can give it to people, since you own it. well this is not the truth, because you would then be infinitely duplicating and distributing the game, which is, by definition, illegal. even if it is just one person, that is defined as piracy, and that is against the law. i am just trying to save people from getting hefty fines from the evil corporations that want to abolish piracy, because they will try and make an example from you, and fine you for a ridiculous amount. if you want to break the law, be my guest, criminal. the only way it could be legal, is if you do not also have the ability to gain the game again, or if it is a physical original disc copy that you are giving someone. if you were to send the installer in such a way that you could not go back to the download page and download it, then, and only then, would that be legal. next time, be sure to know the facts before uttering blatantly false things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"eh, i personally think he's a nice guy. whatever floats your boat, i guess. edit upvoted because we should all be able to share opinions, though i'm extremely curious as to why you dislike notch so much."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"you are not taking any materials. you are making copies of it. they're losing nothing. people aren't pirating as an alternative to buying. most people who pirate wouldn't buy the game anyway. piracy is not lost sales. that's an incorrect notion. if you don't have the sale to begin with, you can't lose it. if you're talking about imaginary money, it's pointless. piracy is not theft in any way, shape, or form. hell, it shouldn't even be called piracy, because that's the biggest reason people associate it with theft. it should be called copying. when you copy something, the original is left behind. this is as much theft as taking photographs of paintings in a museum is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i didn't get the maximum.i didn't get bastion, and gave away the 4 main games since i already had them. furthermore, if i just wanted to give a dollar then that's my choice. usually i give 34 unless i want the bta game. but still, stop making me out to be a monster even though you barely know my situation."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,haha interesting. i'd completely restart steam because that's not right. even my uninstalled games tell me what their sizes are it says not installed then 4.7gb not 0.0gb.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-09,"obviously, a lot of this relies on the honor system, but the crux of the matter is this if you buy one copy of the game, you have one copy to either keep or give away. the manner in which you give it away is completely irrelevant. it's only when you or someone you give it to plays a copy that wasn't paid for that it's piracy, and illegal. in fact, the fact that the op is giving the game away because he already owns a copy damages the piracy argument even more. let's remember that this is the humble bundle if they really worried that much about piracy and revenue, they wouldn't let loose a drm free file that people could choose to pay practically nothing for. if people wanted to pirate it, there are a dozen easier ways to do it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-10,"by your logic it's no more legal to send a single steam key than to send a gift code which simply gives access to the download page to the giftee. luckily, the law does not work the way you're suggesting, otherwise everyone would be in jail including anyone that rents a game and anyone that buys used software. your ability to get additional copies has fuck all to do with it. they have to prove that you made more than one copy. they'd also have to prove that your friend got the copy from you in order to prosecute. which would require them to somehow find out, which they can't because the games are drm free. please show me the section of us copyright law that stipulates the hefty fines that evil corporations have set for gifting a single copy of something you bought. also, feel free to add in some precedent cases where someone was found with a single copy of a game on their computer and prosecuted for not being able to produce a receipt. you're clearly not a lawyer, and you clearly have not the slightest bit of familiarity with the law in general, copyright law in particular, or the specifics of enforcement. you have no idea what you're talking about.  by the way, you might want to remember when you're on reddit that not everyone lives in the same country as you do, and are thereby not subject to the laws you purport to know so intimately something you've plainly failed to consider in your absurd warning."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"well, where to begin. he promised many features on minecraft, went on vacation all the time. then called an unfinished game finished, never completed those promises. and passed the game off to his bitch. he also tries to get as much attention as possible. starting drama on twitter. insulting yogscast. and just generally acting like a huge asshole, he gets away with all of this because fanbois who will defend the man to his last breath. he stole a game concept, so fucking what. now stfu, enjoy his goddamn game. and quit thinking he is your best friend.  that message goes out to all of his stupid fanboys."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"well, of course! it's just weird thinking of such an enormous company still being considered indie in the way. usually the corporation aspect corrupts companies long before they get to an estimated 30 market share. i usually think of valve as simply valve. the good guys, you know? those guys. that's valve."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"true, i guess they only count as a real publisher if they also publish games made by other devs?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,they're more indie than bastion then.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"nah, i've just become increasingly cynical and jaded in my visits to reddit. there's some good stuff on here, real good reasons to visit, but there's so much garbage... i really should ignore it, but it's difficult to sometimes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"it has everything to do with what you said. it is true that it is unrelated to your literal words that they're not losing inventory but it is related to the rest of it.  what you contribute is not important. if it has a significant effect on the average then it is important.  it's the fact that you're contributing that matters. unless there's enough of an effect that small contributions net them less money.  you're not removing anything from them. but you might be decreasing the amount others pay.  so if a couple million people pay a dollar they're getting more than if much fewer people paid 15. but if a hundred people cause a thousand people to pay less then hib may be netting less. the effect of the average may not be what you were talking about, but it is clearly related."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"you hit the nail on the head. if you don't have the sale to begin with, you can't lose it. that's the most frequent argument for piracy isn't necessarily a bad thing. also, what if the person that pirated the material gets it more exposure to other people?then those people buy it!  i've heard this a few times. i don't think either of us are completely right or wrong, but i think there is truth in both our points. i just hope i shed light on my side of the argument a bit. if you look at sales of material when piracy is prevalent, then sales go down. for example, the effect of piracy on cd sales, studies suggest that internet piracy played a significant role in the decline in cd sales in 2001. with piracy, sales go down. so there are some indications that when piracy increases, sales lower. so that's a good counter to the notion that 'most people who pirate wouldn't buy the game anyway'. by the way i'm a researcher, so i usually base all my arguments with stats and trend data."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i don't think he's trying to make you a monster. but the fact that they're giving you 8 games, 4 soundtracks, and they're donating to charity on your behalf, and you consider that a dollar is worth all you're getting regardless of what you do with the main games, is probably not the best you can do. we're all trying to lead with the example, we act as we consider everybody should act. if everybody had given one dollar, it would be extremely hard for humblebundle to justify another release of this quality."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-10,"the definition of piracy of software also known as copyright infringement is as follows the act of copyingduplicating any copyrighted software and distributing it without official authorization. here is what you ask yourself  am i copying the software? yes, you are making a copy available to you by downloading it through a web page which you and only you have been authorized to make available to yourself.  do i have official authorization from all the individual copyright holders of the works i am attempting to distribute? no, none of the copyright holders have formerly stated, through a written document, that you may distribute their works as you please.  outcome? it is piracy. i may not be a lawyer, but my sister is. also, i have studied the definition of piracy, and all the piracy laws. in any country that has laws about piracy which is any fully developed country, and many underdeveloped countries, piracy of software also known as copyright infringement, is defined as i have previously stated, which is as follows the act of copyingduplicating any copyrighted software and distributing it without official authorization. it does not matter if you are making a profit or not. if you do not agree with that which would be dumb, as i clearly defined piracy twice, and explained how the situation is piracy as per the definition..., then look at it in the moral view do not be a dickface. buy the fucking games, and stop being a cheap bastard. you only need one dollar to get all the games excluding bastion, and we all know that everyone can afford one dollar, especially if you have a really nice gaming computer, a stable internet connection, and you spend time browsing reddit for hours on hours. or you can really not be cheap, and beat the average. if someone has a friend that is too cheap to buy a set of games for one dollar, then he does not deserve to have the games anyway. i only make an argument against this because these are independent developers. they are poorer than normal development studios. they are nicer. they are cooler. if you cannot be nice back, by simply sending some money their way for making such awesome games, then you are a douchebag, and you do not deserve to play any games. also, the humble bundle donates to charity. think of the children. don't be a dick, just buy the games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"sheesh. promised many features, went on vacation. i can understand that you're upset about that. called an unfinished game finished. that's your opinion. look at tf2. would you call that unfinished, just because it has constant updates after having been released? never completed promises... true. not finished... yet. still updating, and i have to admit that even though i was pretty sceptical around the time it was released, it's really improving now. passed game off to his bitch. now you're getting kind of rude. don't call him his bitch. this is the reason you're getting downvoted, not just because of the fanboys. anyways... what is wrong about that? you think that's a horrible thing, that's your opinion, i suppose. tries to get as much attention as possible. starting drama. insulting yogscast. explain. mention two examples that aren't yogsgate. yogscast were swearing at the conference, according to him, and though you obviously side with them we haven't gotten the full picture from both sides. this was on twitter. just generally acting like a huge asshole. go ahead, make my day. elaborate. i take it you're just going to end this argument with a you're a fanboy, you don't know shit, pulling apart an analogy, or something trivial like that. please, answer me, how is notch an asshole? if you manage to present your evidence in a convincing and nice way, maybe i'll be persuaded to think your way?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,one event is enough to mark the public consciousness. i'm really not looking forward to possibly being famous one day.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,"i'd say it depends on what kind of deal they have. if it's a simple i make game, you distribute kind of thing then they are still independent, even though they have a publisher. this is the case for quite a few indie titles with boxed versions world of goo comes to mind, where the devs simply leveraged the publishers existing infrastructure. the primary sign is when the publisher came on board. was the design already finished then or at least far along? did they change anything because of the publisher intro logos don't count? i'm not sure how it was with bastion, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"unsub from the default subreddits and sub to reddit.comrtruereddit. the front page with defaults is good for a laugh now and then, and the occasionally insightful article, but it's nowhere near what it used to be."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i'm ok. to be honest, i did got an offert with free codes. and i'm still moving to pay for the full package, not just 12. just saying because i have no fucking clue about how did i sound back there, i was busy and wanted to solve this problem asap. now it seems i have 6 more days. duno, you could try to rotate what you see, depending on your mod. if you do not want to suport dumbass, askscience is always the best way to learn new things, and it's the most strict subreddit i know about rules which is good. also, bestof and ysk usually do the trick for me when i want to see 0 fucking or aww posts. farewell!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-07,it has everything to do with what you said. it is true that it is unrelated to your literal words that they're not losing inventory but it is related to the rest of it. literal words? as opposed to figurative words? what are you saying? if it has a significant effect on the average then it is important. it doesn't matter what the average is. they still make money on every payment. unless there's enough of an effect that small contributions net them less money. less money is still more money than no money. but you might be decreasing the amount others pay. that's not logical. your payment will not decrease the amount others pay. it's all up to each person individually what they pay. there is an average but it's only going up. but if a hundred people cause a thousand people to pay less then hib may be netting less. less than what?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"for example, the effect of piracy on cd sales, studies suggest that internet piracy played a significant role in the decline in cd sales in 2001. that's completely false. piracy does not affect sales. the vast majority of people who pirate would not buy the item otherwise or in the case of game of thrones, cannot buy it. the reason cd sales declined was because of the availability of mp3s on the internet. itunes and other similar digital distribution channels for music were the main reason cd sales dropped so much. it's convenient to blame it on piracy because the boot fits, but unfortunately facts don't support that notion. with piracy, sales go down. sales don't go down. if a sale doesn't happen, it can't go down. you're playing with imaginary numbers again. piracy isn't the lack of a sale, because like i said before, people who pirate wouldn't have bought the item anyway. so there are some indications that when piracy increases, sales lower. there are no such indicators. that's an incorrect correlation that people make. sales are not affected by piracy whatsoever. if you remove piracy the sales would reflect exactly the same results. no one says i want to buy this but you know what? i'll pirate it instead! that's not how it works. people who take the effort to pirate never intended to purchase in the first place. by the way i'm a researcher, so i usually base all my arguments with stats and trend data. oh really? where is it, then? read this httptorrentfreak.compiracyistheftridiculouslostsalestheydontexistsaysminecraftcreator110303"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"i know, he's just trying to defend his point. and i know i should pay more. i really should. i got a random dude 4 games, and myself 2. that should be worth more then 1 dollar. but like i said, i was only in it for whatever bonus i may have gotten. i already bought all of the games except for lone survivor, bastion too. and i just had 4 dollars in my account. very true, i should lead by example, but to be honest i just enjoy cheap indie games. i have supported humble bundle before, and many other bundles, and will continue to do so."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"be proud of yourself, this is super cool and really well done."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"you know that limbo is not the character name, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,the difference here is that i think the artist here dosnt actually know what limbo is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,i dont think his name is limbo...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,this is incredible. well done. im sure youve been asked but can you do one from the game inside?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"i speak for most players of limbo when i say, fuck that part! that shit was so creepy! loved the game though! was violent in a subtle way that actually made it more disturbing in a way."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,for everyone complaining about the characters name not being limbo and saying the artist doesnt know anything about the game the name of the piece is likely in reference to the song run boy run by woodkid. the music video for this song shares a lot of its visual style with both limbo and this drawing. also highly recommended. neat drawing my dude. keep it up.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,limbo is a place not a person

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,that part of this game used to scare me so much
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,limbo and inside are two of the most depressing games ive ever played. the vibe that they give off is something truly unique.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,that's awesome man. nailed the look and feel of it. beautiful.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,awesome. and what a great game!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"you're the best, dude. you should draw me next!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"i love when people call the main character of a game the title of the game. like not being rude, i actually love it and laugh really hard every time. like if someone says oh look, there goes halo, off to fight the covenant again. what a hero just loved the idea that the kids name is limbo, haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,perfect medium for this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"looks great. i would consider changing the name of the piece, however."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,what? this is just a game screenshot!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"i think this is the kind of game that would greatly benefit from the white colour on black paper treatment. perhaps if you want to do another limbo drawing of a darker area, could be a cool way of doing things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,and limbo was his nameo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,this game was really scary in parts. but really good i did cheat of a couple of the puzzley bits. just wish it had an actual explanation as to what went on.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,httpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikilimbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,my friend spoiled the game to me saying in the end the lights are turned on and you see that in reality it was a beautiful world. dunno if that is a secret ending or something but it lead to some great confusion when i finished the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,wait is the kid actually named limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,this is a screenshot... right?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,is this really a charcoal drawing? looks like you just put a screenshot in photoshop
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,yo this is just a screenshot

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"the limbo timeline isn't the the world itself, but the world that the character is in?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,probably a reference to run lola run.1998 movie

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,thank you.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,right! and next youre going to tell me that blonde girl in green is not called zelda and that robot is not called metroid! s edit added s because reddit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,he is described as a nameless boy so he could be called limbo but the name limbo is certainly about the place.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,limbo is the space between life and death. which is the setting of the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"i'd love to do that! gotta play the game first though.. i made this one before playing limbo, now everyone's making fun of me 'd"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"the title is part of the work, so i comment on it. leaving out the rest isn't good either though"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,he finds his sister
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,"appreciate the kind words! it's true, i don't know anything about the game. just saw my little brother playing it a few months ago. its darkness and beauty immediately struck me.. so i thought i should totally paint it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2018-09-03,what if the character you play is the personification of limbo?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,"do any make the game better, or will it still be one people convince themselves has to be good because it's deep."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,iron giant did it for me

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,"i still remember seeing spirited away for the first time on cartoon network when they had a anime special. i loved all the movies from that special and began my love for japanese anime, but spirited away was my favorite and i watched it every time it was on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,i liked the iron giant one. the rest were a bit out of proportion in respect to the characters.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,no face scared the fuck out of me as a kid.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i've never seen 3 so i don't know but if you haven't seen 1 and 2 you should, especially 2. they are excellent anime movies. even people who don't like anime have told me that they enjoyed them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,couldn't tell if i was having a hard time recognizing the first three or if i'd just never seen them. thanks for helping me figure out it was the latter.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i only got the last two references
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"number 3 is the studio ghibli film i've been trying to remember the name of for ages! i've never seen it, but i've seen most of their other stuff, can't wait."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,"also, i think howl's moving castle is in the background of the spirited away one. not completely sure, though, haven't seen the movies in awhile."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"the first three are all anime movies by studio ghibli, and they are all absolutely fantastic. in order they are spirited away, princess mononoke, and my neighbor totoro. i highly recommend the first two, especially princess mononoke, and while i didn't like it quite as much my neighbor totoro is still very charming."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i use the portal crossover as my desktop background. i really should buy a print from the artist at some point since they used my feedback for it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"you're right, except that song is in the beginning!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i like. very inkeeping with the style. worth pursuing i think.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"honestly, i think the colossus not being pure black  white like the rest of the foreground really clashes. all it needs is a simple recoloring and it would be fantastic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,but they're so nice and friendly.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,my bf makes fun of me because i'm absolutely terrified of spiders and seeing a giant spider silhouette freaks me the fuck out every time. especially when you walk up to it and it sticks its one leg out... ugh. no.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i got as far as the spider and gave up.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,the developer calls it trial by death. don't feel bad...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,any link to where these could be bought?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,get. this. game. by far one of the best games i've ever played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"since it's hella cheap on steam, i guess... it's only about 2 hours from start to end, the story is really bland, and the game play is trial and error and error and error... i wasn't really a fan."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"yes. wait for a sale, it goes down often. but yes. yes yes yes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"1. spirited away, 2. princess mononoke"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,while there may be the slight overlap in terminology the two don't really fit well.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,1 hour left on steam sale at 2.49. go go go.httpstore.steampowered.comapp48000
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"wauit for a sale, it's been 75 off a couple of times in the last couple of months. do it and never look back"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"eh... i managed to beat it 100 in under 2 hours, it's a pretty short game. i guess since it's on sale, that's a little better, but i've played flash games with more substance than limbo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,from another comment.httpichigopaul23.deviantart.comgallery?qlimbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,iron giant is a really depressing movie.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i liked limbo until i got to the water puzzles, from that point on it stoppd being inpired and turned merely good."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,fatasstic?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,definitely recommend on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"check out the pc demo, if you can run it smoothly then go for it. i say this cause limbo's performance is pretty bad even though it's 2d, and you could have a nasty surprise. also, both keyboard and gamepad are fine."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,played it on pc with 360 pad plugged in. worked great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,better on ps3
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,yes it's a great quick little game. atmospheric sidescroller with physics puzzles.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i played it together with a girl in front of an xbox, taking turns when someone dies and you can die quickly, till the sun got down and all went dark and devoid of colour. very well made and stylistic interesting game. there is a reason it is well knownremembered and pops up regularly in gaming discussions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i say not really, unless you have 5 to throw away. the game is only about 2 hours from start to finish. you'd be better off playing some flash games on newgrounds."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,whoosh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i have to say that it did, before the spider was an inspired game, after it it was mrely a good game. i still loved it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,studio ghibli is well known for their excellent animated films. i'd recommend almost all of them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,number 3 is awesome also. cat bus!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"my favorite by the same studio is 'howl's moving castle' by far, highly recommend."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"no love for porco rosso, anyone?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,my neighbor totoro is actually my favourite one. you must see it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i found that mononoke had a style to it that was beautiful and rich with culture, but i think that it didn't quite daretodream quite so much as spirited away did. it didn't quite contain the liberty that spirited away did, but it came exceptionally close. still one of my favorite movies, however. i feel that spirited away should never be made in a new style, yet if i were told that princess mononoke was to be redone differently, i would be quite interested and not at all upset to see the result."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"agreed. princess mononoke is a must see. my japanese teacher showed us the film when i was in high school, and i'm thankful for it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i don't like anime, but spirited away was an awesome movie!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,but how did she know what pigs her parents were????
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"second this, anything miyazaki makes is gold."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i watch a good amount of anime and really disliked princess mononoke. on the other hand i love spirited away and the iron giant, also enjoyed my neighbor totoro."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,even more excellent movie if you liked those two nausicaa of the valley of the wind. girl with lives in a postapocalyptic world with a huge poisonous jungle spreading across the whole world during humankinds last years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,you need to watch totoro right now
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,spirited away was one of the few anime films that i enjoyed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,someone who doesn't care for anime here. spirited away is a goddamn amazing film.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,just make sure to get the one dubbed by 20th century fox.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,my neighbor totoro is th shit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i enjoy them a lot, but i watch no anime. just got the 2012 collection for christmas."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i've seen spirited away and howl's moving castle, where should i go next?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,especially 1 also  pretty much anything directed by hayao miyazaki is fucking amazing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"it's not that i don't like anime, i just haven't seen much of it and don't seek it out, but for others with limited exposure to it, akira is definitely something to experience, if not for the story than for the explosions, and the dvd has ridiculously superhuman pencil tests."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"watch my neighbor totoro. the feels in that movie. ugh. also, watch the grave of the fireflies if you wanna cry like a little school girl."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i love ghibli, but i think howl's moving castle is my favourite."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,"my neighbor totoro is the best in my opinion. i watched spirited away when i was little, so i got scared shitless by it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,you haven't seen 3 ???????  man you are losing a half life there
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,don't you dare call miyazaki anime. that's blasphemy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,hehe
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i'm not going to say it's bad or anything, but i just don't understand the devoted fan following of the nightmare before christmas."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i had to stop playing it for a bit. that spider was scary.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"wow, i just clicked this with 23 seconds left. i didn't even have a chance to look at what it was, but i tried to buy it based on your recommendation, and when i got through to payment the discount had gone. dammit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,still only tree fiddy if you're in the uk. i got to your comment late
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,care to explain more? i'm thinking about getting it and am curious why you think so.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i once tried playing it off. a lot more black than i'd expected.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"sorry. didn't realize i had left out pc or. i don't own a ps3, but your input is appreciated nonetheless."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"yes, but wait for a sale"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"ah, my bad."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i dont give it that much credit. it was brilliant before the spider. after that it became mediocre and by the time you start seeing factory stuff it turns into '101 ways to kill a kid' simulator. now compare that gameplay against all those 'ooh aah how artistic' articles there was about limbo at the time. i was very disapointed and when the end credits rolled i just quit the game and uninstalled it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,almost all? which oneones didn't you like?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,1 for totoro
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i got this movie for christmas. already watched through it once. i also got the brave little toaster. nostalgia at its finest.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i didn't like totoro. it just seemed like an elaborate setup for cat bus.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,mmmmrrrrrooooaaaaaaaaaooowwwweerrrr
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i have a special place in my heart for ponyo after watching it high as all fuck
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"if you haven't, i'd highly recommend reading the source material howl's moving castle is based on the book by the same name by diana wynne jones. as much as i love miyazaki, and as much as i hate being the angry neckbeard who yells the book was better!, the book is a completely different and imo much deeper and more emotionally compelling experience."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,finally saw this movie last night. loved it! i can't wait for the sequel next year!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,aw yiss motha fuckin porco rosso. i absolutely loved that movie.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"could you give me a rough synopsis? edit i don't know if synopsis was the right word to use instead of summary, i just wanted to sound smart."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,ponyo is pretty awesome too... has a surprisingly star studded american voice cast if you haven't seen it...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,princess mononoke is in my opinion his best film. also my favorite of all time...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i think their story is so different it had be emphasized in the tone of the movie. i mean mononoke is a much darker story and the scale of it is so epic it had to be a different style and not as lightheaded and free as spirited away. both great movies though . . .
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i much prefered mononoke to spirited away, though i think both were great. i thought the atmosphere of mononoke was just much more enjoyable, more like a serious story than spirited away. spirited away felt much lighter to me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"ours too. maybe it was middle school. one or the other, but it was a subbed vhs from japan, and i remember going home to look up the movie and realizing that it hadn't even been released in the us yet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"fun story, i had seen a bootleg version of that movie at a friend's house in japanese i think years and years before the american version came out...but i didn't realize it. then, several years later, ads for the movie started showing, and i was getting stupid amounts of deja vu before i realized what was happening. i was really confused for a while."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,wow really? what made you dislike it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,you aren't alone. i'm an anime watcher and i never understood the love for this movie. yeah it looks pretty but i didn't thing the story was all that great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,didn't like mononoke?! i want to downvote so bad......
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,this was my very favorite one. a friend and i found all seven of the manga for nausicaa and bought them at this year's otakon. worth the 70 we spent on them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,it is anime. so what?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,how do people have enough free time to do this?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,because they look a like?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,"agreed. i was real young the first time i watched it and my dad was tearing up. although i didn't understand then, i thoroughly understood why he did watching it now that i'm older."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,holy fuck
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,the wait to preorder it after finding out they were making it was the hardest part for me.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"the puzzles are amazing. you should definitely get it. also, the sound and visuals fit very well. one of the best indie games out there. you kind of do get stuck on some levels though but once you get the feel of the environment the puzzles become clear and its just the matter of timing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,"no worries, very convincing art."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"the only part that really stands out in my mind is when you reach the hotel, but that's more visually impressive than anything else. i hated the trial and error game play, the story was convoluted for the sake of being convoluted, and it was shorter than most flash games. by far my personal choice for the most overrated game of all time with gta iv or darksiders coming in a very close second"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i don't think the ending was disappointing, in fact i think the ending suits very well to the overall theme of the game. albeit it leaves more questions than answers, i just think the creator of the game wants us to fill in the gaps ourselves."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"one of the newer films is based off of the story of the borrowers. the use of detail in the animation is nice, but i felt like the plot was rather shallow. edit in comparison to ghibli's other works"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"yes, but anime is a style of artwork for the cartoon. i'm not experienced in this, so i could be wrong, but this is what i have picked up"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"it's been years since i've seen it last, so it would be hard to pick out specifics anymore. the main thing i remember disliking about it was that the story just got progressively more and more ridiculous. also, i couldn't get into the story or characters in the first place, i found them all boring. that combined with the stories progression made everything turn from plausible within the stories confines to be annoying to watch and follow."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,curse you differing of opinion!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,the manga is great. the movie is only part of the manga series.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i screamed like a bitch when i encountered the first spider. that game was not made for arachnophobes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,i was waiting next to that for about 20 mins trying to figure out how to do it without going anywhere near the spider.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"i didn't love the puzzles so much  what i really loved was the feel of the game, the way the creepy sound and flickering backlights made me feel out of place. what i meant by the puzzles is that at the start you run through a forest and get creeped out by the scenery  a hanging corpse, man traps, bodies floating in a pool, ect. but at the end, there's a lot of puzzles and that felt like.. well, a 2 indie platformer. make no mistake though, it's a brillant game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,hotel sign gave feeling of awe. only positive emotion in that part of the game. level design was quite..erm. horizontal?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"yeah, the ending was really good. it was just the puzzles that i hated... it turned it from having an atmosphere to a sidescroll puzzler."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,the ending scene was fine. all between killing the spider and seeing the ending itself was bad. i dont mind leaving things to imagination. i wish there would have been something else as content. perhaps a story about other kids who try to stop you all the time?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,it also disregards the book it is based on pretty much.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"miyzaki's work, and studio ghibli's generally, doesn't conform to the aesthetics or story telling tropes of japanese anime and is probably referred to better as japanese animation. while thematically different, miyazaki especially pulls from the great japanese film directors like kurosawa and ozu there's actually a fantastic video of miyazaki meeting kurosawa near the end of his life and the beginning of miyazak's career on youtube, if you understand japanese. studio ghibli generally also pushes back against a lot of the tropes of anime in a very guided way. japanese anime really begins with the manga of tezuka osamu and in some way or another all anime really goes back to that well. miyazaki personally blames tezuka for the poor visual quality of japanese anime  you can see this in the very distinct ghibli art style as well as the emphasis on fluid motion. in it's stance against the objectification of women and the valuing of old japan rather than fetishizing it studio ghibli in general and miyazaki in particular especially early in his career differs thematically from anime. finally, in japan ghibli tends to be treated more like film and less like anime. i'm not saying you can't buy totoro plushes in akihabara you can, but the same distrust and disgust most japanese have for nerdy anime gundam, evangalion, or the kids basement relegation for others sazaesan, doraemon is completely absent from ghibli's work."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,it's a fan theory since studio ghibli had to publicly debunk it on their official blog.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,that's why i used project ako as an example. it's also feature length but is in that historical line from tezuka's work. miyazaki's work isn't.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"by western nerds like you. i majored in japanese and lived in japan for four years. ghibli's out put is treated more like film and less like anime  either nerdy stuff like gundam or children's stuff like dragonball, doraemon, or sazaesan. i did academic work on kurosawa, and have a pretty good understanding of japanese film history. i've been watching anime since i was a kid and that was a long time ago so i'm sure i can beat your assload. on top of that i've watched stately samurai films from the 40s and 50s, little known pinku directors from the 90s, chambara exploitation films from the 70s, and i know where ghibli fits in in the worlds of japanese animation and film. ghibli is different from anime which is why it's held out as special both in film and animation. in japan, miyazaki is not really an anime director  he's just a director. ghibli trancends and supersedes anime to become a part of mainstream film. of course, that's impossible to tell when you don't speak japanese and all your experience is from downloading subtitled naruto from bittorrent. edit sorry i replied to you. looking at your comment history as myself a muslim it looks like you're just a vile racist."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"anime covers all animation. your friend is right. miyazaki is anime in the same way pixar is anime. in short, it isn't. that's why i suggested the term japanese animation as anime has different nuance in english and japanese. while you could use the word anime in japanese to denote ghibli the word doesn't mean the same thing in english, much like otaku is a specific kind of otaku in english and not in japanese you can be an aquarium otaku for example. in either case ghibli stuff isn't anime like gundam or even the artsy anime like satosho kon paprika, millenium actress. the way your friend is using anime it would cover on japanese everything from ghibli to tom and jerry if you're old enough to remember that. however in a particular sense ghibli isn't treated like japanese anime  like gundam or doraemon. as to wikipedia the entire culture around japanese anime is written by western nerds. however from a film perspective it is obvious that miyazaki is working from a film perspective and not the anime lineage going back to tezuka. and yeah based on your comments about muslims it kinda seems like you're down on muslims. in any case if i sound upset your one friend and wikipedia don't really rank as sources to me as i've been studying this stuff academically since 2003."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-31,i like this better.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-30,"it's actually true. i know one of my ex's parents watched tom and jerry and refers to it, generally, as anime. i don't think they still show tj on tv in the u.s., but i was at the very tail end of being able to see it on tv during childhood, likely partially due to the violence. so, i understand your perspective that anime is a medium, but i still don't think it's correct. if we're speaking english, animation is a medium. ghibli is animation. pixar is animation. naruto is animation. anime refers to a specific subset in english, of which i would count only the last example. for many japanese anime is the same word as animation, but the culture around anime would be the same  excluding the first two example. as for the islam thing your response to this comment  for that matter, i can say that any religious institution, islamic or not, creates an environment were extremism can grow. was this  islam just seems to be really good at it. if islam were better at growing extremism, the world would be on fire. islam is the second biggest religion and yet there are only handfuls of extremist which, by the way christianity has had too  see the crusades, the mormons, almost all of europe's historical wars had a religious element. in fact, if you read japanese history, buddhist monks ! were considered militaristic and players in both war and politics which is why nobunaga destroyed temples when conquering japan. between the huge muslim populations of bangladesh, india, and indonesia all relatively mellow muslim countries if islam were better at promoting extremism, we would be in a constant world war. instead, the effects of colonialism especially in indiapakistan and the middle east are much more specific causes for extremism which then coopts religion."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,and here i thought the monsters would be doing the limbo

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"well, this is extremely kickass"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,the catacombs would be a fuckin nightmare...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"amazing that something like this hasn't already been done. that game 'brutl' had an art style that i couldn't look at, it bothered my eyes. bummer, because i could go for a game of that style right now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,depth map
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,oh god imagine blight town or the catacombs....
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,so...why would you do this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,very cool and artistic but thanks to the nature of dark souls i would only be able to use it if it had the health bar minimum and ideally a limbofied hud.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"but the kiln of the first flame looks so, so much better without that mod. it's one of the most fantastically atmospheric areas in ds1."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,for anyone wondering he is fighting the final boss of dark souls 1 gwyn in the kiln of the first flame
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,the weapon looks like a dildo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,i watched this gif far too many times before realizing it was not a mod that lets you limbo in the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,i'm more excited that someone else uses server.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,why do we need a mod for limbo in dark souls. that game is already limbo lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"whoops my coding fucked up the render engine and is only showing the z buffer. fuck it, it's a feature. i'll call it limbo souls. aaaaand release."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,needs white eyes
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,the art style of the game is so good though. it's kind of a shame
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,looks really cool
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,because dying was too hard. let's make it easier to die.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,was hoping for limboing in dark souls.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,quite possibly the only area where this is a good idea. can you imagine sen's fortress? bananas.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,would love some high res screens taken from this mod! beautiful.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-25,this area is super clear though. like without the mod this area is already very black and white. i'd imagine in an area where light wasn't cranked the fuck up like up to and including nito would be impossible
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,should make enemy and player assets gray or some shade other than the ground. maybe red for some stark contrast. just not black on black.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"oh god imagine blightown and tomb of the giants with that lighting! make sure to bring solair with you, he'll light the way"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,what does it do i see no difference
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,please tag it spoiler because this literally shows the final area and final boss of ds
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,fuck limbo. it's fun but it's such bs
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"developers, get on this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,what do you mean??? it's just as clear and visible as the last few years of hit tv shows
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"i was gonna say, looks like the depth buffer xd"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,technically this mod came out first d
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"if i remember correctly, this was done by a streamer who let the highest donator choose what weapon he had to use for this run. apparently someone decided it would be funny to watch him groping around in the darkness of blighttown trying to find the damn thing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,warning for this mod this mod disables particle effects which means that spells are invisible.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"actually, this mod makes totg easier. since it bases brightness on how far away things are. therefore, you wouldn't need a light source."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,thought it was just going to be some guy limboing under every attack.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"limbo is a neat little game with a color scheme similar to this mod. it was featured in a humble bundle a while back, which is probably why so many people have heard of it. definitely worth playing, it's on steam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,limbo could've gone on for 3 years and i would have loved every second of it. but i imagine dark souls is a much harder game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"this uses the depth buffer, so anything that relys on darkness as an obstacle would become much easier to navigate."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"it honestly is a fun game, people overblow the difficulty because it is harder than most games to get a hold of the mechanics but once you do it is a cake walk."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,there was a thread last week about how you can do just that. i don't remember it but a search for depth shading might help you find it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,i see what you mean but i loved the new look of the kiln with this mod the most. ash lake also looks amazing and more spooky.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"are you brave, warrior?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"because it doesn't fit the games art direction. it's a fun mod and all, but it wasn't built with this look in mind. artistic vision and such. that's why mods exist"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,you're asking why they don't include an infinite number of art styles?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-31,it's mainly a mod for people who have already played a hell of a lot of dark souls and want something new.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,no. paying attention to your surroundings is the most important thing you can do in souls. it's one of the main reasons most people have to use guides because they are too stupid to use situational awareness. this would make the game harder.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,nobody would know that until they read your comment
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"to anyone who downvoted this guy, look up the game limbo. this looks like a 3d version of that game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,i'm sure developers would love to render the depth buffer only. imagine how much money would be saved on materials and fragment shaders.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"totally know what you mean, ever since they killed off patrick spongebob squarepants has gotten true detective levels of dark"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"holy shit! i thought it was just me, but i find myself turning the brightness up on every device when i am trying to watch more modern shows."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"yea, most definitely is the depth buffer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"it's at the very fucking back behind a bunch of stupid enemies in side the swamp itself so grabbing it poisons you, then like an hour into the game later you can get the same weapon with better stats, 10x easier."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,it was lobosjr i'm pretty sure
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"that sounds real fun for something like crystal sage, i think ds1 bosses telegraph specific attacks well enough that even without being able to see the attack you could avoid it assuming you can actually see their body."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,requisition me a beat!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"if you loved limbo, check out inside which i believe is made by the same people. you're welcome"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"yeah it's not that hard, it's so much fun and addicting, especially that feel when you finally manage to beat a boss that took you many tries, or the feel when you start a new character and you steamroll everything because you know the map like the palm of your hand, it's these things that keep people hooked on the dark souls series!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"it's make for a great temporary side area or something. a brief interlude with something like this could be a cool effect. overall though, would be super boring after a while."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"true, but it would be a great effect, like poison or corruption."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,yes thank you
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-25,wait what?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,did they really?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"yea they're darker thematically and darker literally. i can't see a thing. stopped watching most of them though, i don't have this issue with the ones i still watch. you can't even see actors who are any color other than incandescent lily white in the brightest of rooms. what's the point of the visual if you can't see people's faces and body language? might as well be a radio show."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,i can't believe it's not depth buffer
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"i agree. that's why they made him do it, they wanted to make him suffer for their amusement."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"yeah, but the server does grant that bonus hp on hit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"whats the better weapon of it? i had one that i think i infused with lightning and it was god tier. the health regen it gave was minor, but you could stun lock forever against other players."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"that challenge would be nothing for lobos, he knows that game better than his bedroom."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,the moonlight butterfly would be a god damn nightmare for a melee character. unless you summon beatrice like a sane person
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,the streamer that did this challenge for ds1 lobosjr also did this challenge for ds3 if youre interested.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"it is made by the same people. it took playdead like 6 or 7 years to come out with a sequel to limbo. now i have to wait another 6 or 7 for a sequel to inside uggghhh. imo, limbo was way better. the puzzles were a little more clever and fundamental. and harder. i felt like inside was way too easy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"it would be cool, but it's often impractical. these sorts of filters would take time and resources not only to develop but more importantly ensure that they work properly. a lot of people might see some major graphical issues resulting from a goofy bonus mode and call the game out on it. gaming sites would call the game sloppy, etc. lots of risk for no tangible value in sales."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,the season 2 finale of vikings was like this. there were times when i honestly couldn't tell who was killing whom.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,isn't that more or less the dark souls way?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"oooooh, a whole like 20hp a hit when average hp is 1500"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"the murakumo, it's the same weapon basically, but instead of the gimmicky hp regen it had way higher base damage and a b in dex. it's a monster and has one of the highest poise damage stats of any weapon"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"more importantly ensure that they work properly. yes, this is the big one. mods don't have to go through an extensive quality assurance process that game features do, and if it gets fucky or there's parts that are brokenunbeatable, you just uninstall the mod. you can't do that with game features without it being at least a huge pr nightmare and at worst actually affect sales of the game or future titles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,yep d
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,meh edit tough crowd
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"7hp, actually"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"still, enough to buy you time to get an estus down after a few hits. combine it with the black eye ring to get the hp on hit and the hp after"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"the murakumo was my absolute favorite weapon, i couldnt bring myself to use anything else. too bad they changed the moveset so much in the next two games, i really didnt like how it became."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"i tried it a bit in 2 when the recolored blue one got released, but i didn't like the curved greatsword style. in 1 could it chain stun people to death? i remember server was amazing at that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"one of its attacks deals mostly physical damage and is easily blocked. its other attack deals mostly magic damage and needs to be dodged with decent timing. without the particle effects, you would also not be able to see the telegraph on the explosion before it lifts off again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"i mean, you could also do a faith build with soothing sunlight and sanctus and make a build around it, but that's gimmicky as hell."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,that's the most optimistic thing i've ever heard about a sharpened garbage can.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,right? ds2 murakumo was a shell of its former self...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"yeah it could. in ds2, the murakumo got a harsh nerf so it didn't do as much poise damage. for good reason though, as poise damage was opaf when the game first came out"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-23,"yeah, i had so much hp that for me it wasn't worth, but for a lower hp build i can see it being worth the hassle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,gotta roll hehe puns with the punches and use what you got to your advantage.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"i think they made it feel a lot heavier, which is more realistic... but it makes it so much worse."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,i liked golfing though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-24,"don't even need the crest shield for that boss fight, just make a suicide run for the caduceus round shield from the graveyard right behind firelink shrine. it only has 65 mag resistance, but i find that and 5 estus more than enough to kill the moonlight butterfly."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,i bought this game. and then played it like 5 minutes. because spiders scare the living shit out of me. and that game right there had one of the ugliest and creepiest spiders i have ever seen in any game or movie. i'v gotten over the fact that every rpg for some reason needs to have big ass spiders dropping on you out of no where. i've survived the fat wobbly ones in vanguard and the disgustingly hairy ones in skyrim. but this game takes the cake. it's a ten on the spider creep scale. and so this game shall stay unfinished forever.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,this is amazing. way to be awesome in so many ways.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,that's sick!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,i once showed it to a girl and she just thought it was scary. i'll keep trying.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"limboico, yeah i'd play that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"this is the first time my wife has actually paid attention to reddit, she wants me to buy the game, repost on face book, and up vote you with the force of a thousand suns..... wonderfull drawing, can i use it as a desktop and claim it as my own?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,this game was wonderful and depressing at the same time. if you draw the two of you ripping the final leg off that spider i won't be able to tell if that's adorable or terrifying.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"saw this thread earlier and decided to give limbo a try. bought it, beat it, loved it. thanks for perking my curiosity!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,i made this my desktop background. 0

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,thank you for the new wallpaper
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,i am thoroughly enjoying your drawing. thank you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-16,"i just got limbo today since it was on sale, holy shit it's awesome which was kind of surprising for me as i'm not usually into the 2d side scrollers. pleasantly surprised and i would recommend it as a must have."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"my girlfriend is playing through this right now, so fun watching her! she's not a gamer but enjoying the hell out of this game. your work is wonderful!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,how... romantic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"limbo is one of my favorite games ever. the artwork is incredible, the gameplay is perfectly placed, dark, and yet humorous too. it is also a great game for people who aren't good at video games. my uncle almost beat it, and that is the first time in a long time he has been able to figure a game out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,is he leading you off screen to ravage you?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,love it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,this is so awesome and adorable. makes me miss drawing digitally d
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,that is incredibly sweet. print it and hang it up somewhere in your place. it's too nice not to.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"did limbo ever get cheaper? i want to play itbuy it, but they were asking 15 for a four hour indie game. no amount of artisticness is worth 15 for four hours. can i get it for 360 or ps3 for 10 or less? other than terraria for obvious reasons, i hate playing a 2d platformer style game without a game pad, so a pc version is a last resort."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,thats cute
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,i loved that game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,did you draw it on top of the screenshot?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,awesome! id love if you would share a high res version!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"anyway to get this into 1440x900, i'm seeing some serious desktop potential here."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,thats probably the one world i would not want to get stuck in with my boyfriend
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,you forgot the spider!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"ooh, coop in this would have been very interesting. nice drawingpainting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,rawr
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,this is a beautiful portrayal of an amazing game  very well done!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"that's adorable, you have a nice style and such."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,you know you could pass that off as a screenshot of limbo 2 and people would believe you. well done.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"the fact that the story of limbo is about a guy going around in an eternal loop, following his dead girlfriend to her grave which he may or may not have put her in makes this a bit creepier"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,this drawing is really going to make you sad after he leaves you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"you just gave me a new game to play with my gf, thanks!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,totally making this my android desktop
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,boyfriend  i boyfriend  me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,this makes me feel so much worse about my feeble attempt i made 2 years ago.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,when i played limbo my thougths kept going back to what dreams may come by richard matheson.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,i think you mean i and my boyfriend. that makes more sense.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"now draw you and he as you would be in the game catherine! it's a game about a relationship, a nightmare...and butt demons. ir's sort of messed up but the demo is free to download and it rocks!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"i don't think it's different enough to limbo's actual art to be interesting. to me, it seems kind of unoriginal. i'm obviously in the minority though, so don't be discouraged if you read this it's still good, otherwise you wouldn't be on the front page"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,boyfriend and me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,that would be the worst date ever...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,are you guys holding a ball?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"i only played the demo, but it seems you are going the wrong way."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,boyfriend and me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"i just saw this post yesterday, i loved the art style very well done, btw! so i looked into limbo a bit more and added it to my steam wishlist...and today it's on sale for 2.50! beautiful picture, i wouldn't have even considered looking into the game if it wasn't for this pic"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"awesome. do you, by chance, own a sitedeviantarttumblrwhatever? just wanna see more where that came from."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-19,hi! i love your drawing d i hope you don't mind if i use it as a stencil thing  i'm gonna make a christmas artsy gift for my boyfriend  we also play limbo together  just want to tell you because i might post the finished project up on rcrafts
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"love it so much! i love playing games, but this one i had to run through like 5 times just for the heck of it! i shall share this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,aww kind of reminds me of ico.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"it's funny but in your title your grammar is actually wrong, it should be me and my boyfriend in this special case. contrary to popular belief my friend and i is not always correct. the sentence should make sense when removing the second person, so here it would be i drew memyself exploring... not i drew i exploring..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,you're both freakishly short. really cool
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,me. very nice!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,this is so clearly a marketing post from the game dev. nice try limbo creators.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,shouldn't you two be more fat?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,you draw very well for an eight year old
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,imitating an already tired art style is less than art.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"it should say boyfriend and me, not boyfriend and i. braidpooplimbo. another dumb girl who doesn't know shit about games."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"theres always that risk, but i think having two players would be rather useful in some cases"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,thank you!! that game inspires me so much
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,it's a gorgeous way to go! seemed more fitting for limbo...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"agreed, op's work has inspired me to get this game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"in a program called painttool sai, i painted the background with the watercolor tool, then i used the pen tool to make the foreground the black parts. after all that, i exported it as a .psd. to get the shadowy, black glowy effect you see around the grass and us and the foreground in general, i made a duplicate layer of the foreground and used a filter called gaussian blur. it really gives it the limbo effect. i also gave it a little noise so it looked snowy in the background like the game 3"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"and she will draw you to be the brightest little firefly, in her jar."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,yes you will! and its gonna be so good.3
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,it helps that the game was exceedingly short.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,limbo was the only game my exgf finished during the years we were together. you could just see it in her eyes how proud she was. god damn it i miss her.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"its such an interesting game, i plan on playing it soon. although, id love to watch my boyfriend play it just as much."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"definitely. i hadn't touched a video game in about five years, and then one of my friends loaded up the starting screen and handed me a controller. i ended up playing it all in one sitting."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"i used to stay it was my favorite game this generation, but i'm pretty sure, perhaps like you, it's just my favorite in general. best part? it took only 15 people to make, and probably 1100th the budget of a blockbuster. i can't wait to see what playdead is cooking up next..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,dont tease me  i want that title so bad

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,thank you very much!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,i thought the spiders looked so much more realistic than any video game spider i've ever come across. i was actually scared of a video game spider for the first time in my life after playing limbo.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"yeah, sometimes i wonder about the people you saw die during the game or lead to their deaths. what happened to them? did they wake up somewhere else in the world like you did, or in an even darker, deeper, worse place than before? maybe they stopped existing, or continue to exist in the same spot as before, doing the same thing, unable to break the cycle of events that killed them. i wouldn't want any of the mystery explained, but i would wish that there had been more events in the background, more content, that raised questions and made you reflect."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"okay, i beat the game. wtf cliffhangers. still a great experience, although a bit short. i think it could've benefited from more creature interaction  that bit with the dog was great"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,indeed

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,either is correct. her way is incorrect.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"in this case, the reflexive pronoun myself should be used. as in i drew my boyfriend and myself.... had someone else done the drawing, then me would be ok chvor drew my boyfriend and me..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,i believe the correct usage would be i drew my boyfriend and i exploring limbo but 'boyfriend and myself' would probably be fine for most people.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-15,"it was 2.50 on steam a few weeks ago, and if you already have a 360 and a ps3 all you would have to do is plug a controller into your pc to play limbo with it. of course, this doesn't work if all of your controllers are wireless. steam has another big sale coming up on tuesday, so limbo will probably be around the same price then."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"actually, both are correct. though increasingly common, and more correct to many peoples' ears, the english language does not require the reflexive pronoun when the party being referred to has already been mentioned in the sentence."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-14,"what about the good old fashioned, my boyfriend and i? or have i been grammared wrong all these years?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-08,"hmm, just look at the age of many of the people that develop and write games. a significant number are in their 40s and 50s and are parents. they've played games for decades and still do...and of course, for each of those people there are countless others of a similar age that have played the games those developers created. everything from pong, through space invaders, doom and so on until today's games, team fortress 2 and so on. perhaps many adults have less time to sit and play games, it is, after all, more the case that young people have spare time, but i'm sure there are plenty of youngsters that don't play computer games, just as there are plenty of 40 and 50 somethings, if not older, that play computer games all the time. people like carmack and newell. even notch, at 33, is not exactly a youngster. as for this ability thing, years ago the media created this idea that kids were somehow computer whizzkids  farcical really, as kids we knew a bit, whereas our parents had never seen a computer. but we were anything but computer experts. today only the parents of dumb kids are dumb  that's how it works. there are myriad of highly intelligent, computer literate adults aged from 30 to 90 alive today. where do you think computers, windows and linux, the internet, playstations, xboxes, iphones and all the software that's been around for the past few decades came from? outer space? your average kid is no better at playing a computer game than your average adult is. of course, to get good at a particular game might take several thousand hours of concerted practise  at which point you might get some decent young or old players, but these, whatever their age, are always in the minority. chances are, whatever someone's age happens to be, they suck at playing games. it might have been the case when i was 11 that we were the first generation to own our own computers that we used primarily to play games. that is certainly not the case today."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-09,"well yes, but video games are arcade games  atari 2600 was released in 1977, you'd have been around 9 or 10. i owned a pong clone before that date, and then here in the uk the microcomputer market took off with zx81  zx spectrum  bbc micro et al having dominance  which most kids used to play games, hence eventually the computer  programming side of these machines disappeared and video game consoles started to be the in thing. but, i wouldn't consider that anything other than growing up playing video games. unless we're grown ups at 10 or going to the arcade didn't count? i remember going to a computer club every monday for the zx spectrum. i was a young teenager, but the place was full of adults too. the fact my parents took no interest didn't really reflect a generation gap as such. multiplayer gaming was playing in front of the same tv. admittedly my son's being playing games from the age of 2  at that age he started to read and one of the first things he read to me was 'loading please wait' off of a ps one loading screen  but i don't buy the idea here of anyone suggesting their parents haven't played computer games unless they are either around 40 themselves and they are talking about parents aged 60, or it's simply because their parents chose not to play games in spite of their wide availability when they were kids and teenagers. no one under 45 is part of a generation that didn't grow up with computers or games  and i think it goes older than that, we're both in our 40s, we're not saying ooh these new fangled smartphones are we? i own one, i bet you do, if not it's not because you didn't grow up with them is it?  when i'm 80 i might not be up to speed with the latest technology, but until then there's no great technology generation gap between me and my kids."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-22,"i actually liked that part. it was completely fucked up, but it said so much about the boy. and the world. he'd do anything to keep going stay alive. and that's how our world is, too. i know if i were in the kid's position i'd have done the same. the glowworm parts weren't nearly as bad for me. the glowworms seemed pretty harmless on their own it was all the crazy death traps they walked me into that were the problem!, but the spider was malicious. maybe i only say that because of how many times it killed me, but i always felt like it was really trying to kill me, whereas the glowworm was just kind of... there."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-16,"the level data and information is so readily available, i wouldn't really have to try too hard... i think the most difficult thing would be to get the visual effects simulated. it's one thing making a game look similar, it's entirely another ensuring it is playable"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-10,"yes, dreamscene, thank you. and that's a bummer...even though the pixels would be huge for most gifs"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"i thought the story was quite touching. i actually cried at the end, it was very powerful though abstract and open to interpretation. of course, that's not everyone's cup of tea. also, it was a 10 arcade title, it's not supposed to be more than 510 hours long. as for the challenge, i thought it was challenging enough to be rewarding. there were a couple of puzzles in particular that i got stuck on for a little while. and i never found all the hidden eggs  i don't think i even found half of them. if you really think it was too easy, try finding all of those things. or try to get the achievement where you beat the game in one sitting with 5 or less deaths or something like that, iirc. and, of course, the atmosphere. it was enchanting to many of us. clearly not you, but some people play video games for different reasons than others. atmosphere and immersion are two of the most important qualities in a video game for me. other people don't care as much about the game world itself, they care more about a specific, detailed plot, or just about the gameplay itself. obviously all of these are important factors to various degrees  i think the degrees change from game to game and person to person."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"it's unfortunate that you are so good at games that you missed out on appreciating a genuine work of art such as this because you found it too easy. indie games are one of the few places left in the industry where you can find truly creative and unique games. if you are really comparing limbo to call of duty and the like, then you really missed out on something  and just because you didn't see it, doesn't mean it wasn't there. i'm all for calling games out for being mindless commercial garbage, but only when it actually applies. i can't fathom how you could compare indie games with so much heart and soul to the hollowed out husk of modern fps franchises. oh well. p.s. if challenge is really this important to you, try fez. it's another indie puzzle platformer, and it's much, much harder than limbo. finishing it is pretty hard in itself, but 100ing it without any help is ridiculous."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,you keep praising this game as a work of art. games are not movies or pictures framed in a gallery. their appeal should be from interactive entertainment. if you only entertained by the graphics that is truly unfortunate. fez looks slow and the creator said it is a game to relax in. if i wanted to replay animal crossing i would chew a bullet right now. i can compare this idie game to the cod franchise because you sound like one of their fans. easily impressed by smoother graphics. not minding that it is just a reskinned game that has been developed thousands of times before. i am absolutely disgusted with the current gaming situation where 90's kids just want to relive their childhood instead of letting game development progress forward in a new direction. as long as gaming greenhorns keep giving money for this repetitive crap it will never change.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"even then, is pressing the arrow keys ignorant or moronic? i don't think so. i, too, felt the need to start moving him, because the mario start screen is just so iconic and engraved in many of our childhoods that this screen calls upon our muscle memory to hold b then a while continually running and grabbing the mushroom."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"there is a huge difference between smooth graphics and atmosphere. they are different concepts, but you are lumping them together. call of duty has smooth graphics. limbo has atmosphere. it's not just about how it looks. it's about how it feels  how you feel, as a character in the world the developers have created. and it takes much more than pretty graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. it's also about music and sound, about the layout and design of the world, about how the world reacts to you and your actions. of course it's all subjective, and not every person will enjoy every atmosphere, or feel the same level of connection to every world. i felt a strong connection to the limbo world, as did many others. that you did not is again unfortunate, but it doesn't mean limbo is a shallow game with no atmosphere  it just means you, specifically, did not connect with the atmosphere that it does have. which is fine. not every gamer has to like every game. i just think you are a giving limbo and other indie games way too little credit for what they are, and b overlooking and ignoring certain aspects of these games completely, just because you didn't like them. and it's not just about nostalgia. these games are far from rehashed ideas from our childhood. they are taking genres, styles and other elements from our childhood favorites, and doing new and interesting things with them. are indie platformers like super meat boy and dustforce nothing more than a way to relive our childhood just because they are platformers? is that all that you see in them? they have so much character and personality  and it's original personality. and they take one of the oldest gaming genres  platforming  and do new things with it. i've never played any other platformers that feel quite like they do, or have quite the same precision controls that they do. i know i'm banging my head against a brick wall, but i really love these games, and i felt the need to defend them. they give me hope that the future of gaming isn't going to be completely dominated by call of duty 27 and the like. and though i find your tone kind of condescending, i do genuinely wish you could see in these games what i do, because trust me, it's there, and it's a really rewarding experience. i like to share it with other people, so when i talk to someone who can't share it, it upsets me."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"sure. pretty graphics  atmosphere. atmosphere is subjective. indie games take elements from childhood favorites and do new things with them. you're never going to agree with me, but i still wish you could enjoy these games the way i do, because i enjoy sharing my love for them with other people which is also why i get so defensive when someone doesn't like them as much. the end."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,i'm not an elder lady looking over a family photo album every time i want to play games. i want to be mentally stimulated and have my reaction time tested when i play games. indie games fall flat of the classics because they keep you interested with progressive achievements and a reason to play. limbo got me interested with the spider and mysterious children. then it went completely silent story wise and ended with some girl he found. it explains nothing unless you want to reach and make your own conclusions. super meat boy became a repetitive pattern after you get used to the controls.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"i'm not an elder lady looking over a family photo album every time i want to play games. you once again completely miss the point. it's not just about how things look. i explained why in my long comment above so i'm not going to repeat it. super meat boy became a repetitive pattern after you get used to the controls. i'd like to know what games you actually do like, because it seems like you are above liking anything. you trash both popular titles like call of duty and indie titles alike. what is it that actually stimulates you?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"i want to be mentally stimulated and have my reaction time tested when i play games. oh, i see now. i know exactly what your problem is. you have a twisted perception on what the definition of a game really is. the way you see it, limbo and the likes are simply not games. this bothers me. why? well, i understand the idea of opinions. i also understand that they suck. what you're doing here, however, is not presenting your opinion. you are trying to find issues with a game, issues that make the game unplayable, based off of your idea of what a game is. your idea is false. every single point that nonbeing made helped support his argument. your argument, however, as i can now see, is nothing but the same attempt to prove to yourself that the game is bad because you don't like it. what pisses me off is not only your ignorance on the matter of gaming, but your insolence towards those in the indie game industry and towards the gaming community as a whole. i don't feel like i should waste any more of my time trying to prove you wrong, which you are, but i do hope that you see my point and understand the problem with your views. good day, sir."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"at one time these game types used to satisfy me, but as i mentioned. with the repetition of the same game types with little to no change in gameplay within the past decade i've spent gaming. there are no games that are not crap that i know of right now. also how can you say indie games take elements from childhood favorites and do new things with them. then take offense when i say that you are just trying to relive the past."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"good day, sir. what are you a twelve year old? got any other words in bold you want to throw at me? if you do respond at least bring reasoning to your claims. you wouldn't want to look like a jackass that spouts random nonsense like a youtube comment or a twitter feed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-09,"nonbeing provided all the reasoning for him and me being correct. i then proved this by giving the reasoning for why you were wrong. if you don't see this, maybe you should go back and read our responses again, and maybe you'll understand. and if it really matters, i am a teenager. one that obviously knows more than you about what to appreciate. to be honest, i'm surprised that you aren't my age, because it's from the people around me that i would expect such an idea such as yours."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,that game was not short
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,agree!! its short but its perfect length for such a game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,if you havent seen the short film version on youtube you absolutely should!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,game is hard in its own way. i honestly dont know if checking consistencies on paperwork can be fun but this got close to it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,for kolechia! ... the day was cut short by a terrorist attack.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,lucas pope only knows how to make bangers.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,cause no trouble
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,holy crap how long should this game be? i totally suck at it never finished it haha
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"came here to say this one. after years i finally played it, fell in love with it, and then went through the horror of disbelief that it was already over"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the factory level and the time skip level are still my two favorite levels of any fps campaign.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"at this point whenever i see this question, i just assume op is trying to gas this game up. game absolutely rips and deserves it but its pretty much guaranteed to be one of the top comments haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"in such a short time, you accomplish so much. and there's so many epic scenes. you go from lone survivor to the badass leading the charge in an all out war. beautiful game. not to mention that thumbs up!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,thanks for reminding me to replay this masterpiece!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,protocol 3 protect the pilot
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i keep hoping the sequel is coming out, probably my favorite of the telltale games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i will never look at this game's name the same way again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i don't remember that being very short, but it was an amazing game and concept. i wasn't familiar with the comics when i started playing it, so i just thought it was a cool take on fairy tales"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,forgot about this. great call! a game that no one should miss.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"the wolf what?httpsih1.redbubble.netimage.1952520077.3461raf,360x360,075,t,fafafaca443f4786.jpg"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,fucking loved the game. enjoyed the comics after that. was really sad when i learned the author is a straight up lunatic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,among us
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,among us lmao
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"made me read the entire comic, its really good"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i love how portal is both the top comment and the second top comment. correct answer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the cake is a lie!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,it's a must play game for anyone who likes detectivepuzzle games. i wouldn't define it as short though. although you may very well play through the game in one very long sitting because it's so hard to stop once you get started.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"one of my favorite games ever. took me about 12 hours to beat it, so i wouldnt really consider it a short game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i love that game and i'm too dumb for that game. cuz it is not short for me lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this game was so good i wish i could erase it from my memory and play it again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,its short if your literally a detective
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,for the love of god i've given this game three attempts and i can't get into it. i get so bloody confused after 15 minutes or so. what the hell is going on?? i feel like i'm missing a key element to make me play on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"try chants of sennar next, same type of thinking puzzles and only about 810hrs long"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i came here to say this. simply amazing. i think it took me about 12 hours and case of the golden idol which is similar and also excellent 8 hours
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,one of the best games i have ever played in my life.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,also known as shouting who the fuck are you at a man with tattoos for 10 hours simulator
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i read someone in the past saying that vice city was a short game. if you compare it to skyrim i suppose.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,yeah mario 64 was just a little too quick for me one hour is just too short for me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"similarly, abz. i remember finishing both and just wishing it could go on a little longer. some of the most memorable experiences in gaming for me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,'journey' is my answer anytime anyone ponders whether or not video games count as art. it is a beautiful game in every way
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,my forever answer to this question
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i was going to post this if nobody else had. short, simple, but somehow impactful. really great experience. i think it's the only game i ever got the platinum trophy on lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this deserves to be higher. what a fantastic game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i didn't see this but i commented the same thing with a period afterwards because man this game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i didnt get around to it until almost 10 years after release  successfully avoiding spoilers as recommended  and it still holds up as a very memorable experience.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,one i feel bad i couldn't get into.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this was way to far down the list.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"one of my fondest gaming memories is of journey. i was going for the achievement to play with someone through the story, i had found someone and we were jiving with our little sounds we could make. we always waited for each other, showed each other how to do things, it was amazing. i lost them right at the end of the last level in the clouds, i legitimately was almost crying, not because of the achievement but my buddy who i lost. i searched for a solid 15 minutes and eventually gave up, floating my way to the top. as im about to reach the pinnacle, there my buddy was, wedged in a corner. i spammed the hell out of the noise button in excitement, soon enough they started sounding off too! we then floated to the end together and i actually shed a tear. i never knew them and probably never will, but they were one of the greatest gaming partners i ever had."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,was going to say this myself. a third one is supposed to come out soon.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"beat me to it. i'd also like to add inside, limbo and forgotten anne to the list."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yep, i agree cause even with the dlc, both are still only like 5 hours long apiece"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"if you like those you should definitely check out bramble the mountain king too, amazing game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"just replayed it recently, decided to try for the secret ending. glad i used a walkthrough, ain't no way i would have found that cornfield entrance."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,yeah i came here to say limbo or inside but they should be in the same comment honestly
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,journey wow two great titles
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this would be my number one selection for best short game. never mind the fact its an overall great game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"my wife and i like to sit down with friends and see how they react to playing it. usually they can beat it in one sitting without help, but it's a crazy ride throughout. so mysterious and fun"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yeahh i was gona say this and limbo , short little treats . not sure why it took so long for playdead to make a successor. it was 13 years since limbo came out, so i was expecting inside to be a little longer tbh"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"there's a game called little kitty, big city coming out this year. similar vibes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,honk!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i bought that day one because it looked like the kind of dumb game i'd get amusement out of. wasn't expecting to actually have to do some logical thinking on how to achieve certain tasks. one of my favorite games to boot up and just mess around in. it's absurdly fun being an asshole goose just ruining peoples' days.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,correct answer! to the point that i wish they made a sequel with more customization and gameplay not only longer but more complicated but with same vibes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,one of my favotite endings of all time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,was searching for that comment. should be higher up!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,hjonk hjonk i love that game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,had me in stitches all the way through. getting the glass jar stuck on your head and giving it the echoing honk was a real treat!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the sequel also very good
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,the soundtrack was excellent as well.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i still visit oxenfree to this day. absolutely adored it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,fantastic game. the story was one of the best ive seen in games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i was just about say the same. still has one of the most fun gameplay and interesting world ive played
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"that reminds me, you can get catalyst for 3 on the playstation store till the end of the month. which... god damn. i get it kinda missed the point and impeccable flow of the first one. but 3 dollarinos? i had no idea it had bombed that badly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,why no one has made a similar game or created a totally cool genre out of it is beyond me. mirrors edge was the next gen game for me. it was the game that made the ps3 feel like it's truly the ps3 and not just an upgraded ps2.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"the atmosphere, the freerunning, the music. i've beaten this game 5 times and i'm down for another run."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"after mirror's edge most fp games just feel so empty. really droves home the floating hands feeling when you've experienced mirror's edge. even the ios companion game was great. still salty, that it doesn't work anymore... mobile gaming backwards compatibility sure is a mess  now by contrast... i never managed to finish mirror's edge 2. i burnt myself out on open world side missions and lost interest."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i loved the game. but ive never been so disappointed in an ending in my entire life lol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,was expecting this to be higher on the list! i was surprised it ended so quickly haha i think like 8hrs total play time but man were those 8hrs entertaining
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this game still sticks with me and i haven't played it since it came out. beautiful game and while it does get recognition i still feel like it's criminally underrated and underplayed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,came here to say this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,just 5 short years to 100.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the end is never the end is never the end is never the end
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"not to be super critical here but the parable doesnt belong to stanley, its simply called the stanley parable. i feel like thats an important distinction to make lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"in a similar vein, superliminal."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,unfunny??!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,now i need my !bucket!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,an absolute classic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"when stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i just bought the deluxe edition on the last steam sale. i had my doubts but seeing how high it was reviewed i gave it a shot. it is such a good game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i came in to say transistor, bastion is another great game too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i dig my hole you build a wall some day that wall is gonna fall mmmmhmmmmhmmmhmhmhmmmmmmmmm
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"isn't bastion meant to be replayed, though?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this was the first thing that came to my mind once i saw the post. i wish they made more games in the same world with the same narrator.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,came here for this. and also inside and limbo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,there's a sequel if you weren't aware
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yes. there is a second one. changing tides, i think"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"was looking for this one lmao, need to pick up the sequel sometime."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the bathtub scene was so sad when you realized what is happening.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,being a shark rolling down a hill is my favorite moment in video gaming history.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the cannery sequence is one of the most brilliant things ive ever seen in a game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,top of the crop for walking simulators. no extra crap to pad it out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"same vein, the vanishing of ethan carter"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,should be the top answer tbh maybe 2 hours to finish tops and yeah this was a fuckin experience lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"came here to say this. most indie games under 8 hours would work well in this thread, but what remains is probably the shortest yet most impactful experience ive ever played. absolute insane roller coaster of emotions, brilliant gameplay, story.. even includes a little reference to their previous game the unfinished swan which is also good. i didnt even realize they were the same creators until i saw that ref."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,cant believe i had to scroll so far for this one. its a game that has left a deep impact on me. i cant forget it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,all their stories were so sad but the big brother who worked at the tuna factory was so relatable with the maladaptive daydreaming this really is the young gen z in the workforce experience
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i never played all of it but the two levels i remember the best are the time travel one and the assembly line one. i should definitely finish this game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,that campaign is so good. i started it thinking it wouldn't be that interesting but it kept getting better and better. such memorable moments.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,jumping across the ships was awesome. i should replay it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,respawn heard people talking shit about 1s campaign and responded with a banger
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i finished it and wanted so so so much more. best fps campaign i've played since halo 2.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,traveling back and forth in time while fighting was awesome
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,add republic commando to it. this game was really great but when the credits rolled i was dafuq that's it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i'll piggyback and say force unleashed as well lol. i mean, at the time, it was unlike anything star wars had seen before. i talked about it to everyone"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,it's criminal that we never got a third game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,has it been long enough that people are now saying fu2 was good? cause that game was a steep downgrade from the first one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,force unleashed 2 sucked camel balls compared to the first
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,and inside. such great games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"whenever life becomes too stressful, i play a short hike"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,how in seven hells did i have to scroll this far to find someone listing this glittering gem?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i played through many of the games others have listed here, and i don't regret spending the money on them, they weren't wastes of time, but i'd have a hard time recommending them to others. a short hike is different though. it can be a short game, but it can also be a rabbit hole that steals you for long periods trying to uncover every hidden nuance and secret. and it functions just as well for a way to mindlessly kill some time and chill out. a short hike has a story, but it's a basic story and knowing the story doesn't ruin the fun inherant in just exploring it's interesting little island. secrets and easter eggs are hidden everywhere, and virtually every game mechanic and skill is combined and tested in unique and interesting ways. if you like cute relaxing games this one is a great option!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"been played sail forth, which has a similar feeltone. longer though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,want to add to the other comments that this game also has a really good soundtrack with some build up depending on where you are. really a beautiful little gem this one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,to the moon ending gives me a audible what the fuck while tears rolling cause dude
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,to the moon is amazing. i started the game at 11pm intending to play it for only an hour and ended up finishing the game in one sitting and going to bed at 23am
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,there is no game is great
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,yes. this is one of my favorite indie games. it's a masterpiece.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"wait, the people who made bastian and transistor made hades? how did i not know that lol. kind of obvious in hindsight too"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,very few games made me feel how gris did. that game is a beautiful piece of art.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i have never played a game that was so utterly stunning in every frame visually. truly a masterpiece.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,came here to say this. i beat it on the wii u.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"easily the most beautiful game i've ever played. create the most impressive hyperrealistic graphics all you want, there's no beating the utterly incredible art style this game has going on. it's fantastic how this game can tell such an universal, emotional story without a single word spoken or written. don't get me started on the ost, amazing compositions, couldn't be more fitting. an amazing and unforgettable experience, can't recommend it enough to anyone. the best counterpoint to anyone that argues that videogames can't be literal art."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the perfect slice of cozy and sweet and quality
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,donut county is fantastic. played it one day on a whim while stoned and thoroughly enjoyed the experience
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"fun game. got my daughter to also play it when she was 6. while i prefer a lot of the more melancholic games people have listed, this is a great option for those looking for something quick and silly"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i actually recently convinced my brother's girlfriend to play this! on her apple tv...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"donut county was such a neat little game. and like anything neat, you'll probably see an ad for mobile games that use the same hole mechanic, but it's just swallowing up random objects without context. not even dioramas, just food and bullets on a flat featureless plane, borderline artless in its execution."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,there is no other game that remotely feels the same and it's painful man
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,inside is even better in my opinion. both of those games are extremely solid
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i thought inside was a huge improvement!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"glad to see mark of the ninja mentioned! replayed it with developer commentary, it's such a masterpiece on so many levels. design choices, technical limitations, the way sound and vision works, every aspect of the game was made with so much love and expertise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,love that game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the answer i was looking for
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"this right here. love it, cried."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,... and it's getting a remake!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,my answer. one of the best moments in gaming imo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,had to scroll way to damn far to find it. by far my most recommended game. rarely have i cried whilst playing video games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"short, good, sad."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i cried twice in that game. truly excellent.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i hope that they make a sequel or dlc where our furball finally finds his friends.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"my four year old was watching me try it the first time and she started sobbing uncontrollably when the cat got separated from its friends at the beginning, i felt like shit"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,what a beautiful game stray was
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i miss that little fella. great game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,this game had no business being as good as it was!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i loved this game. didnt expect it at all. i rushed through it before it left gamepass.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i played it for 50 hours including the dlc lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i think some people can't get into it because they don't really hold your hand and walk you through on anything
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this. i wish i could forget it and play through it again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i honestly consider this the best game ever made, although the complexity of the control physics will likely cause casual gamers who aren't used to 3d navigation to bounce off. it's not a short game though. it's almost insulting to put it in that category. it's a long game for a puzzle game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i spent too much time in it for a short game and still have no idea how to finish it. at some point its just started to be annoying so i deleted it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,absolutely loved this game. the art is unreal and the story is enchanting.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"just played it yesterday morning, had an absolute blast, it's so unique."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i'll never have a girl like the adversary and that breaks my heart ...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,that game destroyed my soul.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"hifi rush is definitely one of the best games of last year, it was such an original and well made game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i am so ready for the sequel when it comes out
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,hard to believe i had to scroll this far.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this was my thought as well. 10 hour game and it was so intense from start to finish.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,excellent game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"came here to post this as well, aside from the short length that game fuckin slaps harder tham most fps of its time and partly to this day, you cannot convince me otherwise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"was looking for this post, while i can agree the game was great. the boss battles were very lacking, and idk if i was the only one but i had expectations of playing as the entire team. but yeah i wish it was longer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"it was unnecessarily panned for it's length, and as a result is now very underrated. i snagged it for like 6 years ago so the length didn't bother me, and it was one of the best experiences i had on ps4. excellent game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,you should def check out bound if you havent
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i used to fall asleep listening to a 6 hour loop of rain from odst. absolutely banger soundtrack
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this game is so much more than meets the eye. and like. i had no idea until i played it. and i only played it last year!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,and ill add delta rune chapters 1 and 2.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,granted that game can take forever depending on how you play. genocide run really does punish you by making you do endless grinding
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,so much good music packed into a 6hour silly and heartwarming game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i scrolled way too far to find this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,loved that game so much that i got the platinum which is very rare for me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,so innovative. being emotionally engaged by my own gamepad
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,zone of the enders is fantastic it was one of the few games i played on ps2 and i wish it got a remaster
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,scrolled way too far for this one. yes there is a ton of optional stuff to do. but the story itself is stupid short. even with the lost chapters added to it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,currently playing it takes two with my wife from the same dev and its really fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,one of my favorite indie games ever and one of my favorite games period in the last decade or so.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,sweet i picked this up after reaaally enjoying robocop.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"nah the length is pretty perfect, one of the most replayable games ever."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"agreed. took me a long time as a kid just because i didnt know how to progress yet and you couldnt just google everything at the time. on replay now, you realize how short it is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,starfox 64!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,every metroid game is a valid answer to this question tbh. theyre so short that many of them actively encourage you to play again with a faster time. theyre some of the funnest games to speedrun for that reason.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,loved it. just wish it had some semblance of replayability. there arent even save nyc missions to select once you finish it please tell me im missing something
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,amazing game but i don't think it qualifies as short. miles morales maybe.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i really loved playing scorn with a group of friends, passing the controller when we got stuck or annoyed. never would have gotten through it alone though. if it had just cut most of the combat, or made it more like the genuinely good boss fight, it would have been much better imo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,amazing game but not really short though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i was searching for someone else with the same opinion. that game is on my top 3 because of just how great it is with so little gameplay
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,not short.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,not a short game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"the soundtrack and ambiance of the first game were phenomenal. the nautical theme really set it apart from other games for me as well. i remember reading an interview with the lead sound guy who was detailing the overall direction for sound design in the first game. they wanted to use musical instruments in as much of the background world ambiance as possible. the creeking, groaning and sighs of the maw was all done with instruments to further develop the feeling of being someplace entirely separate from the everyday world. i think they did a fantastic job with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,wanted to say this but i wouldnt really categorize it as short
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,yep it was super fun and a great twist on the monster genre.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,came to add this! loved this game sm !
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,the music too. lovely game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"ill say callisto protocol. people dog on that game way too hard. its fair to criticize the short story and the high price but i feel like those provided a perfect avenue into an absolute bandwagon of unjustified hate. the game was fun, the game was spooky. good voice acting, good pacing. i mean it was a solidly good horror experience that got overshadowed by a rocky launch next to the dead space remake. i think if they launched at 29.99 nobody would have complained at all. with every criticism there would be someone saying yeah well its a short game and its not like theyre charging next gen prices."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,a coop puzzle in portal 2 had me like that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i wouldnt call portal 2 short tho
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,portal 2 has a vr mod and it's the most fun i've had in vr here recently
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"portal 1 was your first kiss. portal 2 was like french kissing. better, but not nearly as special."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,idk. i like portal 2 even more. j k simmons added a lot of character to cave and i really enjoyed exploring the history of the place
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,the orange box was a brilliant way to get people to install steam.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,dan da dan dan da dan dan da dan dan dadun dan dan

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,greatest country proud!!!!! o7
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i played the whole thing through before i realized it was matthew mercer doing the voice for jack cooper.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i recently met someone that works for the studio that made titanfall. he told me they were working on titanfall 3 but stopped i think he said for the jedi game. but he said they will likely make a 3rd eventually
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i played the game for the very first time just last week. on the time warp level, once i figured out what the mechanic was i was blown away. then i blasted a soldier point blank in the past timeline, warped to the present timeline, and saw his aged and decayed skeleton fall to the ground. that was the first time in probably 10 years a game has made me audibly gasp in disbelief at how fucking cool a mechanic was. later on you essentially end up playing two maps at once, each with a different set of enemies, warping back and forth between them as you move around and manage each fight at the same time. it's absolute genius game design, they executed it perfectly, and no other games offers an experience like it. honestly that time warp level might be the 1 moment in any single player fps i've ever played."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i absolutely loved those parts of the campaign. the time wrist watch thing was a fresh new gameplay mechanic that didn't get old the entire time we used it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,supposed to be this year!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"you can always read the fable comics, they're pretty good"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i can't take it anymore
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,hahaha he said the thing
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,even though it was real
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i beat it in one sitting but honestly think i would've enjoyed it more if i had done it instead in a couple different sessions. i was procrastinating some stuff so that also took a toll lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,12 hours used to definitely be a short game. most things i played were about 80 hrs and no dlcs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"you and me both pal. i thought i was doing great till i was asked to name all the background characters that aren't mentioned, then realized i was screwed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"chants of sennaar is currently scratching my obra dinn itch, and its really good!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,it took me longer than usual to finish limbo by playdead.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,try jusant. it is the closest thing to journey in vibe ive played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yep, abzu a lot. and flower in fact, tons of exploration games aer memories of old, alba, a short hike, etc"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,one of the most beautiful and cinematic games i've ever played. the range of emotions that game took me through in a 2 hour playtime is wild.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i recently played jusant and it is really close to journey in vibe
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,sadly the third one is made by a different studio and is focusing on co op. co op doesn't mean it will be bad but it's never been a good sign
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,man the dlc for the first little nightmares had me fd up when playing it for the first time
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"oh gosh, thanks for letting me know! wishlisted now 3"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,there's a sequel? sigh.... there goes my sleep again...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"and the music oh my goddd, still alive is still one of my favourite tracks ever"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"its fine, just fine. its not terrible but i prefer the original. i will go back though catalyst though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"in fairness, they did just take the servers down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i think part of it was how long the hype built up with the fans then the game came out and there was no way for it to live up to the expectations.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i feel that was the point of the game. the protagonist is escaping the depressing reality of his life back home. but he is living a fantasy. rather than facing up to his problem, he runs away and uses his time as a firewatch to delve into uncovering an imagined grand conspiracy, only for the ending to come and reveal that !its just another sad reality of a previous firewatch who also couldnt face up to his problems feeling responsible for his son dying in the cave! the same applies to the chemistry and flirting between you and the other firewatch, she has her own problems that arent clearly revealed to you but in the end !she basically tells you it could never work out and you need to go home! its a game about the dangers of running away from responsibilities."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i always thought the ending being so anticlimactic was kind of the point of it. like there is no crazy axe murderer, it's just a sad dude that mirrors the protagonist really well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i was waiting for some kind of big twist or revelation but instead it just abruptly ended haha
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i loved the ending. i felt so empty and melancholy for days.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i liked the ending. a bit soul crushing. maybe im just a little masochistic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the ending was great! perfect choice of music too  gets me all emotional just thinking about it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i think the remake doubled it to 10
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"heh, i passed the 5year mark some time ago. i should really log in to get the achievement"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"honestly, that scene kinda fucked me up. i was legit feeling bad for the narrator. i began to search the room for anything to do but pushing that button. even listening to his rambling to see if something happens after some amount of time but to no avail. you have to push it. that absolute silence at the end gave me insane chills."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,is never the end is loading is never the end is never
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,empire's strike back
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"maybe i'm just slow, but i wouldn't consider those short"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"lewis' scene actually hit harder for me. poor dude just getting more and more lost in his own imagination. maladaptive daydreaming is a wild thing. but yeah, gregory was a tough one, too  probably moreso for people with children"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i played this with my wife she watched as i played and i warned her about it in advance since i had heard about the situation before playing and we were still at a loss. it was difficult to get through, especially because we were in the situation ourselves not the whole bad situation, just the set up to the bad stuffshitty explanation but i dont want to spoil anything."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"the suicide of rachel foster is another great game with five words in the title, two of which are a person's name."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,you definitely should. it's very short but very very good. you could easily beat it in a day.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"that's one of the things they did best. making the campaign start off as just okay. first level you're a standard grunt, no double jump, no power slide, no titan. followed by a standard fetch quest. map familiarizing you with the mechanics. then the campaign just gets better, and better, and better."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"really? i played that game in my early teens and i remember it being so long. but there were a lot of memorable scenes, which might make it seem longer in retrospect"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this one. republic commando is a fantastic gem of a game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i mean, you're running around as vaders apprentice ffs! or domsday if you watched smallville"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"also played cocoon recently, made by the same guy. really neat puzzle game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yep, wish there was more to it. i still just climb the mountain then enjoy gliding down. and aer memories of old is another one love just being an eagle and flying around and wish there was more game to do things"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,exactly!!! this is the actual short game and one that is absolutely wonderful
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,for river is such an insane song
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,supergiant has a great portfolio of games for sure!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"fret not, the dlc is... coming, probably... i think? i hope."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,third game will be out shortly before china becomes a democracy and fusion power exists in albania.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,it's one of the few games i took the time to 100. that one and hades really stand out!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,that part where you phantom trigger the other brother to avoid drowning. the feels.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"some guy in ytube made calculations for entire map  and looks like our little hero goes outside almost in same place, where they was chilling originally. so, with high chances, when he got out and moved to the right  he already found his friends and went to them. i hope this will make your live a little bit happier today"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,that ending... i was like nooooo i need more
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"im a 38 year old man, and it got to me too. i had to turn the game off and come back to it later"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"same lol, it's only a short game if you already beat it lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,excellent game but i don't think it qualifies as short.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i finally played it last week and went in entirely blind after hearing someone complain that it's a shit game where there is no way to know what to do. just talk to people and read the letters on the screen holy they give so many hints, and it's so much more satisfying to piece things together yourself. hell even if you spam through everything you can read a neat summary with the relevant info back later"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,i should try again..but i had a hard time figuring out how to pilotland properlyand would always enter a red alert i couldnt stop. and i just get punished with that alarm nonstop until i die. ive never played a flying sim or anything with those kind of controlsand they seem barely explained and really awkward. happened the first 3 times i went to spaceand it was the most unpleasant least relaxing think ever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"not sure if you know, the release date was announced to be 21.5.2024."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,plus it looked absolutely amazing graphic wise at the time. i was floored by it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,very much agree. also bought it for less than 10 and its one of my favorite ps4 games. still looks fantastic even next to current gen games imo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"other than the side missions and fighting the random symbiote monsters thats it sadly, i literally reinstalled sm1 and mm just to have some more spiderman content to play"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yeah it isn't perfect in terms of combat, but it's a gross and beautiful game of art. i enjoyed the puzzles and lack of instruction"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"especially not in vr, godamn does it feel long sometimes with vr on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"that was me and my ex on the one where you had to fly into the air to hit each other. took us like 3 hours to figure it out. we were so pissed, that we just broke up right then and there"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i was a proud father the days that my sons and i completed portal 2 coop  which included intentionally destroying each other for laughs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,that would make me crazy dizzy and nauseous
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i gotta go jerk off now
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"you must not be very good at frenching, cause whoahohoboy"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i went all the way to this morning without knowing that. very cool, thanks. will make my next playthrough that much better"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"hes gotta be my favorite va. his voice is just so smooth. cassidy in ow, chrom from fire emblem, jotaro kujo, all great"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,devastating news. it's gonna have a tough time against portal 3 for goty
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"they stopped for apex legends. respawn completely abandoned the titanfall ip. they literally renamed the titanfall universe that apex was based in, to the apex legends universe"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"the jedi games are great, love to get more of those but nothing really scratches the same itch that titanfall 2 did. i feel like now, with apex legends bringing more attention to the ip, would be a great time to make a titanfall 3."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"alright, you got me. i'm play tf2 for the first time instead of apex."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"when the explosion freezes in time at the very end, that could be its own art piece."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i had the exact same reaction, it was mindblowing how it never bugged out either. i can fathom how it was coded but it was a very polished experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,not the first game to try the concept but one of the best to do it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"in fact, i think it under stayed its welcome."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i just played it for the first time recently and when the time travel shenanigans began i kinda laughed and rolled my eyes. then i quickly fell in love and audibly said this is fucking fantastic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i thought telltale went belly up
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this was a triumph!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,my son's excited though. he watched me play the first two because he was too scared to play solo so a coop ln should be a good time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i was really worried at first but you can also play solo, the other character just gets controlled by an ai. so hopefully it will be a similar experience to little nightmares 2."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"honestly the sequel was very disappointing, i loved oxenfree and completed it multiple times but oxenfree 2 was just much more boring and the conversations are much more shallow than the first."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,that music when you start the last level... just looked it up  the shard puzzle. wow.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,howd i forget?? i think my favorite track has to be kate. it immediately takes me back to better days. the only bad thing about it is that ill never be able to find another soundtrack like it. or game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i think we all do. it was a tight experience with 0 filler. one could argue that catalyst is mostly filler. but i had a fun time with it none the less. i did feel it took itself a little too seriously for a story that boils down to xtreme door dashers vs amazon.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"wait... but you can still play offline, yes?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i believe that's really it. i think the other firewatch even says that you must have some problems to be there. and as mysterious as the events happening were, they were really just the event of another broken person. the game opens up with what your character went through already, and at one point you would have to return to it. disappointing but it was just a way for the characters to escape, even if for a brief time, and after it becomes unfeasible they just stop."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"the first time i played that game, i hated the ending. when i played it years later, after having tried to ignore and run from the problems in my own life, it just wrecked me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,"i loved the ending for most of the reasons you described, and delilah's disposition was critical after all the two of you had seen and done, why would she want anything to do with you? you don't really know each other and you'd be forever entwined !by the corpse of a dead boy!. there were hints throughout the game that she was a struggling, complicated person and the playable character has to figure his own shit out. !so that's what they do!. it was depressing but brilliant and believable imo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yeah. i think it's disappointing because henry himself is kind of disappointed. disappointed that there's no big secret conspiracy against them, that he never got to see delilah, and that now he must go back and face his problems head on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,exactly this. it's a good down to earth game that reminds us that sometimes the truth is just something sad not scary.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,this. the anticlimax was absolutely the point.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,yea exactly
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"hard agree! i loved the ending. people usually complain about how the mystery plays out but i enjoy how grounded in reality it ended up being. which is exactly what henry and delilah was avoiding doing. the games story was centered on henry, not the forests mystery."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,oh shit i better get started.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,the empire's on strike again?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"transistor 100 was a relatively short game, but thats compared to the grindfest rpgs i usually do. it was an epic experience and fun from start to finish though, and thats rare."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,yeah they weren't like triple a length games but bastion definitely isn't a you could beat this in one session game. especially if you tried to do everything.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,took me around half a day for the first time. i played it over and over again. i loved this game so much and was so hoping for a sequel that never came. there is a remastered for ps4 or 5 not sure but not for pc.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"i was just blowing away, at the time, by the complexity of the lightsaber battling and the force power tree. it was so cool to learn new skills as the game went on, and then those skills were implemented perfectly. i mean, to be able to lift someone with the force and throw your lightsaber at them or throw them into a pit? i think we take those mechanics for granted nowadays, but in the early 2000s it was unheard of. plus, i thought it was cool as hell to battle all the rancor"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-24,still the most meaningful button press i think ive ever made. maybe tied with firing the second portal at the night sky
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"yes, that scene hit me pretty hard too  but it was nothing compared to the feeling of having to say goodbye to b12 in the control room q.q"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,39 when i played it. it took me like 3 weeks to get back to it after cat falls off
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"right? if you read the first clue in the museum in the very beginning that's enough of a thread to send you on your way. some of the puzzles were challenging and made you think outside the box a little bit, but i never felt aimless or like i didn't know where to go. if you read your ship log you'll always have something to investigate. like, it literally even tells you there's more to explore here."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"still holds up really well, played it again maybe about a year or so ago, and was blown away at how well it still plays."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"but like, we cant even replay the side missions just gotta randomly swing around and hope to find enemies? lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,at least you still have the companion cube.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,you legit broke up then??
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"this onehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vtgbmkurxx7c took me about an hour. still no idea how i did it. just keep doing things and eventually it'll happen, but in my head there is no solution."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,that's the stanley parable
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"how can anyone be bad at it? the rules are simple. you just stick your tongue in another person's mouth and start whipping it around in circles as fast you can. the more rpms you get up to, the more points you score. if you are able to get get your opponent to give up, you get to twist hisher nipple. i'm currently undefeated and no one has been confident enough for a rematch. so, i would say i'm pretty damn awesome at it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,he's kind of a chameleon. i was in the middle of listening to the first vox machina campaign when i played titanfall 2 and it still didn't hit me until the credits and i saw his name.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,even his rendition of leon kennedy was solid
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,im not saying its for sure coming out but the dev i met said it likely will eventually
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"half life 3 gonna win it, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,the servers for titanfall2 multiplayerat least for playstation were unexpectedly brought back online sept 2023. sony also dropped the price for tf2 ultimate edition to 5. its been a lot of fun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,thats what i said to him and he told me that wasnt entirely true. he was a dev there. i have no idea how true this is just what he said. he def wasnt a decision maker at the company
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"it's a great experience, lighthearted and heartwarming story about a boy and his bot."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i don't even play many fps games but i can safely say titanfall 2 really does live up to thy hype. still remember the campaign fondly years later
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"you're correct, but they were then bought up along with their ip and continued making one or two of their properties. the wolf among us being one of them"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i'm making a note here.. huge success
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,"while it definitely wasnt as good as the first game, i still really enjoyed the sequel and the narrative it told."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,i forgot the sequel even came out. it's so un talked about so i'm assuming it's mediocre rather than extremely bad or good. what's funny is i watched the original be played and bought afterparty expecting a wild ride only to be extremely disappointed. so hearing it didn't do well doesn't surprise me actually? now i wonder if the sequel had an arg like the first
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-23,yeah im going to go into catalyst without all the expectations i had originally and just play it for the fun parkour. i think i will like that!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i have quite a few. the persona games feel completely different after the first run if you aren't that fond of the battles you'll be leaving the game after some minutes. the series leans so much on character development and psychology that it's hard to start the development again. spec ops the line is just so brutal that the best way to experience it is not playing again. it leaves such an astonishing feeling in you that you'll be better off leaving it there. short indie games like venba or a short hike are so story dependant that there's just no replayability. i enjoyed both of them but i won't be returning to them soon. visual novels like ace attorney are also very hard to replay due to the gameplay being almost nonexistant. ddlc is another example that follows the same path as spec ops the first experience is just unforgettable. portal is a special case because the main story has a somewhat bad replayability. however, there's so much community content being released nowadays that you can pretty much find new games based on portal."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i wouldnt say one of the best, but i had a good time playing dungeon encounters. its kind of mindless. during the pandemic i probably spent a good 50 hours on that game before i went crosseyed. however, im in no rush to try it again. maybe someday if we move or i have a long flight and i bring my switch. for those who havent played it, its a cute little square enix title thats unlike anything ive ever played. it uses the old school turned based attack system from the early ff titles, as you dungeon crawl down 99 floors that look like crossword puzzles. different squares have different bonuses or enemies, and you gain skills throughout that will allow you to teleport and other things. i enjoyed making my party and getting the hang of it. the only thing though is that once you pass the learning curve and get yourself set up, it becomes extremely repetitive, so the only thing youre doing it trudging to the end. and if you ever have the severe misfortune of falling through a trap door hidden squares on the crossword floor that your party is scattered throughout the world, and it takes forever to find them. ya may as well just start over. in true squaresoft fashion, the latemiddle and end game reminds me of playing ff8 or ff9 where grinding and exploiting parts of the game for hours is just part of your homework to beat the final boss. dungeon encounters by floor 70ish really does just feel like youre running back and forth outside to grind monsters so you can lv up. i would definitely recommend the game to try out, especially if you like singleplayer games that require a pen and paper. its very cerebral and harkens back to games my uncle used to play on ms dos with barebones graphics. the real game is happening in your imagination. requires you to keep a diary as youre going so you remember where things are, and write out your goals. . actually, now that i think about it, i wish i had more free time cause i might try busting that out again haha."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,full throttle. not so interesting when you remember all the interactions. still a classic back from the good old lucasarts days
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"for me a few spring to mind. the first two are old action adventure games called day of the tentacle, and full throttle both have remastered versions i believe and both are from the dos era. i replayed both of them a year or 2 ago and i still remembered to much even after like 20 years so i could just breeze through them, still fun though. if you've never played them and are in to adventure gamessidescrollers.. play em! a more recent one is brothers a tale of 2 sons. i got it for free somehow and it didn't seem that appealing to me at the time. gave it a try and wasn't to convinced within the first 30min or so. still ended getting totally sucked in and ended it in 1 run. unfortunately it's very short but its also very cheap. even though the graphics aren't top notch the game's art, game play, and story all felt very beautiful. do need a controller though and that's a downside. another game in a slightly different category is cult of the lamb. i thought it was very funny and well executed... just kidding, i've been fully brainwashed into worshiping my woolly overlord. its mainly a hack and slash with a little settlement building and a dose of diabolical cuteness. subnautica is also high on my list and while some might argue that it has some replayability, for me the magic of discovering everything and dealing with encounters just disappeared after i got to know them the first time around. its a first person open world survivalcraft ish game. systemshock 2, and bioshock 12 are honerable mentions for as far as shooters with rpg elements go. all of em already a bit older but the only ones besides the deus ex the old one and human revolution mainly series that managed to reserve a spot in the fond memories section of my brain. a final and honorable mention is the entire homeworld series including 1, 2, and desserts of kharak. they are rts games and each of them has a multiplayer option which should give them a replayability score but realistically there aren't many people playing it online so the campaigns or vs ai are what you'll be doing. campaigns are more than worth it though."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"shadow of war. incredible game. even has a great postgame metawar that lets you keep playing and building up your armies and competing with other players, invading their fortresses as they invade yours, matching your armies and your skill against their defenders and vice versa. and yet... no ng, only one save file. if you want to play through a game a second time, from scratch, you must delete your existing save file and lose the armies you've surely spent a great deal of effort building up. sure, you could back up the save to the cloud  but by the time you've played through the entire game again, you'll have effectively built up a second army, only to now throw that one away to go back to your original. which i suppose is the whole idea, and functionally identical to what you'd do if there was a second save slot, but still. it's a rather tedious process that, for me at least, sucks the joy out of trying to return to the game for another play through."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i once heard someone reviewing the game say i can't wait till i get dementia just to that i can experience the feeling of playing this game for again for the first time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ive been playing games for almost 30 years and outer wilds is easily one of my favourites. in my opinion it is a game designed for people who are passionate about video gaming as a medium. it has very few mechanics to distract you from what is the core of almost all video games empowerment via discovery. after the start of the game, you dont progress because you got enough points, or were given a new weapon, power up other macguffin. you progress because you learned something, and then applied what you learned. its a game i actually think they should have kids play in school, because the feeling of empowerment you get from learning and applying is something i wished i felt when i was studying, and only have now im a little older, and have to seek out learning myself."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"actually, i think right around now there is a lot of things i don't remember the specifics of. if i were to start a brand new run right now, i would have to do a little digging to remember how to get the code needed to finish the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,this was gonna be my answer too. its my favorite game and im never gonna play it again. i just keep looking for blind play throughs on youtube.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i was about to say this lol. it took me 30 hours to finish it and i went in completely blind. it took me a while to figure out what to do and how to do it properly and to also start processing the information i was reading because every little piece of dialogue is important. i also stuffed around a bunch and one of the first things i done was land on the sun station. unfortunately i had to search one small little thing up because it was obscure and i done it, but not good enough for the game to register it. but it didnt ruin the experience. it was towards the end of the game. best game ever though, and i cant wait to play the dlc. i also might play it again and see how fast i can do it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"to be fair, isn't it technically restarting every 20 minutes or whatever the cycle is? so in 24 hours, you actually replayed it 71 times after the first playthrough thats some serious replayability if you ask me!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,id add return of the obra dinn to this list as well. though i feel like theres replayability based on how long its been between sessions of the game. i feel like obra dinn and to a certain extent outer wilds can be replayed if youve forgotten some of the puzzles in between. but i feel your answer. theres nothing like the immense satisfaction of rediscovering the aha moment you had when you arrived at the solution to some of the puzzles

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"well it's still fun to try other character builds on ow. play pure melee, pure ranged, pacifist, etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"outer wilds is like this sub's favorite game of all time...i just couldn't be bothered...it's a walking simulator, and if that's your thing, i get it, but come on...greatest game? it's just a puzzle in a solar system dealing with gravity...very very basic stuff that is overly praised as some revolution"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i played it on release, and while i kind of vaguely remember the idea of what i need to do to finish it, i'm pretty sure i'd struggle to actually get to the end game on first run. what this means is, my shitty memory means that i get to experience the game all over again! i've forgotten enough that i could probably complete it faster than a total noob, but would still have to legitimately solve all the puzzles and do all the exploration again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"this is true of a lot of great puzzle games too. the games are amazing, but once you know the solutions to puzzles, you can fly through them in no time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i haven't had a major brain injury but i remember very little of what i'm supposed to do to finish that game i'd have to play it almost from scratch again, which i will do eventually!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"one of the best games ive ever played. but yeah, cant play it again. wish they have more like it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i know i will never have the chunks of time with a non tired brain to play this game. can anyone suggest a good lets play?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i haven't had a major brain injury but it had been several years since i played it the first time. i think i might have forgotten enough to replay it again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,".whaaaa wait what? i started it awhile ago picked up from the library. since i got it at the library i did no further research, 15 minutes in i was like meh its cool but seemed to lag. now reading these comments, i guess there is still something i dont know but what i do know is im going back to the library to borrow and play it again!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i've heard people say this about a lot of games, but this game is really the only one i wish i could forget so i can play it again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i came here just for outer wilds. my favorite game of all time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,massiveheadwound harry has entered the chat
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,so happy to see this at the top. this question was written for outer wilds.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i have considered trying to acquire a major brain injury just to experience it again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,my first thought too. i wish so much i could reset my memory of this game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,absolutely. metroidbrania where your collectibles stay with you forever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"100. you can play it with mods and so on but the original game is so amazing, but once you learn everything you can basically jump right to the end so you can't get that initial experience again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i just started this game actually and am finding it such a great dive. i spent an entire damn day in a planet rosewood? or something just doing all the side quests and exploring lmao. great game for sure
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,replaying it might be possible in a few decades. hopefully we'll have forgotten by then. it'd be really confusing for the newer games then to see a decades old game blowing up out of nowhere.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,it's frustrating to not be able to play it again because it was so great
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,literally the first game that popped into my mind
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,probably my favorite gameplay experience of all time. cant wait for my kids to be grown enough to appreciate it so i can experience it again through their eyes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i think the puzzles are complicated enough that if you wait a year or two you can replay it. i finished it about a year ago, couldnt solve a single death from memory now"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,my first answer and i came looking for this post. man what a ride. confession i guessed on quite a few.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,ive replayed it just because its the only game that looks like that. i love the graphicssound design. i would love another game like that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i loveeeee this game so much
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"same! zero replay value, but a great experience. i'd argue that games like firewatch do have replay value since the experience is still there alternative dialogue choices, admiring the graphics, etc. return of the obra dinn, on the other hand, has gameplay entirely grounded in problem solving. once you know all the tricks, there's no gameplay anymore."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i've replayed it a few times. it's really not that bad, relative to some other games like it. it's really easy to figure out who killed who, the hardest part is figuring out what their names are. and there's really no way you'll remember that, minus a few of the more obvious ones. for example, one of the characters is killed as revenge, because, you killed my brother. okay... who's the brother? it's super easy to figure out who the two brothers are, but which one is which? which one was killed, and how did he even die? i don't even know what the brother looked like! and i have zero idea who this other guy is! it's really easy to guess in this games, too. your deaths are only confirmed when you've got 3 correct. so there's always a possibility that you didn't understand why a particular death was right, and you could potentially figure it out on the second playthrough."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that's a pretty long session. i think my full playthrough took around 5 hours? i finished it within a few days but still a bit of a grind to get out all at once.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,tbf you can choose to spend the day with different people to get a new bit of story in the middle and i think on a 2nd play through it's fun to see stuff that points to what happens that you missed before
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"if you play any girl's route and then load before the festival starts again and play another girl's route, at the end you get the secret ending. so, i guess it is worth playing once with each girl."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,when does anything interesting happen? i got like an hour in and it was still just a visual novel talking about poetry.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i had a magical experience when i was steaming this and someone from chat made an account on both discord and twitch pretending to be monika and messing with everyone xd
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"the correct replay is going online and look at all the wild, well made stuff you missed and wouldve never even gotten close to discover by yourself d"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i was excited for their next game, and then i looked at the anticipated release date of 2029, and i was no longer excited."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,first thing that came to mind for me. once the storys conclusion is revealed it loses its charm on a second play through. still one of the best games ive ever played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,that atmosphere is probably the most phenomenonal one and it does it with a fairly lowres aesthetic too! i mean the colors used for nature fit so well with the outdoor equipment aesthetic for the era look up the toyota tacoma or toyota hilux from that era and checkout the paint jobs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"and the ending fucking sucked, in my opinion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the voice acting for this game is out of this world
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's not bad if your memory is terrible and you're showing someone the game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"same with gone home for me, for the same reasons."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"firewatch is great, i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes atmospheric games not heavily reliant on gameplay"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"felt the same when i finished firewatch.. it was incredible to say the least. the years after i did think about replaying it, but i couldn't ruin my first impression and experience.. just not worth it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"agreed. its not even really a game, its more an interactive movie"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i haven't played it for long enough that i could probably do it again. i've thought about it a few times but i just have so many other games i haven't given it another go.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,supernatural vibe? think we played different games  murder mysterymaybe a little intense. also don't knock the audio tour it was quite interesting plus more trophies  achievements to unlock.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i have conflicted feelings on this game because i can see a lot of excellent qualities put into the making of it but at the same time i watched someone play through it on youtube and then felt like i got the same experience as if i had sat down and played it myself. it wasn't really a game to me at that point it was a movie, but it was being sold as a game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,unless you're me and play these in a single day. i was able to replay the ace attorney series with mostly a goldfish brain because i didn't remember the story since i blazed through it. for some cases i remembered the murderer but couldn't remember how they did it. for other cases i thought i knew the murderer but was completely wrong. then other cases i had no fucking idea what was going on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it sucks cuz i really loved danganronpa 2 and v3, but replaying them just to get some different dialogues with characters i didn't interact with on my first playthrough just feels like.. a waste of time? it's like rewatching a 100 episode anime where there's nothing but dialogue. i remember the characters, i remember the plot. what newfound enjoyment could i possibly get from it?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the main problem with games like these are that the stories they tell are incredible but they're difficult to play again because the gameplay is predicated on you unraveling a mystery. it's like reading a detective novel a second time, you know all the answers so all you can do is appreciate the structure and foreshadowing. the best way to try and relive them yourself is to...watch a friend or youtuber go through it themselves. this also makes them hard to talk about to anybody who hasn't finished them beginning to end. they have niche communities but bringing new people into them is a big ask, especially with games like aa and danganronpa that have a lot of story to get through in a linear fashion. ace attorney, danganronpa, zero escape, and now recently master detective archives are all great adventure games that people should give a try, but they're hard to talk about beyond hey, you should try it because then you're giving too much away."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"anything with decent story and mediocre gameplay i'd say. visual novels are just epitome. you can only really experience the plot twist once. i would add zero escape series especially virtue's last reward to the list. lame escape rooms that hardly even contribute to the world building, but great experience otherwise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i'm actually replaying ace attorney now, but like ... fifteen years after i first played it, maybe more. i remember quite a few of the murderers, but not the details, so it's revisiting something very nostalgic for me, because it's about the characters and story for me. i could see how a danganronpa would be less satisfying second time around, though, where the mystery is the key element of the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"only reason to play them again is for different routes. but then again, also depends on what kind of visual novel you're playing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"your last sentence is why many point and click or text control adventures, especially older ones from the '80s and '90s, have little to zero replay value for subsequent playthroughs after you beat them. most of the fun associated with them comes from trying to figure out the solution to the puzzles, and that is kind of gone once you know what to do. some games might be worth coming back for the humor, such as sam and max. sierra figured out this would be a problem back in the day, and some of their old police quest and space quest games had a points counter for certain actions and tasks you accomplished, say a total of 300. you could finish a game without hitting 300 points, so if you wanted to get that total, you had to figure out all those noncritical tasks or optional tasks that were not needed to finish the game. imo, trying to figure out those little things wasn't enough for me to go through again, but good on them for trying something. i've heard more modern telltale adventures have branching plot lines or different endings, so you could play through a few more times to see what happens."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,danganronpa is so convoluted i could definitely play them again. i don't remember much at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,most visual novels. dont most visual novels have multiple endings and different paths that make you have to replay it over and over? or maybe its just those dating sim games lol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"most visual novels? that's a hot take. anecdotal, but every vn i've played has multiple endings with multiple ways to get there."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i have ace attorney on my play list and am excited to check it out
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,then comes disco asylum
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,with ace attorney there's so many cases now across all the games you can easily replay them after a year or two and have forgotten a good chunk of the cases.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"except for case 23, you either forget it right away or it stays with you forever as a scar that goes deep into your brain."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i played snow sakura and there the ending depends on who you date
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"adding the zero escape series. i basically had to wait a decade before i replayed it, and even then, i still knew the plot. i'd just forgotten some of the puzzle solutions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"the infuriating part of the first game was that i knew who the killer was at the end, quite literally 10 hours before i got the chance to accuse them. and then the final? trial did stupid time wasting shit like how do we know you aren't a ghost?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i replay ace attorney once every few years because i have the memory of a goldfish.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"steinsgate is one of the best visual novels and it has multiple repeatability because its amazingduh and when you play once  it seems like an entirely different game and story because you know whats really going on. steinsgate is amazing and the best visual novel i know of. i watched the anime then played the game then bought the elite version of the game and i never once got tired of the story because the more you replay, the more realize nutty shit that is crazy to the plot."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"what? tons of vn's have multiple endings and lots of branching pathsroutes with different characters. they're the one kinda gameentertainment that has the most obvious replayability options. especially romance vn's where you can only pick one character to get close to at a time, you're basically forced to play it multiple times if you want to see everything."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"ive been playing the vn baldr sky, which also has actual gameplay parts, but one playthrough takes about 12 hours. however, there are 13 different endings. ive only done 2 and part of the 3rd and the story changes a fair amount. you can also skip any dialogue that you have read before, but cannot skip unread dialogue"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i've played nekopara multiple times
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i mostly agree, but i've played va11 halla every year in december, one day in game on the actual date. it's still the best written game i've ever played. i love it and everyone in it. even the assholes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i've found danganronpa to be replayable if i wait a year or two. it's mostly just relaxing for me though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,at least theres that kaycees mod update thing to let you play a bunch more of the first part of the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i'm playing it right now and it's my first time to try card games. the exploration and the roguelike mechanic which allows me to try over and over again but with every try something is different and you know better, i love it. i'm still not yet even through with act 1, but i love it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"inscryption is one i'm able to play over and over again, but like you said, it's because of the card game mechanics. i love a good card game. the pokmon tcg game was super fun for me, and act 2 reminds me a lot of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i really liked the card game mechanics and still was done with the game after finishing it. it just worked best as an integral part of the story.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"its rare to say i was playing this card game, and i had about three serious what the fuck moments in the space of ten minutes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"seconded for alan wake. i didn't think the combat was all that repetitive, but then again it's been a while since i've played it. story was so good, cannot wait for the new alan wake. if you haven't, check out control. it's a spiritual successor to alan wake and even has some in game easter eggs connecting them, and it's very good."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,only 1 week until alan wake 2 luckily
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i really loved walking around in the woods even when it was scary. i played the remaster recently and still loved it. it helped that i forgot most of the story but i would play it again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"spec ops the line was another game with repetitive meh gameplay, but a pretty good storyline imo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,this was the game that popped into my mind when i read the title. i think it is still the only game i felt obligated to write a review on steam for. sure the combat was a bit simple and repetitive. but the story and atmosphere was just phenomenal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,alan wake 2 is looking like its way better even
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"bullshit. i replay it once a year or two, merely for the overall atmosphere. love this game. very bummed about what they do with second..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,definitely this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,hmm. i remember enjoying the combat. i'm planning a replay before 2 so i guess i'll see.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i mean, i love it. played it through so many times but can see the repetition. the dlcs and nughtmare are good to tide over for next week!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,recently tried the remaster. i couldn't stomach how dated it felt so i dropped it after about an hour. i'm sure the story is fun but the gameplay is just not good. i'm sure it doesn't help either that i've been playing re4 recently
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,this was witcher 3 for me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,sheeeit i'm replaying it now. been about 10 years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i tried it recently and managed about two episodes before i had to drop it due to the combat being so dull
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,is the remake any good ? i've wanted to play that game again but don't know if i'll enjoy it as much as i did back then.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,square enix's guardians of the galaxy for me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,you played alan wake for the story. i played alan wake to listen to poets of the fall. we are not the same.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i love the ending where you need to press the same buttons over and over for 4 hours and i also love how someone else streamed it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i'm still waiting for the achievement to not play it for 5 years, think i must be close to 3 in at this point, as soon as i get it i'l go and play it for the rest of them"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the familiarity of the combat and the story to every other shooter in the genre was such a good choice. you really do auto pilot until the story starts making your choices clear to you, and then you start to pay more attention to the subtle things.... it's never going to be a masterpiece gameplay wise, but story wise? 100 in my book."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,this is one of the best stories in a game i've played. it was soooooo good and criminally underrated imo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ngl, i've replayed it a few times. still a great game. the second time is actually cool because you pick up on more of the clues as to what is really going on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i loved this game, it was such a surprise for me. it just looked like a generic shooter, until i was told to give it a go by a friend of mine. got in on a steam sale at some point and played through it. have no desire to play it again, but glad i did."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that !white phosphorous! scene ruined me. there's absolutely no way in hell i could bring myself to sit through the whole thing again. phenomenal game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,you feel like a hero yet?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,this was my first thought... that said i'll probably go back to them in a few years. such good games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"same here, theyre like the schindlers list of video games, dont think i can handle all that emotional load again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"just commented this before seeing your comment. so dark and depressing, but fantastic games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"same, maybe 4 plat"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,have you tried outer wilds?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yes. the game is so fun but once you are done you can never play it again. unless you get dementia i guess.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i played it a few times, fun both times, first time i did, i took my time and experienced everything, loved the music 1010 second time i played it i beat it as fast as i could"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"played this with my daughter and we had an absolute blast but yeah, i could never do it a second time, it just wouldnt have the charm. ive heard theres a sequel coming though so that might be worth looking into"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"played it once and all i was missing was one collectible from the beginning. apart from that, i agree its a one time thing. for me at least my kids though, love it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i fucking love stray, i played it over a few days, days when i had nothing to do and all was calm. rain and candlelight just following the story of this cat in the amazing world it took place. i wish i could experience it again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i havent even finished my first play through, just feels like a too large of a task, like im 30h in and still not even half of the map unlocked"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,im actually just now going back in! it's been years so i'm into it again. it's nice to be back in greece.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i'm an aussie but from greek heritage. there's a farm in odyssey that is named the same as our surname. we do not have a common name and i completely lost my mind seeing it in game. wonderful game, but very hard to replay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,lol same i loved that game and i keep telling myself to replay it but i dont think i will
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i was looking at my hours played and it's over 450. such a long and wonderful journey. like my own odyssey.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i have replayed ac2 and brotherhood loads of times replayed ac3 and black flag once or twice will probably replay syndicate and unity at some point will never replay odyssey and origins never finished valhalla the first time
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,id replay it if theyd bring a ps5 patch with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i still occasionally pick this up and just raid outposts or do random quests and bounties. that fire mace is havoc incarnate!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,got my first trophy in june 2019. got my last in october 2022. i loved the game but was so long id keep getting bored
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i was about to comment the same. level 80 now, went into ng years ago and i've only reached athens in the short bursts i spend playing. the thought of doing it all again is an unobtainable dream"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"put in way too many hours, but it was on google stadia so i lost everything when stadia went down. can't bring myself to start over"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,yeah i tried to replay it as kassandra after playing through as alexios the first time and i just gave up so quickly because i just couldnt be bothered getting through it again because the game is just so massive
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i was thinking the same thing about valhalla. even as i was playing it, it got so repetitive and lacking in any challenge that i kept pushing mostly because the setting was awesome and i wanted to see how it ended. will never replay it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it's my favorite game of all time, but i also most likely won't replay it. same with red dead redemption 2, my second favorite game of all time but i probably won't replay it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"very unique answer. all the others mention the understanding of the story and puzzles prevent replayability, but this is highlighting the distaste of the game. hilarious."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i've played 8 assassin's creed games and am currently playing odyssey, but i probably never replay any of them"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i got the platinum on the first playthrough and struggled to enjoy ng despite having lots of build ideas i still want to try.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,after over a year of off and on playing i just beat valhalla main story. it's just so big i have no interest collecting everything. i'm not even sure i want to do the added content stories.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i enjoyed my ng but idk if i could ever do a third run
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"my favorite game in the series, but i agree. starting a new game feels daunting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,any game that takes that long to complete is never getting another play though from me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"loved that game back when it came out, actually just reinstalled it after completing mirage to finally do all the dlc that came out after i had completed at the time it. odyssey gets a lot of flak for the whole ubisoft the game meme but recently with a bunch of shit pc versions of games jedi survivor in particular i recall it playing absolutely perfectly on my laptop while travelling to and from college during breaks so at least it has that going for it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"same. really enjoyed it, but the world is so massive. maybe ill play it in 20 years when i retire and have a lot of time on my hands."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"yeah, i ended up with 84 hours, ill never pick it up again lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i was just about to comment this until i saw your comment, what an amazing game. can't decide if i'm not playing it again for repetitiveness or because i might cry"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ive played through it many times. once i did a no vehicles build using the seaglide, air tubes and deep bases. youre right that the ending is spoiled but its cool to see what alternative play approaches you can take."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i played it like 3 times. it has at least one extra playthrough in it if you find doing hardcore no death run fun. really adds to the fear. never know if this trip in your sub will be your last.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"omg this one. when i first tried subnautica, i was blown away. i sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into it. there was nothing like exploring the caves, and heading back to my base, seeing the base being a light in the pitch black like a beacon of safety was like nothing else. exploring the dead zone for the first time and seeing those monsters come up on you was another amazing first. i tried sub zero. and i might go back. but it just wasent the sameserious no pinging radar? who tf made the choice to get rid of that. and when i go back to the original, i played it so much that i know every location like the back of my hand and it doesn't have the magic of the first playthrough"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"huh, interesting. i could honestly replay subnautica again and again. especially with mods. i experienced real fear in that game when i installed a mod that allows reapers to spawn anywhere.... every time i leave my lifepod i wonder if i'll make it back."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it took me a good couple years before i could seriously play subnautica all the way through a second time. i had to forget as much as possible to make it feel mysterious again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"definitely subnautica for me. took me a few tries to finally get to midgame so to speak, but once i did there was no turning back. it was one of the greatest games i have ever played to completion and even though i think about how incredibly rewarding it was to play, i have no desire to play it again after i have beaten it now still haven't pulled the trigger on getting the second one, heard kind of a mixed bag."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i respectfully disagree with you. i played it the first time almost a year ago and already back then i had in my mind some things that i knew i would want to try on the next try. new ideas for bases, new things i want to see, etc... right now i'm on my second playthrough, what's changed is that i got vr glasses and am playing it through in vr. it is pretty amazing that any fear you feel on the normal version is really amplified by the immersion of the vr, every dark depth and alien sea monster feels like the end of the road, but it's awesome to tackle those."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"journey absolutely has replayability! i think i've played through it a half dozen times by now, and one of the things i love about it is that it's such a beautiful and moving game that you can knock out in an afternoon."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"a work of art, that is. a masterpiece of the early 2010s indie game landscape"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"try out sky children of the light. available on all platforms. its made by the same company, and very similar, but you can actually customize your lil character and make friends and chat and all that. its free."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,ive played journey dozens of times. love it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i beat journey and booted it up to play again immediately lol! the music and visuals were so beautiful that it's definitely worth playing again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i'm kinda hoping i'm going to eventually forget how to finish the game in the same way that i don't remember a lot of the other stuff in the game. maybe it will take a few years but i do expect to play it again eventually.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"nah, it takes about 15 d earlier you cant reach the parts you need and transport them"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,how is this not 1 or 2?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i'm replaying persona 4 on my vita that i leave in the bathroom. vita is a great device for this because you can just sleep the device and pick right up from when you left off.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"new game is a thing to consider. subsequent playthroughs are a mere fraction of the time since you have all your items, money, personal stats, and the ability to buy the persona's you've saved in your codex. i don't think most people know you can save your current persona's stats and build directly into the codex. that way if you ever need to resummon it, you can summon it exactly as it was with the abilities and moves."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ive beaten the game twice once on the original p5 and once on royal and i dont think i can go back to it for like a decade. and this is like one of my absolute favorite games i love this game, but some of the issues the combat system being a little too easy and the story really just being pretty good for what it is really stick out to me more than ever. but like i said, this is like tied with mother 3 for my favorite game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"this one. i have actually played the game like 50h and was halfway through and then went to vacation. forgot about it after and then i thought about starting from scratch... yeah, didn't happen, just couldnt go through all these chats again even if the story was interesting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,maybe in a few years. i recently replayed p4 for the first time since it first came out. it was much more meaningful and left me with bitter sweetness after i completed it as a 30 year old vs when i was a teenager. maybe it's just me remembering and projecting my own high school days
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i replayed it when royal came out, my playtime on that file came out around 130 hours. i don't know if i'll do it again. it's crazy how many options that game gives you but given that i've spent probably 250 hours on it already i don't think i'd ever in my life get through all of them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ive completed p5 once and p5r twice. it has great replayability for me because of all the different personas and challenges you can try. joker only, physical attacks only, only using personas from 1 arcana etc yeah the game is really long, but the story is still incredible even after you know what happens"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"pretty much the only way to see every confidant's story is by playing the game twice or more. on ng, your social stats and a lot of other stuff carry over, making it a lot easier to play through every confidant"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"yeah i played royal after beating the original release a few months prior but i could only get halfway through royal before i simply got burnt out. hoping to take another swing at royal in the future though, such a great game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i beat it twice. base game and then royal. i love persona though so it's pretty easy for me to justify playing a new version. played p4 3 times, once on ps2, once in vita, once on pc. gonna do my third p3 playthrough with the remake in february"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the ng content is worth it, plus you can't really max out all stats in the first playthrough. and because of royal, i basically played the game 4 times total, and it was glorious. the storyline for royal is inferior to the base game, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i played p5r for like 100 hours. had a great time. then got to the dr maruki fight, spent 3 hours in combat with him going through hundreds of consumables, just to have the main character randomly get oneshot. could not go through that again, so i quit the game. still have no idea how it ends lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,same for 3 and 4.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"this is what i was thinking. i honestly didn't love the game because of the high school simulator narrative, and the fact that everything was time gated, but it was still an enjoyable experience overall and the combat is top notch. but i would rather play just about anything than replay p5. the game is just not really set up for it imo, even though it should be with all the different things you can do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i would definitely replay it a few years later after beating it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"agreed, p5 royal is one of the best games i have personally played and it was such a great experience, but the incredibly long playtime is daunting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,im in the exact same boat as you. playing persona 5 completely changed my life and it easily sits as my favorite game of all time and i still obess over it a year later. everything about the game is so perfect but i cannot for the life of me muster up the will to finish the last third semester added in royal even though i played through the rest of the game up until that point. its kinda annoying because im not participating in any fandom discourse until ive done it to avoid spoilers but who knows how long it will be until that fated day that i finish the final bit of the game is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,ive played the first 3 times and im on my first play of p5r. i just really like the game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ive actually replayed this game 3 times one initial playthrough on vanilla and 2 playthroughs on royal. i think its worth replaying if you didnt get all of the confidants or complete the compendium on the first playthrough, and in my case, there are story elements that i picked up on that i missed in the first playthrough."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"when i first played through it all the way through, i absolutely played through it a few more times and then i did a run through of persona 5 royal. i feel like all the confidants, story beats, music and gameplay are burnt into my brain, so i probably won't play through it again for a few years. i played it a bunch during covid when i had all the time in the world, which is also why i played through royal directly after playing through the original"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's 100 hours?! i'm playing p4g at the moment and hope to do 5 after.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i played vanilla, royal, and then a ng on royal. i was thinking about going back for ng after beating p5 strikers. game is just a lot of fun and super stylish. it just hits right, ya know?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i replayed this game twice the original as a ng and p5r when i was feeling down. i loved the game so much that the replays felt like interacting with a comfort object, if that makes sense. the music and general vibe just feel good to me. i ffd through dialog for the most part except the new royal content and could turn my brain off to let the dopamine flow."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,when we replay p5 we usually do like challenge runs and stuff to spice up the new play through i myself also just skip the dialogue to make it quicker
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"my wife has about 1000 hours across all her files in persona 5. its an amazing game and i respect the shit out of her, but i could never beat a game like that over and over and over again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i love p5 and now i'm replaying it in royal, aiming to get the goodies in ng. but the fact that the prologue is extremely dragged out for someone who has known the story makes it really daunting to replay it just to actually start the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"100 agree loved everything about the game, but can't see myself playing again"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"after 350 hours, all achievements, and 8 playthroughs, i am finally ready to wait for the dlc before i pick it up again lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i feel like it loses a lot of its charm after the first playthrough, because you lose the mystery of i wonder what i will find over there i did a ng for the platinum just rushing everything but i don't think i'll ever play it alone again with friends in seamless coop is another story"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it's understandable. after i beat the game and started a new one with another character, i just started thinking about how long it took originally to get to the end. like, yeah i can speed run, and i'm better prepared. but with how static the game world is though still fun  for sure, i just didn't think a second run was needed. i also don't know if i wanted to be bothered again with act 3."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,honestly the sense of exploration and wonder does go away after the first playthrough. but trying new builds and doing pvp is still fun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the real replayability is forcing someone who has never played one to play through it, and trying not to rage and take the controller from them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i've played through portal 2 multiple times though and its still always a blast for me thanks to the great atmosphere and writing
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,this guy does not speedrun
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"my friend played the crap out of portal, he loved seeing how fast he could clear the levels. im pretty sure he held a few speed records at some point."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"once you beat it, you try again and see if you can do it faster"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i've played both portal games many times, it's the atmosphere and glados that captivates me"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,perpetual testing initiative
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"disagree. portal is so charming and engaging that you can play it many times and it's great every time. can add replayability by trying to beat levels faster, with fewer steps, with fewer portals, without dying, without ever entering the blue portal, etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"half life and portal games, due to the nature of their sandbox, how they feel, interact, etc. feel very replayable, even given that they are linear. it's hard to describe. they're just fun, even on repeat."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i disagree, i've beaten portal twice in like 10 years, i don't remember the levels at all."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the trick to making it repayable is to go loooong periods of time between playthroughs. portal 2 objectively had more replayability because the puzzles are harder and has a better story
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i've replayed both portal games like a dozen times each. but to be fair, i replay the 1st mostly as a prologue so i can enjoy the story and gameplay of the 2nd. nothing will beat that first playthrough, but i just find it fun."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i keep replaying portal every 34 years. i usually forget the puzzle solutions by then, or at least only have a sense of direction on what i should be doing. it's a fun and quick game like that and it's great for nostalgia."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"the thing i liked about portal 1 over 2 was that each room had multiple solutions, one of the downgrades in portal 2 was that there really was only one solution to each room because of how they designed it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"not to mention the surprises in the story and how the levels evolve, especially in portal 2."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"or just wait years between playthroughs so you forget most of the solutions. its been about 5 years since my last run, im about ready again. and my current gaming system is significantly more powerful than my last one"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i forgot about this game and might replay it. i haven't played it in maybe a decade, and my memory is so shit i'm sure to have forgotten the puzzles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yeah but after few years is good to replay both i just did it and i was surprised again on how fresh and unique its portal
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's been so long that i'm sure i'd need time to figure things out and laugh at the same jokes
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i recently replayed portal2 spent more time focusing on the jokes and humor the 2nd time, so i do recommend it. one or two of the puzzles possed a challenge, mostly cause i didn't realize i could put a portal there, but ya not as much of a challenge as the first play thru."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the trick is forgetting
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,im excited to jump back into these games. i think its been long enough that ive forgotten all the puzzles
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i mean if you wait long enough you're gonna forget the solutions.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"ironically, just finished a replay of portal yesterday. just wanted the atmosphere, had no problem with any of the puzzles  but did discover the radio achievement so frustrated myself getting about half of them blind, and now im debating another playthrough to get the rest."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i can see why this would cause a lot of people to not want to replay portal. i personally love replaying them, because i forget how to solve most of the puzzles pretty much immediately after beating them, because my short term memory is garbage."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i kind of agree. maybe with one but 2 def seems a bit more replayable. but i know what you're saying. i'm sure a few playthrus you'd notice things ordinarily missed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,community chambers. especially the noneucledians.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i think that depends on how good your memory is. i'm about ready for another playthrough, pretty sure i've forgotten most of the solutions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i just wait 5 years or so between playthroughs. done both games a few times
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,portal has an excellent storyline and is probably the most replayable puzzle game ever along with its sequel.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"community maps are practically infinite, and all much harder than the main game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,the trick to replaying portal is taking a very long break between replays so you forget every solution to the puzzles
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i was really surprised how good inside was. it's short but a really enjoyable experience. you should check out cacoon if you haven't already. it's about the same length of game and quite unique.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i played braid at least twice and just the other day was considering another go.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,braid doesn't get enough love
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,little nightmares are my favourite you can definitely replay them every halloween
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i'm currently replaying little nightmares 2 and it still does well at ratcheting up the tension, so definitely some varying mileage on this one. planning to skip the mannequin bit though. my hands are too stiff and full of raynaud's to manage that again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i've replayed inside a few times just because i love the atmosphere so much. especially when you first head into the city
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"sad because i originally planned a slytherin and gryffindor playthrough, but theres essential no different besides robe colors. the common rooms are cool too but no reason to go there. also weird how everyone just disappears at night. too bad they likely cut the curfew system"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,they nail the magic and mystery but hard flopped on the acvalhallaesque activity bloat.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"yeah it was fun and i dont regret buying it or playing it, but i never want to again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i can understand this, but i also loved the game. i could maybe see myself playing it again in a new house a couple years or so down the line when its fallwinter, im in the hp mood and ive forgotten most of it lol. or whenever that new hbo show comes out. who knows."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"agreed, until you can play it in vr, then definitely worthwhile for another go"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,hellblade was my first thought. whole game builds up the end  plot twist and i dont think it can be archived again. rushed through half of the game on a second run as i missed one trophy but have it up after some time. most of the fun comes from revealing the plot
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i'm about to play hellblade after i saw the trailer for the second part.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i love dott. i replay it every few years. it brings me so much joy, reminding me of my days as child without a worry in the world. so much of the humor was wasted on me when i was young that i didn't get until playing it as an adult."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,crazy to see this so far down on the list! the game is amazing and the atmosphere of walking around to find new puzzles and discovering how all of them work and tie together is incredible. plus discovering the greater puzzles in the world itself is a feeling i can never experience again for the first time but envy those who can.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i agree. my pick was telltale the wolf among us.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"this is how i feel about god of war ragnarok im a single dad with full custody of a 9 year old boy, its just been me and him for years. the game came with my ps5 so i tried it and fuck man nobody told me it was going crush my soul like that. beat it, deleted it, will never touch it again"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i actually rebought this for pc once i got an amazing graphics card. i've tried like 5 times to start the game again, but it's just too slow for a replay. still my favorite game ever though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i've managed two playthroughs, one when it first came out, and then another a year later so i could take it reaaaaalllly slow while completing it 100. it was nice being able to pace myself knowing what comes around the corner."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i tried a couple of times and just cant get through it a second time
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,can you not replay it due to the emotion? i think the world has huge replayability but getting thru the story and really accruing moneyweaponry to fully enjoy that world takes sooo long. i was never able to bring myself to create a second game for this reason
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i did a low honor playthrough then i did a high honor one. then on my 3rd playthrough i got to the part i couldn't continue the story and restarted it again .
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yeah definitely didn't want to cry again at the end.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"did you play heavy rain or detroit become human? same studio, same great story telling, but even more choices and therefore replayability"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"there are a few things i would like to try differently about quantic dream's big three, but i can't endure the thought of going through qtes and shitty movement mechanics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i think the dead space series and resident evil 4 remake are the only horror games i've replayed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i could play resident evil 2 remake, re7, and re8 a hundred times and never get bored. something about the formula of those games just scratches an itch in me that nothing else can."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,alien isolation is replayable bc the xeno stalks you instead of scripted scares
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"im surprised i had to scroll as far as i did to see this. i agree, horror games only punch once. after that any replaying is just because."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i love to replay infinite because is so scenographic and detailed, even if i know its flawed and overall ruined the saga story, its so eyecandy and the shooting is pretty good. in my opinion, the most replayable of the bioshocks"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,man the number of times i felt my heart sink in that game was just too much. im planning on playing it again but maybe in another couple years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i felt like the gameplay was so good i had to replay it on a higher difficulty, which made for a totally difference experience. but i skipped a lot of cutscenes, youre right too intense"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i was depressed after because of the emotional flood. will play again sometime but its been 2 years
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i had to take a big long break after the first time because, yeah, i can only willfully put myself into a depression so often. but like childbirth, you give yourself enough time to forget how much it hurt and then trick yourself into thinking it won't be so bad this time because you know what to expect. i've done 3 runs and will probably do another in a year or 2. love those games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"its one of my favourite all time games for the one time i played it. its like the boy in striped pajamas. ive experienced it, my brain was ridiculously stimulated and my heart can take no more"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,im actually doing a replay right now and im really enjoying it. its been a few years since i last beat so ive forgotten a lot of details about the plot. plus the gameplay is just chefs kiss
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the game is great, i love it. visuals are great, animations are great, music is superb and of course story is amazing. it hit hard and i loved every minute of this game, but once you finish it and know all the story hooks, twists and feels its not the same. i wanted to replay it recently just for fighting and music but gave up at the main menu because i didn't want to spoil all the great memories by degrading it to mindless hack and slash"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"my first time i ignored most side quests and struggled hard on some of the later areas. when i replay it, i'll take my time and see what i missed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i'll agree with you on this, i loved the game, particularly once you hit the second map and start building roads it's just a joy every time you get another section completed and can zoom around the map like it's nothing, completely gold star deliveries like a pro. i feel no compulsion to go back and rebuild my expansive zipline network over the mountain. i am however looking forward to doing it again on a new map with a new situation in the sequel."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,jesus i forgot all about that one. i got it on release and was absolutely glued but yeah the closer you get to an ending the more you realize they're deus ex'ing you fucking constantly. i was furious.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the first run was really fun, because it seemed like every decision was so important. on the second run, you figure out that the story runs almost entirely on the same rails from start to finish. i mean, i still collected all the different endings, but most of the game is identical from one playthrough to another."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,3 hours later and i think this is the most common answer ive seen scrolling through
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"with master mode, the sword trials, and the hero's path i found myself enjoying ng more than my first run through. with exploration and all, i finished the first run in 150 hours. lots of koroks and exploring. but master mode took me maybe 5060 hours with all the dlc and i had more fun playing around with the environments i recognized more than discovering new areas. unlocked the full map and beat all divine beasts in both runs."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i guess i see where youre coming from, but especially until dawn and the quarry have replayability as there are so many choices that drastically alter the game that i played through multiple times just to see the different outcomes. also collectibles that are easy to miss on the first plays."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ff7r i instantly went back through on ng , ffxvi, stopped around 13 because i was skipping through so much dialogue. will go back at some point though because some parts are so good. to be honest it's pretty rare i'd ng a game these days , especially something over 20 hours long."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i just can't redo those long ass playable cutscenes with qtes. only thing i was over after 5 minutes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ask me in a couple years, i'll probably replay it then."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i honestly loved it for the first couple hours and then it got way too samey
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i made it through the story and while i'd like to finish it, completing the pokedex is too boring. love the gameplay of it though and really want another legends game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"my wife and i just finished forever. it was incredible, but sucks there is no random elements at all to replay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"still have to start it up again after 5 years, just for the achievement"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,you experience everything in the game if you do everything in the game? i would hope so.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"romhacks, nuzlockes, or monotype challenges are a great way to replay pokmon one of my favorite pokmon experiences was playing a crystal hack over covid using only ground type. pretty tough run"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's for church sweatie.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"why is it no good on replay? i've been thinking of buying it digital on switch. endless ocean was my favorite game on the wii, i loved the swimming simulation and that you couldn't die so it was all about exploring"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"oh shit, what i wouldnt give to experience that game again from zero"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i really like the levels tho, i played it twice once on my ps4 and again when i got a pc and i plan on doing it a third time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i replaying some of the missions because it actually fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"hard disagree, i played it several times, cause there is so much ways to play. even went to speedrunning it for a while."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"its like it takes two each level has a great mechanic, then wantonly leaves it in the next level for another great mechanic"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i feel the same as you. im not really into mech games, so when i played tf2 i was constantly surprised by how fun and clever it is. dont have any desire to do it again thoughi dont feel like i missed anything."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,you can certainly replay levels and try out different loadouts against bosses
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,now that you mention it rdr2. i took my time and had a blast the first playthrough. second time around i got over halfway through in very little time then just stopped
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i replayed elden ring coop. it was super fun, we skipped a lot of side quests and dungeons though actually surprisingly quick"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,there's always more builds. unless you've beat every boss with every archetype you definitely haven't gotten the full available experience.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ahh yeah, once i beat it i realized you can find the ending of the game within a few minutes if starting it. it was fun the first time though, and a little sad."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,maybe thats why i couldnt get into forbidden west. it felt too familiar and killing those robots didnt really do it for me anymore. absolutely loved the first one though
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,those are two weird exceptions.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i would edit this so there are no spoilers.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i completely disagree. you see the game in an entirely new context and catch onto a lot of the foreshadowing that was right in your face. the relationship between atlas and jack is compelling knowing just how much hes actually messing with you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,shut your damn mouth! portal 1 is so short my brother and i used to both start a game at the same time and race to the finish. we got it down to like 40 minutes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,is that you todd?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i mean, it's hard to say there's no replayability when the real ending of the game can only be achieved on ng, both new ng cycles adding more stuff to the first one."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,uhhh what... the game has many different choices and ways you can do quests... do you not understand the topic or something?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i can see not wanting to based off of plot reveals but i played kotor several years ago and the idea of going back doesnt seem that daunting to me considering the different ways you could play. though its certainly not a game i would have any interest replaying without considerable time between playthroughs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,brb let me do today's wordle a few more times
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"to put it simply, the game is highly enjoyable for many, making it easy to replay. the story, traversal, combat, graphics, and music all contribute to its replayability. it's okay if you don't feel the same, but those are the reasons."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,you might have picked one of the most replayable games of all time lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"while i get your point. i think its hard to get people to trust theyll enjoy any game with zero information. my introduction to the game was reading about its primary game mechanic. thats what made me excited to play it, and i dont think that it hurt my enjoyment. you find out pretty quickly anyway. that being said, im glad thats all that i knew."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i bought that game based on the cover art and not much more, and thats one of the best gaming decisions ive ever made. cool game, wish i could experience that again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"don't think there are any spoilers here, and i'd like to keep it that way! but... i'm literally 610 hours in and it just feels like a confusing mess of faceless names talking on those blue squiggles. combined with dyingrestarting alot. i've absolutely given up on enjoying it, and i know that sounds defeatist, but maybe i'm doing everything wrong, or it's just not for me. i've been warned before not to look things up, but them i'm left not having anything to do but fly somewhere, not understand what i'm looking at, then wiping. advice?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i thought the game looked great and was excited to play it. made it maybe 2030 minutes into the game before i was annoyed with the controls mostly the jumping and refunded the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"its been years, but i could still do !the final voyage! if you asked me to. suffering from success."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"made it right up to the last bit but couldn't figure out what to do because i'd been playing it in little jumps and starts and couldn't remember two specific things. the notes are there, it should have all been spelled out, but i just missed the connection. looked it up, thought oh, dang then never actually finished."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,havent heard of that one before  thx!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"even if you know the puzzle solutions in portal, you can still go through it and have fun with the gameplay. outer wilds is litteraly over in less than ten minutes if you've already beaten it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"sure, you can replay any game and still have some fun. but a game that is all about discovery is going to lose a lot more replayability than most other games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i believe you're thinking of outer worlds. op is talking about outer wilds. definitely check it out, it's amazing!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,there's no character builds or combat in outer wilds. you're probably thinking of outer worlds!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the way they use curiousity as the main gameplay system and way of storytelling is very unique and they did it very well. diminishing it to a walking simulator is also weird.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"people complain about the puzzles and platforming being too hard and punishing lmao, in no way is it a walking simulator."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,if you havent experienced the ending you really cant say anything
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,about oliver's is great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"pointcrow's playthrough on steam so with funny chat is very fun. streamer so entertaining, plays it seriously, talks about his theories constantly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"to be clear, we are talking about outer wilds, with an i. do not confuse it with outer worlds, which is a fine game but not the masterpiece outer wilds is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"different game. that's outer worlds, this is outer wilds, with an i."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"wish i was you then, i've finished in 2019 and still remember most of it. i'm still surprised there is no other company that tried something similar in the style."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,a lot of us did! particularly for those four or so chinese dudes..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,my steam playtime is listed at 4 hours. i remember sitting down shortly after work and working my way through the game. i was also texting my friends throughout the play session.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"im curious, ill never play this game, whats the secret ending? spoiler"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"after the weekend where you choose one of the girls to work with shit hits the fan, took me like 1.52 hours to reach that point"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,lmao how can you even determine that a game will take 6 years to make
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"they were bought by valve, development on in the valley of gods has been on hold since 2019. they all worked on half life alyx though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i felt that way too until i thought about it for a few days. there was no better way to end it. it was like the ending of the sopranos or no country for old men. i hated it, but i kinda liked that they made me hate it, if that makes sense."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i think its supposed to suck. its about running from your problems, sooner or later youll have to face reality which isnt as exciting. atleast thats what i took from it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,agreed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"well, yeah? playing a narrative driven singleplayer game won't feel the same if you already watched it lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i guess i have watched a couple of let's plays on youtube after i finished the games so the story is still mostly fresh in my head. plus it's fun to see other people figuring it out for their first time
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i revisit the series every other year or so, i always remember who does it but i either forget how or i forget how to prove it. will always be one of my favorite series"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i normally never replay games anyway so i don't think every game has to be replayable
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,just you wait
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,plus acts 2 and 3 are a slight let down given that act 1 is completely masterful.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"is in same universe, alan wake shows up even"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,dont forget about the dlc that has a direct connection to wake.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i'm playing through that remaster and i played it when it came out. overall the encounters are usually so quick and you have so many tools and it's slightly more challenging than i remembered i think it's fine. honestly i think the game's biggest fault is when you're mired in the mid game it has a very bad habit of taking you to a place and then nothing happening and very quickly going to the next place and i think that's what does the combat a disservice. rather than get lots of nice story points punctuated by a good combat instead you get a lot of kind of nothing at those breaks. so you're going right back to the combat so fast i don't think that is inherently it's fault just some poor story pacing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,to me it was just fight the same generic human over and over with the same technique.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"its not a remake, its just alan wake uprezzed a bit to todays standards. it probably looks how our brains remember it originally looking but if we dug out a 480p tv from the dump wed realise its much better"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i bought the ultra deluxe edition when it came out and didnt play it right away. now im a year into the dont play for ten years achievement and well, im not sure if i should play it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"agreed, gameplaywise it's basically like every other thirdperson military shooter from the ps3x360 era, but i guess that's kind of the point. it's supposed to feel familiar and comfortable for the player right up until it isn't."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,im so glad it was never spoiled that it was essentially ! another retelling of heart of darknessapocalypse now ! going in with no knowledge of where that story was going is essential i think
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"it was on sale and i read it only takes a long afternoon to beat. i went in thinking it will be just a generic, but enjoyable campaign to spend a lazy sunday. lol lmao"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i disagree on your masterpiece gameplay point. sure, it's basic standard shooting, but it had to be. its a masterpiece of gameplay masquerading as a mediocre one. because if the gameplay was anything other than exactly what might be expected, it wouldn't work as well. that, in itself, is a masterpiece. masterpieces don't have to be amazing or unique, they have to be perfect. and it is perfect, for the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it actually makes it kinda rough to play other military shooters, at least for a while. it does such a good job of playing with that just following orders line of thinking where you just hit objective after objective to progress the story without really thinking about what your actions mean"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,not only great games but many aaa developers could use it as a lesson on how to make good female protagonists without making things weirdly political.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ah ffs, and i just recently got them on sale."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i remember buying it and playing it when i had covid just exactly 3 years ago and now i don't remember anything if you would ask me. i guess it's like movies though that once you start memories start coming back.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,so annoyed it got taken off ps plus when it did. i was planning on playing through it soon and then it left before i noticed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"saaame. also its one of those games that when played on hard mode, the enemies dont become more skilled, they just take forever to kill."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"even without dlcs you'd reach well over 100 hours to finish, and that's practically speed running. can't remember how many hours i spent on odyssey but i really wish i could get it all back... edit in a good way though i wish i had the patience to replay it. if you have the time and interest, it's worth it. especially the dlc"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"the ac series sometimes is the only game series that tries to be faithful to the people who actually lived in those places. for ex they dont just make the character in the game random british dudes with fair skin, bc they likely would be olive skinned with some middle eastern features. unlike hollywood where ancient greeks are always british"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"thers a good 30 hours of content in the dlc if you havent played that yet. i had to bail halfway through ch1 od dlc 2. as someone who hates chip damage, loot mountains, and dialogue options, i had finally reached a point all that stuff, on top of some other gameplay issues i had, had worn me down into no longer enjoying the game. but if you loved all that stuff, the dlc is just a tone more of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"its not a distaste of the game. its just how big the game is. the locations and stuff are awesome, the story line is pretty good. its just takes so long to finish. 194 hours i spent to 100."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's a gorgeous one isn't it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i tend to like to replay narrativeheavy games like edith finch. when i go back and revisit it, i pick up on all the little bits of foreshadowing and symbolism that i may have missed because i didn't know the ending, and edith finch is packed with this from the very first instant. the symbols, the narrative, the subtext. how the house itself tells the story, and how edie is literally the one telling the story, how both work together to shape a story. it's such a powerhouse of phenomenal writing, and it's inextricably tied to gaming. yeah, for me it's the crying. this one, endling extinction is forever, and that dragon, cancer are all in a box labelled awesome game, never again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,.that is a lot of air tubes
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i mean...the ending is not really mind blowing. what i think could be spoiled are the areas you can explore and how it just keeps....going. i tried to get into the sequel but it just didn't seem nearly as good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,subzero is like subnautica by disney
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i don't understand why noone else has made anything like it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"what would be better, the first or 2nd to play?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,just finished the second one. it has no soul. you're not alone and afraid. half the game is on land. boring. and the ipad is the most obnoxious indian woman accent. and it talks alllllll the time
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"white robe full gold trim master here. play journey at least like twice a year since it came out, along with the other thatgamecompany games flow and flower."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,yeah man. im team replay. its nice to be the helper instead of the follower when you meet someone. such a perfect game. this is also my favorite game to watch other people play. i used to make all my friends play it and i enjoyed watching the wonder of their discovery.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i agree with this statement
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"outer wilds is harder than most games though. i'll replay super metroid every 5 years or so and manage to forget most of that game, but the solution to outer wilds' final puzzle is so memorable i'm not sure i'll ever be able to forget it enough for it to stump be again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i'm not gonna say that it should be a top voted response but i was surprised that i didn't see any top level reply mentioning tunic. i definitely would have expected it to be mentioned somewhere amongst the many outer wildsobra din comments.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"cool idea, just maybe give that vita a lil clean every now and then haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,have you tried changing the difficulty or fusing other personas?? that fight should not be taking 3 hours let alone just the first phase
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,only 350 hours? rookie numbers
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"my first playthrough was 101 hours, did your beat ng playthroughs in 30 hours or something?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"completely agree. it was a really magical experience, but i dont really have any desire to play it a second time. honestly, its almost too daunting to even consider. the game just has so much to do. am very much looking forward to the dlc, though. im assuming spring 2024 release date."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that's where the souls series shines. the problem in regards to replayability with elden ring is it takes so fucking long to traverse the map. i tried going to ng7 when the game first came out but back then you had to recollect everything every time you completed a playthrough. all the shop bells and everything. it was a slog. it's a little easier now but still a bit much for me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the challenge is real also happy cake day
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"portal 2 is a little different, it has more replayability. there's more of a story with some puzzles in between. game play and puzzles feel more fluid, where playing through all 20 tutorial chambers in portal 1 felt like a straight puzzle game until you get past it. but that's part of the experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"oh, good. my slowclap processor made it into this thing. so we have that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ah, insidethe good ol meat sack."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i watched inside walkthrough on youtube and just couldn't stop. then i played a game and couldn't stop. then i showed walkthrough to a friend and we couldn't stop and watched all 4 hours in one evening. inside is just a gem edit when anybody asks me for a perfect game, i just say inside. it's a genre masterpiece in and out"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"cocoon and inside were made by the same guy btw. and its such a masterpiece, i havent been so blown away by a puzzle game since portal"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i completed cocoon yesterday and i agree it's a great game! definitely a unique experience!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,spoiler alert.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"exactly, i loved the game and chose raven claw but i probably wont replay it for a few years and apparently they are making a second game so if we are new students again then thats when i would change."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"what, you don't like finding hogwarts themed gloves and hats exploring ancient tombs and caves? or killing the same 3 enemy types everywhere you travel? their blood is on ranrok's hands!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i tried. really enjoyed my first playthrough and because the combat is fun, i sorta wanted to give it another go with a different house. but i just couldn't. i made it about a third of the way through my second time and had to stop, because as interesting as the combat is, it wasn't a good enough reason to push through to the end."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,exactly. loved my time with it and moved on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i feel a similar way about it. the films are usually played every year around christmas time and they'll probably get me in the mood for it and i'll do a new playthrough then.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i mentioned that one, too. just played it a couple of weeks ago. i thought it was just a fantastic game, but no reason to ever replay it again. it's interesting that games that are more narrative are less replayable, but i will read a book i love multiple times. not sure what the difference is in a deep way  obviously the function is different, but why is it such a different brain experience?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,it's a game that you will remember.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,we must be better. for their sake.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"ah, a gentleman of culture."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the first time i played it i was rushing it to get to the end, the thing is, it takes at least 60 hours to get to that ending, i enjoyed very little of the game. now i've entered a new mind state, one to take it slow, to enjoy the scenery, to absorb the world and the stuff that happens on it but i did skip the 1st chapter because fuck that and im enjoying it way more than the first time"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i tried at least a couple of times just trying to reach the point where you are somewhat estabilished in the world so i could freely explore, but never got to the point again. at least john marston was saved at least three times so far."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"for me, it really comes down to using the left side of the controller again at the end. i don't think i have ever felt such a strong emotional reaction to such a simple choice of game mechanics before."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"actually, resident evil 4 was the transition between horror and action horror, because once you go past the village, it's all about surviving and killing them plagas, nothing to be scared of, maaaaybe the scene with the bug below the castle and the iron maiden presentation, but that's it. same with dead space, once you have progressed enough and you learn that they hate dismemberment as much as a normal person would, you can easily press ahead feeling like a badass, then there's the occasional jumpscare, but besides the usual horror intro, the rest is being proud of learning the enemies' weaknesses."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"yeah, survival horror works well because a lot of the scare factor is the scarce resources as opposed to simply jump scares and the unknown."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i don't think it holds a candle to replaying bioshock 2 with new builds to be honest. bs2 has so many broken weapons just begging to be used for a run.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yeah the carbine with headphones on just feels properly heavy somehow. like a cannon
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"likewise, grounded difficulty was quite the experience and i loved it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i played through my first time on regular difficulty and it definitely felt the whole time like it was meant to be a little harder. i hate bullet sponge shooters though, so i think regular enemy health with hard resource availability is the way to go."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the jewelers shop is actually you dont remember hitting and killing that old man as this character? huh, weird  like its gaslighting the video game lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it really does make all the choices feel dramatic! the ability to choose to fail things that have tangible impacts like the finger is good, but you realize theres 3 other ways to get the info you need so only one person really matters"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,agreed. i was replaying the quarry this year for achievements and i discovered so many small things and scenes id never seen or even heard of before.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"it understandably cant recreate the horror, and once you know the story its not worth replaying. with that being said, it is definitely worth it to keep playing not replaying to build and improve on your bases."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the time travel level slaps.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,a good argument but soul stream go kamehameha
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i get that, and its an awesome point. i guess i got enough out of it personally to look back and make some of those connections, but i also did try and replay it fairly soon after originally finishing it so it may have just been too fresh. i really appreciate your thoughts, so i may have to go back and try again now thats its been a few years!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i see what youre saying but thats kinda what i mean, after ng its kind of a definitive end"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i dont understand the topic, please elaborate."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,but you can play wordle every single day. it's a puzzle game with near infinite possibilities. so it's more replable than other games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it cracks me up when a stranger on the internet is like the less you know the better, go play it without even mentioning like. the genre. is it a racing game? an fps? you dont have to spoil anything to say its a selfdirected explorationenvironmental puzzle game with a concrete but at first unclear goal. people know if theyre the kind of person who like that kind of game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"imo the right amount of info to give people is to explain that its like myst but in a whole solar system. im all for hiding the mechanics and reveals, but if people arent properly calibrated for a narrative based mystery story, where you do need to read everything and its not just meaningless flavor text, things wont go so well at first."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"if you're talking about what i think you are then i've something to add. i went in blind like everyone recommended and that main mechanic frustrated me so much i almost quit. i couldn't figure out what i was doing wrong. then i looked it up, realized it's a feature and not a mistake on my part, and from there i finished and enjoyed the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's definitely fair to point out that the majority of the game is flying through space and they there are janky jumping mechanics which a settings toggle fixes for most people. and that there is no combat. whether or not to mention the time mechanic is a different story. i think the were definitely some people who didn't know about that and ended up not liking the gameplay loop because of it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"what, you can even do !the coordinates! from memory?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"you should finish it. i also played it over a few months so by the end i didn't remember every hint, but i still had so many ohhh damn! moments. there's so much to discover and i loved the ending of the base game, it's well worth finishing. then there is echoes of the eye which will shock you all over again. even the very start was an oh shit moment."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i'd highly reccomend playing it, it's up there with outer wilds and obra dinn for me. the puzzles get really hard though lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"you're absolutely right, i did misread it... again outer wilds does seem interesting and i am curious on how it can be completed so easily, since it looks like it's supposed to be a puzzle game and normally puzzle games are actually essentially a puzzle within a puzzle"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yes this. thank you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,ill look into it thanks!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i second this, super smart playthrough where he's excellent at verbalising his thoughts and theories. there's a supercut version of his outer wilds playthrough which i recommend and found out about him through but also got me watching his hollow knight playthrough which is also excellent!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's actually already been in development for 5 yearshttpswww.rockpapershotgun.comcamposantosinthevalleyofgodshasaprobablymeaningless2029releasedate. the reality is campo santo got bought by valve and this game is never coming out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it's better than saying it will be out next year, then delaying for 5 years, or releasing a half finished, broken game, or both. sure, they could just say tbd, but if 2029 is their goal, then it's not so bad, imo"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i get that, but in my opinion the 'juice wasn't worth the squeeze' sopranos, no country for old men, they all had a lot going on throughout, peaks and troughs. firewatch felt the entire time like it was building up to something, this sense of mystery, like what is going on... oh absolutely nothing. i also found the romance elements between you and the other firewatch lady to be extremely trite and the fact that too fizzled out from nothing into somehow even more nothing left me thinking i'd just wasted 10 hours of my time. game looked really good though i'll give them that. loved the style"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i was a little disappointed but i was thinking about it for days, then thought, if a games ending still has me thinking about things after a week, maybe it's a pretty damn good ending"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"for ace attorney, just wait until they rerelease it again in 510 years and hopefully by then you forgot"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i think the game got a little canon heavy in acts 2 and esp 3. if youve played other dan mullins games they hit the nail on the head but otherwise it probably felt kinda random and overdone.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yeah i stopped after act 1.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that's kinda awesome. it would be cool to see more different games within that expanded universe.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i mustve absolutely missed this. loved control. tried quantum break and couldnt get into it. might try alan wake before the second comes out
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,...i'd more suggest thomas zane does.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,bro i had no fuckin idea the direction that story took. absolutely crazy twist and turn. one of a kind experience imo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"oh my god. you blew my mind with the fact that it's supposed to feel like every shooter back then, mocking or parodying the style. right until the end do you realize this same game questions your decisionmaking making you feel dirty and disgusting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i require elaboration. what aaa female protagonist in recent years was made to be weirdly political?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,below zero felt way too crammed. subnautica was so cool since anything could just attack you out of the darkness. in below zero you spend half of the time 10 meters under the sea or crammed into a cave.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,its not as good. i think i stilled played through it three times though. there just something about the setting i enjoy. as survival games go its my favorite. i also appreciate the humor in the writing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"definitely the first. better story, better map i think."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"also, so many of the caves are cut and pasted or just mirror images. gets very repetitive after a while"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"it was a different game. similar to farcry 5, you start realizing that the villains do make a lot of sense. in spec ops, you expect a normal shooting game, then you discover that you are actually killing civilians and us soldiers."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i got the outer world's and outer wilds confused and was wondering why my buddy was taking so long to finish it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"is it like the forest? i hated it.. but i want to play outer wilds since people love it so much. i couldnt see the point of figuring out how to play the forest, like there must be 1000 to 1 wrong to right ways to move forward, so thats not going to be fun.."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"thanks, your description actually helps a ton. because i was thinking the same thing, why should i trust some random persons vague description?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"this. i'm sure the game is good, but people jerk it off to high heavens and everyone is always incredibly smug with a you have to buy it but you are not allowed to know anything about it hehe wink wink as if mentioning the genre or main selling point was a spoiler punishable by death. i'm honestly so tired of always hearing about it i've decided i never want to play it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i mean, it's a double edged sword. even knowing the genre is major spoilers and lowers the experience, and the whole game is about the experience. that said you're not wrong that just telling people mystery game go play no questions isn't really enticing except to very specific people. so i tend to tell people that it's not quite for everyone, but it is highly, highly acclaimed, so it's worth checking out even if there's a chance you won't like it, because if you do the payoff will be so worth it. the optimal way to experience it is to go in completely blind, not knowing the genre or any of the mechanics, but if you're not sold then !it's an open world game based around exploration and discovery, where you're caught in a time loop and have to keep reliving the same twenty minutes in real time until you discover how to break the loop! e i can't tell if this somehow pissed a lot of you off for some unknown reason, or like one person got really upset that i didn't perfectly match their personal viewpoint on this. but i stand by everything i said. the absolute best way to experience this game is to go in blind, however it may not be the best pitch to convince people to try this game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,god damn only redditors could whine about being reccomended a game .. the wrong way? yeesh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,any other games that also fall into the genre?sounds like a very specific category and have no idea if id like that kind of game lol but my internet is piqued.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i mean, like, it's an exploration game set in a sun system, you're a little alien dude who gets a spaceship and needs to research all the other planets and find out their secrets and history. it's 3d first person, in a cartoony style. that's the intro you get. that's enough to know if you want to play it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"the less you know the better, go play it i was like this with disco elysium. got it as part of humble bundlechoice. went in blind and one of the best story experiences i've had ina long while."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that suggestion is only useful if they are 40.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"if people arent properly calibrated for a narrative based mystery story, where you do need to read everything and its not just meaningless flavor text, things wont go so well at first. expectations play a huge part in how you experience pretty much everything. even with things you eat or drink, if you're expecting them to taste different than what they are, there's a very good chance that it will disgust you, and games are really no different."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,at least you didnt quit because the ship was difficult to control lol. it blows my mind how often ive seen that comment on reddit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,were you trying to survive a little too long
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i think this was a common response for sure. the game lore does explain it more as you talk to npcs but it's a legit complaint that someone might feel they're not doing something they should to prevent that thing from happening.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,yes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"there's a specific sequence of actions you have to take to complete the game. you can take those actions right from the start, and doing so only takes ten minutes, but you have to play the game to find out what those actions are. indeed, i'd argue that what is the goal of this game? is one of its biggest puzzles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,you mean lucas pope? but yeah absolutely could even have room for other artifacts down the line other than the memento mort
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i want that mechanic in every batman game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"second this, it's an awesome game. i was skeptical that any game could scratch the obra dinn itch, but i just finished cos and i was very impressed."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i also disliked the end when i played it but ended up watching a video on video games with bad endings that mentions firewatch. the game is an analogy for grief and how we deal with it  you watch your wife get early onset dementia, no matter what choice you pick in the intro, she is taken away, and your character is a mess. the whole game is just an escape, your character running away from his depressing reality. the story is reflected in the story of brian goodwin and his dad, too. the fire forces you to snap back to reality. honestly it's still an underwhelming ending with the conspiracy being nothing but knowing why it's so unsatisfying makes me appreciate the ending more the video about games with unsatisfying endingshttpsyoutu.be3kwc6axgode?si8h7wv9oslltqkn1t"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it's wild cause act 1 lasts like 1 or 2 hours max. the best part of the game is over almost instantly

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"yeah, it is fine and original, but inside is above in all aspects. limbo is good original platformer, inside is just perfect little game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"it was all filler, after doing one type of merlin trial they become incredibly boring and repetitive. if the trials don't increase in difficulty or vary greatly in execution it's just filler designed to artificially inflate gameplay time. they should have focused on more story elements and wiped out the repetitive tacked on rpg elements completely."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i think i beat resident evil 4 more than 10 times on the wii when i was young xd. i just couldnt stop enjoying the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"replaying the same day in wordle is the same thing as replaying the same level in every other game ever. that is willfully ignoring the intent of the question. hollow knight is not very replayable if you never reach dirtmouth. rts are very repetitive if you only ever play the first mission with 10 of buildings and units. i am not answering the latest in the thread because this would be drowned, but i saw your comparison to the kid and egg question. if that is all wordle was, then sure it is repetitive. but the idea is that you tell the lkid a new riddle the next day, aka level 2. just because you have to wait till the next day doesn't change that. plus there are infinite wordles out there as well that generate a new word at the press of a button but are still called wordle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that doesn't make it not replayable. that makes replaying in a single day pointless.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"on paper, every aspect of the game is something that i generally have no interest in. walking simulators, the mechanic behind the core gameplay loop, strict timesensitive requirements... the only thing the game had going for it was space, and even that was not quite what i was hoping for when going in. one of the top 5 games i've played."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,might still be worth a shot. the story and puzzle aspects are completely unlike anything else i've played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the forest is a survival game, right? outer wilds is a pure adventure game, you never really lose progress. it's not about try 10 things and see what works although that can be fun too but it's about figuring stuff out by exploring and putting together the clues."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,its nothing like the forest but it hurts my soul to see that you dont like the forest. thats the only survival game ive ever liked and goddamn do i love it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,only redditors can wine about.. wining? yeesh.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"this is a very hard question to answer because it has some aspects that are similar to other games but no game that has everything it has. specifically aspects like these 1. a handcrafted world well, solar system where everything is placed for a reason, there's no random hallways or things like that. a lot of spectacles and cool things to discover that will make you go woah or no way. the worlds also change over time rather than being static. the worlds are also all very different in ways i can't explain without straightup spoiling, but only the one you start on can be called earthlike. 2. no combat, but fun and fluid movement with planets have different gravity, jetpacks, a ship you can manually fly to everywhere. it's just a blast to move around and you have to get better at it over time. 3. selfdirected. you've got notes in your ship logs about things that might be useful to investigate, but they kind of just point you in a direction. even figuring out what you're trying to do takes time and is all on you, there's no cutscene or point where someone directly tells you. however, if you want to know if you like this kind of game, i'd mostly trust looking at whether you like puzzle games like the witness, return of the obra dinn, antichamber, heaven's vault. these are games that require the player to try really hard to figure things out, but the things you have to figure out are fair. these games aren't the same as what makes outer wilds special but they scratch a similar kind of itch. in short, though, the one thing this game requires curiosity."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"in addition to what the other guy said i also often describe it as a archaeological detective game. you try to piece things together by reading small bits from an old civilization. the ship log the guy was talking about is not like a boring list of text, but like one of those crazy detective walls with strings and pictures like you see in movies."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"haha youre not wrong. generally id give an explanation of what myst is like then too. the point is i would explain outer wilds the same way i would explain myst, just without any specifics beyond, hey space is cool and you can go anywhere in a whole solar system. i think that not knowing anything about the game is a lot to ask of new players."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"hey thats rude, im 35 and i know exactly what myst is"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i think this is a big part of why fans often tell others to go in completely blind on this one. hear me out... if you're one of the people who really loves this game, to the point that you're tearing up at the soundtrack months later and recommending it in every remotely relevant reddit thread, there's probably not a lot that compares to outer wild's peculiar combination of mechanical and emotional experiences. as a result, it's hard to set expectations appropriately for this game. a vague description of its mechanics would put it closest to a relatively niche adventure puzzle genre that a lot of people are just going to pass on, while fans of that genre are going to find something that doesn't quite line up with other games they've enjoyed. its primary ludonarrative conceit sort of just sounds like a gimmick. its story is, in terms of strict prose narrative, not hard to mistake for a collection of scifi tropes, and hard to describe without undermining moments that are intended to get their power from a sense of wonder. and i think that's sort of the crux of it. in a way, this is a game about that sense of wonder. all of the things that make most games great, like tight action mechanics or brain burning puzzles or an epic narrative, are just maybe a little better than fine in this one. but if you have an open mind about it, and the game really clicks for you, it absolutely nails this other kind of experience that most games aren't even really trying to achieve. that's very, very hard to get across, especially in a way that doesn't create some other expectation in the listener, and without sounding like an absolute crazy person, as i'm sure i do to many here. hence the recommendation from many to treat this like a food you've never had anything like. to have the best shot at experiencing what its fans have experienced, have no expectations, and let it show you its own virtues. all of that said, i totally understand the hesitation to go into a 20 hour game, let alone purchase that game, completely blind. recommendations are just always going to be a tricky thing for this game's fans to navigate."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,seriously?! people find it hard? i thought it was really good controls and the ship was really responsive. unless people just blasted full throttle and crashed into the attlerock cause weve all done that at least once.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,im one of them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i spent most of my first in game day practicing flight controls with the model ship. eventually i was comfortable with the flight and got all the achievements. the couple involving the model and the manually flying to that one destination. it's not as forgiving a mechanic as most games give you. like turning off speed adjustment assistance in the forza games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"oh wait, seriously? ive been trying to play through the game for a while, and while ive filled out most of the ships logs, i was never quite sure on what do or where to go specifically to find the next piece of information, as i figured it was going to slowly tell me where to go, what to do. so youre saying i have to look over the ships logs that i already have, and surmise what to do from that?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,my wife and i played and i refused to guess. i kept swearing that they wouldn't make it so we had to guess and there had to be a clue somewhere. we wandered back and forth between scenes for fucking days before finally figuring out the numbers and clothes. my wife didn't like my i told you so.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,except in this case it's probably never coming
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"facts, dont get wrong i was definitely suprised when the act 2 began but i just couldn't get into it and ended up shelfing it. act 1 was just so fucking great that doing anything else besides felt watered down, the change in art style was such a fucking let down too. its not bad or anything but again, thay act1 is just that good i wished the entire game was like that"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"quantum break i think can't be because microsoft own the ip. but the licence could expire and revert to remedy, which is what happened to alan wake. max payne is owned by rockstar but in the rcu there's a max payneadjacent character called alex casey, who is the star of a series of novels written by alan wake. in aw2, casey shows up in game, played by remedy writer sam lake, who played max payne in the original game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"ellie was established to be gay long before part 2. of course, like any straight game protagonist in a semirealistic story, she was always bound to have some kind of relationship. half of uncharted 4 is about nate's marriage. and then abby is entirely unpolitical  she'd be exactly the same character if she were a man. i'm not surprised that you haven't played the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,sorry for the downvotes  sometimes the truth hurts
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,omg this upset me so bad
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,mine had a ps5 upgrade i did the air tubes only go 100m
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,still the first.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the only thing the 2nd one has in its corner is graphics. it more technically impressive. however the map is much smaller, the creatures are less varied, the sound design is worse, and the building mechanics aren't as well realized. technically alot of subnautica 2 is on land. whereas sub 1 is basically 99 the sea."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,this was my problem with it. the brooms were fun at first too but brooms all being the same were incredibly disappointing considering how much time goes into getting new brooms. i feel the same way about jedi fallen order and survivor lightsaber parts.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"replaying today's wordle tomorrow would also be pointless. so would replaying it in a week. if the fact that wordle makes a new game every day confuses you, then think about a riddle a word puzzle of sorts. it is pointless to replay a riddle, because you already know the answer. now apply this to a puzzle game where you remember the solutions easily. less fun playing it than it was the first time, no?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i don't think i'd call it a walking simulator. unless we're going to start calling platformers walking simulators. the platforming and flight is pretty forgiving unless you're going for the achievements, but it will absolutely still kill you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,yea correct  ok that makes sense i think i would enjoy a puzzle game much more than a survival game  thanks!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,its still installed on the console because i want to give it a shot  but i think i need to look up some tips and tricks..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,wow thank you for this detailed response! i havent had the mental capacity to game as much as i used to but have been wanting to try out more puzzle based games and this sounds like a really intriguing game overall so ill have to try it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"i get the analogy to the witness  the first time a line puzzle happened outside of a board was like a wtf moment. i couldnt find anything in the outer wilds through the first couple of loops that captured that same feeling, i honestly just moved on to other games. maybe it was the graphics, not sure i just couldnt do it. i still dont get it or what the appeal is of the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"finally. i also really did not enjoy the game. i went in blind like everyone said and was expecting something epic spoiler warning to me it was not fun at all as i hate walking simulator type games. the core gameplay mechanic of restarting made me so mad because it took me like 3 resets to figure out my progress was completely reset. once i did i just stopped playing and watched a walkthrough. i didnt even find the walkthrough that exciting  overall, it is just really not my kind of game. i liked the soundtrack though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"i didnt enjoy the story. i have a hard time reconciling comments that point towards the story being great, when in my experience, the story pretty much told itself at the realization of one of the games primary mechanics. iykyk. i greatly preferred subnautica in terms of exploring to understand the story. ow was entirely underwhelming in nearly every facet  including game play and visuals."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,or flown right into the sun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,it'd be interesting to see how much those complaints line up with those who used mousekeyboard over a controller. the game recommends a controller.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"took me a while to get used to the actual physics of spaceflight and start decelerating early enough to not smash into my destination or overshoot it by a dozen kilometers. other than that, flying the ship is great."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"basically, yes. this game doesn't hold your hand whatsoever. though, if you really have filled out your ship log the answer should be pretty clear at that point. your log will tell you if haven't found everything on a planet. might want to double check you haven't missed something."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"yeah, it's a very openended game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"fast forward to 2031 game was delayed due to a fire at work, most of the dev team came out alive except for 1. delay time is still unknown.."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"yes, but its an issue widely talked about within the gaming community. theres no way a gamer hasnt heard of the controversy and if you have to ask for specific examples it probably means you are looking for a debate when its been made clear over and over the people who think there arent divisive politics pushed into modern games wont change their minds no matter the evidence because they agree with the politics being pushed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"the wolf vs scar conflict was written to parallel the israel vs palestine conflict, abbys character was very political, just not in the way these people mention, saying shes entirely unpoloticial is ill informed. abby is supposed to represent a wolf israeli who starts off on day 1 wanting all scars palestinians deadbragging about being top scar killer and saying scar kids deserves to die, then ends up being saved by scars as isaac goes genocidal and flips to just wanting to save her people and not taking sides. they also portray the wolf's as a superior military  organized while making the scars the border the line between freedom fighter and terrorist. not a fan take either, druckman is jewishisraeli and has said as much. and with what's going in recently its more relevant than ever"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"abby, a girl who lived in a room next door to a big functional gym, in a post apocalypse world. being ripped and jacked  political? yeah, sure"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,that and the seatruck. i know i'm alone in this but i thought the seatruck was a massive improvement over the cyclops. if i could somehow put the truck into sub 1 i'd never touch sub 2 again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,same with the bad ass mounts you can fly that ended up being a huge downgrade from the broom.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"same thing with different wand elements. it's all just a tiny minor cosmetic change otherwise you'll see nothing change stat wise. kind of a bummer too as we could have had a system of swapping out different parts for small bonuses to stats or certain spells. instead they just said nah, it's all just for looks, nothing more..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"you're looking at each daily puzzle as being a unique game. and the are, within the game itself, but they arent different games. wordle itself is the game. the puzzles are part of that game. so each time you play wordle on a different day, you are in fact replaying the game wordle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,it was more my initial impression of the game given the lack of detail going around than what the game actually is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,it's not nearly as hard or as difficult as you seem to have gotten the impression of from other sources.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"fair enough. out of curiosity, how far into the game did you get before you decided enough was enough? interestingly, i also fucking hate walking simulator games, but i loved this one. for whatever reason, i dont categorize it with other walking simulator games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"you did not experience the story. i'm not telling you you have any obligation to if what you experienced wasn't enjoyable, but based on your comments, i don't think your criticism that the story is weak and predictable is valid, because if you think the story is told at the realization of the initial mechanics, then you did not play enough to genuinely experience the story."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,agreed. subanutica was an amazing experience. ow was one big meh to me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"it still controls really well with kbm, but certain parts are harder. which is unfortunate, because one of the parts that is harder is the penultimate area."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"im still missing some info on the one planet that falls apart as time goes on, i think its like the sunless city or something? it says im missing info but the area is so huge that its nearly impossible to find what im missing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"well, yeah, naturally, most people who're fans know about the israelpalestine symbolism. it's pretty clearly at the surface of the subtext. i've played both games a handful of times over, i own the artbooks, i'm a fan. when i said that abby is entirely unpolitical, i was speaking in relation to the specific context of the incel talkingpoints that we've all heard a million times over which are only ever tied to western socialpolitical affairs  culture wars dialogue. these people are never referring to the actual scope of political storytelling. if they were, they'd be complaining about cod, farcry, and fallout."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,"ive seen so many bad takes in tlou2, like how abby is transgender and thus ruined the game, ellie is suddenly gay and ruined the game, how the game ruined joel because his personality isnt the same as 5 years ago, or my favorite from tlou2 subreddit. the gameplay is shit and bad because theres lgbt flag in one of the section of the game but this takes the cake lmao"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,the struck is technically better but the cyclops was the very thing i always want in a game. a giant mobile base!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,i much preferred the cyclops. it was chunkier sure. but that big clunky machine felt like entering a tank and felt safe.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"alright, let's leave aside the fact that i disagree with that entirely, because the specific example is really not necessary for my point and i don't want to get bogged down in arguing about why each new wordle iteration is considered the same game, while each new mario iteration is considered a different game. forget i said wordle and let's take a different example a simple word game i might give a child what has to be broken before you can use it? the child might think for a while and eventually realise the answer is an egg. they'll be happy with their realisation, and have enjoyed the game. the next day i give them the same riddle. do you think they'll enjoy it as much?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,i played it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"mega spoilers maybe? for anyone who has not played the game yet. i played probably 6 hours.not sure tbh honestly it was probably less but it felt like forever i visited each planet at least once. made it into, and land on the angler fish planet. made it to the core of the collapsing planet. the twin sand planet met up with that satellite you see in the very beginning i did a lot. i found myself pushing myself to continue because i really did not enjoy it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,how is it a bad take? druckman outright said the wolf's scar conflict is inspired by the israelpalestine conflict
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"welcome aboard, captain."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"the very next day, likely not. now come back and ask them a year later or 5 years later. you're still stuck in the same thing by defining a small part of the game as the game itself. you are defining a single riddle as being the biggest part, when asking riddles is the game, and individual riddles are a small part of it of the overall game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-21,ive watched a lot of markipliers playthrough  it was a really fun watch
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,all systems online.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-20,"no, i'm not. the word riddle can refer to two things 1. an individual puzzle, which does not repeat or vary. for example, the egg one i gave above. 2. a genre of game. all word puzzles are riddles. when talking about a specific videogame such as zelda for example, this is analogous to the first. the game does not vary or change, it is always the same when repeated. i do not get to call every different version of zelda, with all their differences, the same game, just because they are all the same genre. neither can i say that i am playing riddle whenever i solve any word puzzle. the extreme example of the riddle is to make a point any game which is based on nonreplicable experiences such as solving a puzzle, or seeing something for the first time will be a lesser experience when replayed. a riddle is 100 based on such an experience, which is why it cannot be replayed. a game like zelda is perhaps only 10 based on those things there's also cinematics, gameplay, etc so it is still very replayable  but perhaps less than something like call of duty, which is based purely on gaming and not on problemsolving at all. that's what the topic is about. it is not helpful to say all games can be replayed. it's technically true, of course, but the experience will be superior or inferior depending on the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"is limbo worth getting? im debating whether or not to get it. edit ok, i went ahead and bought it with 2 minutes to spare! i had to fight my cc company to clear the charge at the last minute because they keep declining legitimate purchases."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,been a pretty depressing holiday season. i have a feeling this game would set me over the edge.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,today i learned that limbo is on sale for 2.49 on steam. checked my bank account 2.01 to my name.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"oh, man! i jumped out of my seat the first time i played that game. i was at my friend's place and he had cranked up the volume. that thump as my head caved in for the first time in the game scared the shitspoiler out of me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i just wanted to use this boxspoiler
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,at this point i wasn't paying attention earlier and thought i could only get past by jumping on the leg. i died innumerable times. probably 20.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"ahh i haven't finished it but that section was fucking incredible. not scary, but the entire atmosphere is so gloomy every time the spider moved it felt fucking uncomfortable. such an awesome mood and game so far, the spider is done so perfectly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,is it on steam?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"my biggest problem was simply being chased by the spider across the pond and using the seesaw to get away. my timing was absolutely terrible on the jumps and it took forever. i also thought i was supposed to kill the glowing brain slugs by getting stuck in the sunlight, which took forever to try achievingspoiler"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,good. because that fucker doesn't leave you alone for half the game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i just picked it up as well. i was actually really looking forward to this going on sale after i played the demo. hopefully i'll make a little more progress than you did.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yeah, i stopped playing my first playthrough at that point. a friend came over later, so i restarted and never stopped until we finished it. sooooo good. also that last jump is a crazy mindbender."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i've never felt so pretentiously awestruck as when i finished this game. i loved every moment of it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"come on, this ain't amnesia"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"i actually didn't like it. the backdrop and atmosphere are cool and all, but when it boils down to it limbo is a game of repetition. there are obstacles and traps you will never be able to avoid the first time and some can take half a dozen or more attempts to beat. i don't like this design, it wreaks of laziness. i much prefer having a challenging experience that gives me some satisfaction for solving rather than thinking finally i got past it, that was annoying."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,did you get past it? just brought it me self...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"oh god, why did i buy it?  hates spiders"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i felt like quitting limbo at about the point the first worm thing showed up. something about that and everything that lead up to it made me feel sick. i did eventually go back to the game and beat it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i have only played the demo of this game when it first came out on xbox months ago and yet i still managed to predict what this would be. let me guess. the spider. i just hope he didn't oh good. no fire or rage faces good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"not gonna lie.. got to the same part, quit forever."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,you should try playing amnesia instead.httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vezjgzcxpuc
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"never played the game, but your picture made me think of thishttpwww.youtube.comwatch?featureplayerdetailpagevloqyw49saqct105s."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i stopped here too haha until the next day p
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i warned everyone about that damn spider.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,jealous. my friend says its like a 2d amnesia but even more beautiful. i look forward to purchasing it if no one gifts it to me for mas
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"got that far in the demo, blindly tried to keep running. why can't i keep runn  oh dear lord no."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-01,"at first i thought this was a haunted tree or something. when i counted the number of legs on the giant spider, i noticed that it only had 5 legs 3 were missing. then it dawned on me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i feel by putting horrible spiders, or indeed spiderlike creatures in games ruins it for people the spider in this game for example, the corpser in gears of war, the flood in halo kinda and the list goes on, just picking some off to the top of my head there, but really i freakin hate spiders and they ruin games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yep. i'd heard a lot of good things about limbo, and i generally love indie games seriously, most of my steam library is indie games. so i downloaded the demo, and i was absolutely loving it until... that. got that weak feeling in my knees, my skin started to crawl... exit right click  delete local content it made me rather sad. i really wanted to play that game. i still do. but it's not going to happen."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i've noticed a worrying trend on this subreddit that seems like a contest to earn the title of the biggest pussy, with games such as this and amnesia."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,pull the spider legs out to kill him!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"limbo's not even supposed to be scary you baby! it's supposed to be dark, contrasting the stereotypical child's view of reality."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,the whole segment with the spider is one big nopefest
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i nope'd my way right out of that part too. i think i'm going to play this game during the day from now on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,don't understand the love for this game. one of those things where i just look at all the kudos and go huh?!?!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i don't like it at all. it's boring.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"don't worry, you kill the shit out of that spider."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"you. yes, you op. you are shit, and a pussy at that. limbo isn't even a fucking scary game. now, get your head out of your ass and realize the game your playing is one of the shittiest platformers around."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"really? i don't understand how people can be scared when you just respawn a few seconds earlier. same with crap like dead space. these games aren't scarey, nor do they require any kind of skill. it is effectively a horrible game, it is basically redoing the last few seconds until you get it right."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"absolutely. i've played if at a friends house, finished it in two sessions and it was great. yeah, it is short but every puzzle felt new, challenging and had an interesting solution."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,limbo is a hell of a game. it seems a little short but some of the puzzles are pretty fun to figure out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,yes! do it now while it's still 2.50. one of the most creative and best games i've played in a while.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yes! i bought it on my 360 right when it came out, it's an amazing platformer, errie, and very original."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"okay, well people have stated all the reasons to get it. here's my opinion the game has a very unique atmosphere and each area does have a unique feel, but the game is very short and has little replay. also i found it's method of presenting puzzles to be pretty irksome at times, as parts tended to be trial and error mind you 1 error was often enough to figure it out. overall if you're really interested, i'd say  5 is worth it. although honestly, i feel there are a lot of other great indie games around that same price range which i would recommend before limbo. flutterblush i hope my review isn't regarded as too harsh..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yes, get it! it's a fantastic game and a lot of fun."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"please buy it! i paid 10.00 for it and loved it. i've bought it for 3 friends  2.50, just to spread the love. and to support the dev's in hopes of a limbo 2."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yes, it is. i got it on xbla a while ago. i find myself replaying it a lot just because it was such a good game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,worth the 2 euros
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"for 2.50? absolutely without a doubt. it was iffy at 10 given the length, but for the price of an iphone app, unquestionably so. the atmosphere, minimalist story, set design all are without parallel."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"2 minutes to spare? the daily deal on it doesn't end for another 3.5 hours. they last for 4 hours after the new deals come up, it's still 2.50."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"just for the record it has just about zero replayability. if you played it once, you're done with it, unless you want to replay it later again because you enjoyed it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"actually, the daily deals go from 1pm est to 5pm est they're at the bottom from 15 under ending soon"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,for 2.50 how could you not buy this game? it's worth that price for sure. i bought it about 3 weeks ago and i loved it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"not that you need any more convincing, but just freakin do it. one of the most immersive games ever and currently costs less than a latte. what u waitin for bro?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,if you've played the old ps1 game heart of darkness it is a fairly faithful clone of that game without any combat and with a much more minimalistic art style. i wouldn't say it's as good as heart of darkness but it's definitely worth playing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,it's so worth it. i got it one night and played it until 10 am the next morning. so much fun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i missed it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"no, it's trite, stupid, and i've quite literally played better games in shitty flash knockoffs. don't fall for the hype, unless you're one of those shitheads who worries about the experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yeah, debating is cool and all and i'ma let you finish, but limbo is one of my favorite xbla games of all time!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,the worst for me was the first living person you come across.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"itt spoilers, jeeze!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i thought those slugs were a cheap mechanic. it's a way for the level designers to better control how you move through the space to solve the puzzle. don't get me wrong, the puzzles were clever and well done, but it was pretty transparent what they were getting at. at that point it became really 'gamey' and less explorey."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,haha that got me too. then a couple more times when i had to run back over them to escape p

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,have you played hardcore in dead space 2? 3 saves for the entire game. tell me dying isn't scary in that when you can get bumped back 4 chapters.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,same with crap like dead space. looks like somebody played on easy instead of harcore.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"also, there's nothing like luring candle headed babies into deathtraps."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"that's the great thing about the game and why i hate it when people moan about this game being short. they'd probably moan if the game was twice as long and the puzzles were repeated. each puzzle is unique and well thought out. i really enjoyed this game, the spider challenges and just after this were the best bits, the game got a little weary and frustrating with the reverse gravity puzzles and i'd have liked a slightly more satisfying ending but i'd have no hesitation in recommending this game to anyone. beautiful art styling"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i concur.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,the 2.50 is definitely worth to experience the creativity put into the game. get it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,i loved the game and think it was worth the 15 i paid for it but it's nice to see the other side. cutealoo not too harsh at all
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i bought extra copies to gift when it was the daily sale last week. it's a great game, and at that price it's cheap enough to share the love."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"eeewwww, no. limbo does not need a sequel, it would ruin the magic. i wouldn't mind another beautifully styled, enigmatic puzzle game, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"yeah i thought the deals ended at 1 when the new ones roll out. in the past, they always have switched with the new ones rather than stay for a few more hours."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,that is the only reason i replay a game..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i've replayed it a couple of times. it has come back appeal when your in the mood for something a little dark and gloomy... and considering how cheap it is 2.49 on steam for the next 4 hours or so, it's still good value if you invest 3 or 4 hours on it and never play it again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,this game sucked. i'm gonna play it again! your statement confuses me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"if you didn't collect all the eggs, its replayable for sure. just dont know how enjoyable its gonna be."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"no no no... there are plenty of easter eggs to find, and once you unlock every achievement, you get new content! if you're playing on steam or ps3"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i call shenanigans. i sank 25 hours into limbo. first, the usual run through. second, for a walkthrough. third, for all of the eggs. fourth, to play along with the girlfriend. fifth, to get the no point in dying achievement. it has as much replay value as you want it to be. limbo has become that game to me where i go eh, i'm bored and have a little bit of time, maybe i'll run through it and kill 50 minutes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-15,"well, this happens a lot with the games i buy. i just give it reasonable time to forget the puzzles a couple of years and replay it. examples cog, spacechem, machinarium, monkey island, psychonauts, etc."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"i think he means replaying it only because it was good rather than because there's more things to do. you might replay a game to beat your high score or play the evil route instead of the good one, or you might just replay it because you have nothing better to do and you remember it was fun."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"well some games have multiple difficulty modes or multiple story paths. some games are just fun to replay anyway such as a mario game. this isn't one of them because it's based on solving puzzles, once you know the solution to the puzzle there's no more fun to be had. that's a problem with the whole genre though, so i don't consider it to be a legitimate complaint in this case. if limbo was 60 new then yeah, i'd be complaining but that was never the case."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"hm, i might be able to make it then. i was worried it was a recurring enemy. my arachnophobia is very intense and coupled with my anxiety disorder, there's a real danger of passing out or having a panic attack which feels something like a heart attack and lasts around half an hour. i can overpower my fear of heights to play a game. fear of spiders... not so much."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-01-04,did you beat the game yet? i thought it was pretty good and cute.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"fair enough, you're of course entitled to your opinion. but personally, while there was a lot left to be desired and the trial and error process got annoying at times i had a lot of fun playing through it. and that spider of course was creepy as fuck. i played that game throughout with the lights off and the sound turned way up so it was great atmosphere."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,lamest. shit. ever.....
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-14,"thanks! lots of time with an xacto knife  razor and careful scraping with a big metal spoon from both the inside and outside to make some areas as thin as possible without breaking through. edit i also worked in the dark and kept a flashlight on inside the pumpkin to get an idea of how much light was shining through the thinner parts. the eyes were done with a small drill bit all the way through. edit 2 here's the other one i madehttpi.imgur.comkfj40.jpg. i got a little burnt out after the first one so i made something a little less complicated. edit 3 thanks for all the positive feedback, folks. means a lot. this got buried somewhere in the comments, but here's a video of the first one with the flickering lightshttpwww.youtube.comwatch?vrzfukgfdilm and limbo music for the full effect."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,i did thesehttpimgur.comazxwzf with clay carving loops and exacto blades last year. unfortunately my pumpkin was rotting out when i started carving into it so the whole thing became translucent.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,"same way i did thishttpi.imgur.comgm3z5.jpg hackjob a few years ago it's supposed to be a gargoyle on a pumpkin, submitted it to the yearly blizzard contest and only got honourable mention unfortunately. you use the very outer opaque layer that's only a millimeter thick or so as your completely black spots, and then for areas you want varying shades of light for, you peel that skin off and then dig away at the pumpkin to achieve various thickness's. that's how i managed to make the wings look more realistic hell, they are probably the only thing on that carving that was actually visually recognizable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,just when the nightmares had ended... following the link to op's youtube didn't help shudder that music brought it all back.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,"i do the same, except while handing out candy, with a insane look on my face. i get alot of leftover goodies."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-14,"i don't get it either, i see people post with titles like that all the time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,"that's the thing, once something becomes widely accepted, people start to hate it. like people using the word 'gem' in their post, or 'level', etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-15,"in my opinion, posts that reference other posts are ridiculous. instead of posting in the comments for that original post, which makes much more sense logically, it's clear that the op of the followup just wanted to make sure that more people saw it. not a big problem, but it means that anytime there is a significant post front pages get flooded with i see your... posts. your pumpkin is sick, but to make a new post referencing an existing post as its stepping stone seems tacky."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-14,thanks very much. whoever made the ico pumpkin did an amazing job keeping those light and dark values consistent. very clean.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,my friends and i
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,why do these devs never tell us the name of the game? i swear they do it on purpose.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,me spent four years or i spent four years?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"dawg, all these indie games are the same. why do people waste their time remaking the same side scroller? oh, check this one out guys, it has strings!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"sidescrolling indie walking simulator about a child in a scary world? wow, how original"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,so it's a regular game but you can't go under stuff ?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"a small child, scary world side scroller? well, i know a bunch of people sure would love to see more of those."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what do i think? i think you should pay for ad space instead of making shill posts.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,my friends and i
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,another promotion post about a shitty indie game whowouldathought?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,it looks like every other game that someone worked on that gets posted on here.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks similar to inside and limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks like shite mate
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks extremely mediocre
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i think this is a paid for ad and i hate it even if you might have a good game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,my friends and i
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i started the clip with cool, idea, will the string be affected by then immediately her strings get stuck when she tried to get under something and felt satisfied that my question was answered before i even fully asked it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,..couldn't you just do this without strings?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this sub looks like it's been taken over by bots. indy games are something that this sub should be all about.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"what took you four years? looks like you stole the conceptdesignthemeplaystyleenemies from limbo, inside, little nightmares. what else did you have to do lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i think thats a shame you wasted all that time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i think you should pay for advertising placements like everyone else

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,pinocchio become human looking awesome af
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"typical sidescroller with mild horror elements. literally the only interesting thing is the strings which seems like it isn't very deep at all, and would just be a gimmick in the end"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i think it looks highly derivative of many other games within this genre. the only thing that sets it apart from the multitude of other such games is the fact that you play as a marionette.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,my friends and i thatguy.png congrats on the game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"great paid ad, comments, and awards. game looks like a mediocre platformer tho, pass"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks lame ngl
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what's the importance of the marionette aspect? seems like it's just a sidescroller with a bunch of lines connecting the characters to the top of the screen.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,congrats. the most important feature of a game is shipping and you about to do that !!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,can't wait for this to be uploaded on steamunlocked or fitgirl. probably never play it but hey.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,why would they leave out the name and platforms?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"me spent 4 years working on a game... sounds dumb right? it's because you're using the wrong personal pronoun. i spent 4 years working on a game... much better when you use the right personal pronoun. then you can add your friends into the mix my friends and i spent 4 years working on a game... when you're not the subject of the sentence, use me. this game was made for me. the list of developers of this game includes me. when you are the subject of the sentence, use i. i made a game., i like this game. etc. when it's a compound subject, the same rules apply, you just have to break down the compound subject into individual subjects. this is a picture of my friend and me. my friend and i took this picture, etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"released in an hour and you're asking for feedback now?? i hate to say it but that's cutting it a little close for corrections.... seriously though it looks awesome, congratulations on your release!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"you posted that video of your game progress over the years, as it was evolving. thought it looked great, and the finished product looks very atmospheric. i will definitely check it out! best of luck with the game sales!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,whats the name? also is it gonna be on steam?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"virtually every arty indie game is basically about a small child being lost in a scary world, probably because they're frequently made by tech nerds new to the industry, having to face the fact that it might finally be time to get a real job and figure out how to do their own laundry. which also explains why the games are usually highly unsubtle metaphors for something from the standard list of tech nerd mental health issues anxiety, depression, isolation, the fact that nice girls don't want to touch them.  zero punctuationhttpsyoutu.be305cjwvik?t42"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,coll and i hope it went great. but this post is just and ad and sorry to say but the game looks like has nothing different from previous similar ones dude

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i think the game looks like shit, you paid bots to upvote this post, and 99 of the comments were written by you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,boring as hell
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i wonder how much these reddit advertisement campaigns cost. casual i quit my job and lived with buddhist monks for 20 years before i could start developing this game that took 5 years of work but i'm not gonna tell you guys the name, i'll wait for random comments to tell you where to find it so it looks organic cringe."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"at just a glance this seems deeply philosophical, you have to consider not just yourself, but the strings that move you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,wow

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"this is astoundingly beautiful, great job!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,been looking forward to this. reminded me alil of limbo but with the puppet string mechanic. excited to see how the strings will interact with puzzles. picking it up on ps5
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,the art in this game looks incredible.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,whats it called????
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what do the strings add to the game to make it substantially unique from other side scrolls?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"looks good. so do the marionette strings actually play a part in the mechanics? like do you actually manipulate them to get over obstacles, or do they impede progress in parts due to their length? my daughter and i really loved the unravel games, and this sort of looks up her alley."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,do you control movements by pulling on the strings or is that an artistic flare?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this looks really cool. like the art style as well. use unity?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,its like limbo but with colour. looks great to be honest. good job done.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,unreal  unity?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what is the game called
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,please tell me it's called super marionette world.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks like any other game but with strings above the character. the overall animation you chose looks nice. familiar to other games i cant think of off the top of my head. but oddly original. but do the marionette strings actually work as a marionette puppet to move the character? if so that seems awkward and if not it seems like you could have created the same game without the marionette theme. basically just taking the strings off the characters. if it mechanically does work like marionette strings it would take playing it to get the feel for the game in order to decide if i like the game play. the overall look of the game looks great tho animation wise.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,whats this? an indie game advertisement on rgaming that actually looks good? no way!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it would be nice if all of the characters actually looked like marionettes instead of simple, cartoonist figures attached to random strings seemingly reaching up into nothingness."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,is master of puppets the bgm
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this is super cool being that marionettes were like the v.1.0 of video game characters and to see it come around full circle is pretty awesome!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what console?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks like someone is going to be a big shot!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,salute and respect for your friends too..!! me and my 2 friends started web hosting service project in 2009. we launched it and stopped giving time after some days because the company wasnt making any money lol!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"the concept of controlling a marionette in a video game seems... redundant... regardless, the game looks pretty cool, well done."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"wow a gimmicky artsy side scroller, how thrilling nah"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,buying this after work. this looks like living art!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,how do i play this?!?!?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i think i'ma play limbo, inside, or lil nightmares after work"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks amazing  congratulations
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"not a gamer, but i find the artwork and lighting work to be incredible. i havent played a game since crash bandicoot warped ... but id play this for the artwork alone... cool shit"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"so, do the strings actually introduce an interesting mechanical option that must be accounted for or do they just function as an interesting background detail that you'll soon forget about in an otherwise relatively simplistic 2d sidescroller until such time as the story ends up going south and the marionette's strings are literally cut as a narrative way to say there are no strings on you now! go make the story 'correct'! and thus ultimately serve little to no mechanical purpose?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"from what i see here i can't tell you if it will be fun to play, but looks amazing!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,were you guys inspired by inside at all?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i understand the string stuff is meant to make it uniqe, but imo it would be way better without. the only time it looked good during this was on the bear, other than that it was just distracting. game would look awesome without."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,my eyes are bad and read that as meteorites  was confused.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"congrats, next step is to get it reviewed as much as possible. makes people who're curious know what they need, and makes people who don't know the game get an introduction."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i think aesthetically its a little weird to see what seems to be infinitely long strings on marionettes. two ways to fix that might be either to have the strings fade as they go far enough up or to have a stylize overlay of theater curtains at the top and sides of the screen making the whole thing somewhat of a puppet show while causing there to be a visual termination of the strings.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,its beautiful
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,my friends and i sorry cool concept
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,cool! are there any strings attached?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,should release it on gamepass! it would do really well

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i feel like the eula might have some strings attached...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,would be cool to have a game mode where an additional phone could be used to control the puppet as if it is connected to virtual strings attached to this second phone. remote puppeteer so to speakor even more than one remoteto play together with your partner on multiple puppets in one scene for kids to enjoy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"visually, that is beautiful"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,visually i think it looks very good. is there a unique control mechanic? like having to control the strings rather than the character directly?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,it looks great! i would definitely play it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,linky link link link?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i don't think it looks like anything special. a standard side scroller with the added bonus of strings that look like graphic artifacts.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,think it was a waste of 4 years
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,love the art style
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,well holy shit that looks epic

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"creating a game for a long time and then publishing it, should be something of indescribable"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what's it called?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,im thinking if you want the game to succeed you should probably mention the name of the game you are trying to promote.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,when i saw the first 1 or 2 episodes of spongebob i thought it would never take off because it was silly having a grill or sink full of dishes or a campfire under the water. so i'm not the right person to ask about this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"gj. looks good! regardless of how it sells, its the journey and experience that matters and it should help in the future in some way"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this looks gorgeous!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,amazing art guys!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i have been posting this question many times on posts like these. ok, i get it, it's an ad. but wtf do you guys even want to see on this subreddit. i literally don't understand! you're not supposed to posts streams, you can't showcase your games, you can show screenshots or recording of gameplay, but how can you tell if its genuine or if they're shilling? which subreddit are you even supposed to post your upcoming games on of you're a gamedev? i agree, astroturfing should not be allowed on reddit. but i think these gamedevs resort to those tactics because of reddits stupid rules. do you guys even want to support indie devs? or do you guys only like playing the yearly installments of fifa? no body is forcing you to buy this, this was literally upvoted to the top by democratic voting. if you don't like it, don't buy it, or unsubscribe and go to rfifa or something. i know i sound a little obnoxious, but i really am genuine in the questions i asked. wtf do you guys want to see on this subreddit and where else on reddit should devs advertise upcoming games?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,have you heard marionettes 1 and 2 by enter shikari bc you should definitely think of cutting a trailer to those songs

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it looks beautiful. my first question upon watching is, 'does it have like qwop type controls? or are the mechanics more straightforward?' i'd be hesitant to buy if the mechanics are overly complicated. but aesthetically, i'm super interested."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,so im not a developer but this is this how long it typically takes to make it a game like this?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"good graphics good gameplay i say this is a very good game, keep it up!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,extremely awesome
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"honest, it may be a great game, but what little this clip shows, it seems quite generic. if you have a special angle with the marionettes, it might be good to show that off in your trailer as well, cause when i look at it, nothing really sticks out, aside for some lines reaching into the sky. based on your description and the trailer i don't even know what type of game it is. is it a platformer? a puzzle game? action? game may or may not be great, but you might need to work a bit on your trailers, cause this tells me absolutely nothing to help me decide if i want to spend any time to look into it. the trailer says we got pretty graphics, but that is about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i wouldnt play it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,fackkk looks great

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks interesting
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"there are so many games now that look like the most amazing works of art, but in terms of gameplay are just easy platformers with some sort of unique puzzle element which never holds my attention for long and i think its a shame because so much time and effort has been spent developing the game. i feel like i would probably be better off just having each of the levels as an animated wallpaper or something so i can properly appreciate all the art. but i guess maybe im just not the target audience lots of people clearly like playing games like this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looms great!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i think it looks amazing. i think about how i see so many videos like this of new incredible games that have been developed by a group of friends and no matter how hard i try i cannot find one person from all the people i know with any interest in developing a project animation, video game, graphic novels, graphic series. where are all the talented people with drive irl?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"at 14 seconds the illusion is shattered. it seems to me that the strings should pull to the right at the top of the screen, but the marionette should stop moving forward."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,the game is called a juggers tale. i know that its 18 usd on the nintendo eshop. if it wasn't so expensive for a new game i def would try it but i'm not gonna spend that money on a game who's previewed game play heavily resembles a game already on the market.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i saw the beginning of it years ago but forgot about it until this post. i may just have to look it up again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,the funniest part is the comment that finds the name of the game always gets tons of awards. blatant advertising.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,the next step is to realize 90 of the front page is boosted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,using bots to inflate the upvotes to get it to top along with comments that are paid for to make it seem genuine.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,and they have this aesthetic or something very similar.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,and the answer is always the same shouldn't have quit your day job.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,and why is it always some indy game and typically nothing else? like 60k people care of some random side scroller.. right
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"looks more like inside to me than limbo. then again, they're both made by the same studio."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"id say unravel more than anything, but still see limboinside as its a side scroller."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,"do you know the size of the studio? my friend and i are working on an indie game and we have an llc and listed as a studio even though its just the 2 of us. the hardest thing about making a game is marketing. to reach a large audience you either have to pay a lot of money, sell out to a publisher, or post on social media. this post doesnt hurt anyone and gives the chance of people to find the game. of course i may be biased as a developer but its annoying seeing people whine about ads. yeah sometimes ads suck but how else are you suppose to know that whatever product that is being advertised even exists? ads, as long as they arent misleading, arent evil. every product needs them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"324 awards and 84k points after 6 hours, one of the top comments with several awards is a paid comment saying the name and where to find it. we already know what this is lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,"it could be a really fun game akin to unraveled but they literally don't even show gameplay. they show a person walking... and walking.. and then walking some more. and the first time she encounters an obstacle that makes her strings relevant, they cut away and don't show her getting around it or using her strings in any way...."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,there is always an end user agreement
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,thank reddit for that. if they tell the name of the game it's labeled as advertisement and it gets removed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,advertising tactic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"also there's no actual gameplay shown. unless the game is 95 running to the right they need to include clips of what you actually do in the game and how the marrionette mechanic plays into the game. it could be a good, but it fails to show us it is."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"its not that they are the same but there are many indie games and as such the majority follows formulas that are either tried and true, easy to program, easy to profit off of, or all of them if they are lucky. so enjoy indie sidescroller 4035 with a quirky gimmick!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i'm wondering if the strings actually do anything or are just visual effects.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"hate to agree but damn its true. looks identical to a handful of other games. the marionette aspect is the only unique thing i see so far, but it could have more under the surface as far as gameplay goes"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,4 years to make a generic game? bruh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yes because every game has to invent a new genre or mechanic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,because of the strings! did you see the strings!?!?!?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i know theres plenty but i enjoy them lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,lol i love going into these obvious adverts and seeing comments like this calling it out. like go ahead and post your game but its annoying that its in the form of a disingenuous bought post.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i mean should he? if is social media game is good enough to get this upvoted on reddit, why should he pay for ad space instead?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"yep, they ask 13 bucks for this. i can have a good meal for that, a bundle of classic games, or just 1 classic game. buy a good movie or 3 with that, buy a bunch of cheap second hand games, go to the movies without the food. grab a bunch of cheap burgers from mcdonalds. cook a great meal with that for me and someone. grab a 24 carton of a soda water drink. buy a pack of underwear with socks. buy some christmass balls or lights, buy booze for the whole evening... the possibilities are endless and these guys think this game is worth it compared to those things. edit the game is 2 hours long. the dev said that on the steam forums. makes it even worse."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"but then its just a walking simulator. the strings make it original, obviously."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,looks dumb tbh.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,boom. roasted.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,so they can pretend its not an advertisement
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,so their totallynotanadvertisement ppst doesnt get flagged n removed. basically rgaming says you can advertise as long as you dont provide the name yourself.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,me and my friends all collectively laughed at how much you nitpick grammar

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,the fact that the marionette strings are physicsbased and can get caught on objects in the environment is what hooked me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yeah he has friends in high places.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,", if the game is good then i dont care, since i hate searching for games, its tedious and boring  its good to discover something like this"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yeah this game looks super like inside and limbo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,limbo was the first thing i thought of...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this is very much part of the tactic and it works to appear they did not intend to spam as they knew others would link to it. it's great marketing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,posting links and the name of your game will get you banned from most subreddits. the best you can do is hope that someone else does it for you. its even worse in some of the game development subs.. if you actually talk about your project youll get banned. its fucking weird.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"really? you do know this guy is op's friend just helping with the marketing, right? this is just how indies do advertising, it's fine, but it's a bit disingenuous when they tagteam a thread. just link your game op, it's fine."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it makes them seem far more humble and you are more likely to dig for the information, pushing your interest into the game more. it's quite standard tactics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"this is op. someone finding it is marketing, because it looks better than just op telling what the name is in the eye of the public."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i saw it on ps5!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"of course its an ad. they literally said this is our game, it releases in a hour."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,wow did you figure that one out all by yourself?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"yeah, fuck those indie devs for leveraging reddit to get eyes on their game! s"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,was anyone doubting that op is advertising their creation? no. who gives a fuck? no one except salty miserable people. they made something cool and they want to show it off and have it be successful. nothing wrong with that at all. it's not like it's a deceptive ea ad masquerading as a real human being.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"oh boy, nobody can fool you, can they!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,god damn a bunch of ignorant mofos think theyre really clever for calling you dumb when theyre missing that the comments are also the ad.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,in general it's not taboo to advertise indie games which have no marketing funnel or existing audience. very different if creator of limbo would make a post like this.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,200 bucks and you can have a top posthttpsyoutu.be6sakus3urrg
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,and aall is released on steam
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it looks super good though and the idea of quitting your job to develop your own game is a popular fantasy among gamers, so these posts will always gather a lot of sympathy. the opposite would be weird actually."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"the spider is very limbo but the rest is like inside, you can tell it was heavely inspired by those games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,came here to say im getting inside vibes!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i immediately thought of both games. great games, at that"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,jesus christ you would think the guy announced he created half life 3. what a joke. wonder how much they paid for this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this is literally an ad with paid comments.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i'll never judge an indie dev doing what he has to do to market their game their budgets are tiny, usually a passion project, and they have to put in a lot of their own income into the game. do what you have to do! big companies can create fake accounts to get engagement or advertise indiscriminately even on reddit which they don't care about. these guys gotta do posts like this. it's just the way of the game, do what you have to do to make your dream real they also make most of their money on that first day"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,good. i wish theyd remove this fucking trash. so tired of it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,unless the game is 95 running to the right this describes every i made an indie game and it releases soon post that gets 50k upvotes
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,it's a side scrolling game... so yeah it's 95 running to the right
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i bought one game because of a similar gimmick. top post on reddit, a bunch of extremely positive comments, was presented as if it was something completely underground and different. it was 5 on steam so i checked it out and literally it was the most bare bones tycoon game i've ever played. free mobile games had more to do, better mechanics and were honestly more fun. i gave it a pass cause i figured oh it's made by like one guy and maybe it'll get better and almost two years later it has had one minor content update and everything about the game is exactly the same. these posts are just shitty guerrilla marketing for shitty games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,' i quit my 6 figure job to follow my dream of making an indie game no one will play. hope you guys are looking forward to literally never hearing about it again!'
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it's just pity upvotes. you spent 2 years making a dimly lit, freecamera side scroller? that's....nice"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,it's been 6 hours and 90k upvotes yet the steam page only has 18 reviews across all languages lmao.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it looks like they'll stop you from going under certain platforms. a revolutionary spin on last year's game where you had to change characters to get over certain platforms. these programmers' genius literally know no bounds nvm, upon rewatching the gameplay, i realize that the strings rarely come into play"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,seems pretty similar to unravel
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,"wow, yall are super fuckin negative toward a person who made an actual video game huh?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"why go through all that effort, its obvious"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,wtf
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,did you miss the fact the strings stopped her from moving under something? they're clearly a mechanic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"well as you can see in the video, it adds a dynamic where the strings will get caught on things. im assuming youll have to figure out ways to get through rather than taking the obvious path."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"for 13 you can get like 12 games from humble bundle, and that goes to charity."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"spending 13 to go to the movie for two hours is a reasonable trade, but spending the same amount on a two hour video game is not? i get that this is an obvious shill posts, but the comments here are vitriolic and unreasonable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,yet you probably pay 60 every year for a fifa roster update...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"ooohh, how quirky! team america simulator"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yea i only saw this clip but i think it would be really fun to be able to use the strings similar to spiderman swinging and be able to ground slam off it similar to titan smash in destiny or wrecking ball in overwatch. no idea if this dude went that route but the game looks pretty and depending on price it might be worth it to try it for 10 minutes before shelving it on the rare chance it's worth a larger time investment.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"this account is with a 90 certainly a bot account, flagged as such, mods do the rest."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"fuck you dummy, you are not excited to play this. you're either op's alt or one of the dev friends. at least just admit it and stop trying to astroturf."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"you honestly can't be that excited. it's a sidescroller, the strings are literally the only difference from a large handful of games out there"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"ooh ps lovely, when is the game getting its release over there?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,a lot of these sorts of comments are bots to make the game seem more popular than it actually is. its just a shitty sidescrollling platformer
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what's it called?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,you mean like how little big planet did so horrible?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,their strings would get all tangled up!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,nice
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,for shame. you should never have dust on it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,"gotta say i immediately thought this is inside but with strings above. it looks like a lot of work has gone into the art, but yeah, its kind of an unavoidable comparison."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,because gamers are crying about the possibility that the op might've bought commentsupvotes to promote his game. edit a typo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i was wondering the same thing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,sweeeeet!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"yeah, thanks for correcting me. i changed it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"call me a shill if you want. this was not meant for you hyper defensive pessimists, it was for people who wanted to purchase the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,that would just be yourself. the strings that move you would be the unknown and known forces that drive us.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i'll be honest, when indie games showcase some novel and unique scenario even if it's gimmicky, so long as it's sufficiently unique, i don't see a problem, regardless of whether it's part of a paid guerilla marketing campaign, or something that arose organically, it is fine by me. why? because this post is substantially more entertaining than some reposted meme or gif i've seen intermittently over the last 6 months or longer. this is still original content. so even if it is a promo or whatever, i prefer it to the reposts made by bots and karma farmers."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,fun fact play dead studios makers of limbo and inside are currently working on another game they are very excited about. so am i!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i get tangled vibes too
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,same here plus the puppet mechanic is giving me unravel vibes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,this is precise though it came to my mind as well. and both of those games were fantastic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,came here to say this...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i prefer this kind of marketing for an indie game that at least looks unique to a bunch of reposted gifs and meme submitted by bots and karma farmers. it's sad when a literal advertisement is refreshing purely because it's oc.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,is it great? there's a content higher up than the actual answer where someone asks the title and his answer led me to believe the game is called abbey.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,guerilla marketing... you don't even need shills for it. users do the advertising for you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"usually they buy or use old accounts to do that for them. super common strategy. there are people in the comments asking what the game is called nut when you check their profile, 9 months ago there were advertising this exact same game for others. reddit's popular subreddits are nothing more than an ad machine at this point"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"yeah, with free reddit marketing you kinda just gotta keep it in the rules of subredditskeep it kinda vague. either way even exposing people to a trailer and getting some people talking about it is amazing relative to the nonexistent cost."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,look at this dudes post history. its literally just the ops alt. i wish theyd ban both and take this shit down. fuck ads
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it's actually considered selfadvertising and is bananable in most subreddits  edit i meant bannable, but bananable is just too funny to delete"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,fucking sherlock holmes up there figured it all out for us
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,reddit crucifies all content creators of any kind of they share their own content. hell even when you share other people's content you're not allowed to share the original source. god forbid you link to the creators youtube or instagram rather than reuploading to reddit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"it's the only social media platform that hates original content, and it's not better for it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,the only time i care is when they spam the shit out of it like that book dude last week. he spammed his pic in rpics like three days in a row among other subs  this guy actually participates in reddit besides just spamming his game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,nobody is allow to make something super cool on reddit. it makes people few insecure about their own accomplishments.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,how about u fuck off u absolute nerd
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,it's like truck simulator without the truck
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,it's like a double dutch rudder
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"well, i doubt the puppet consented so... it's probably better if we don't overanalyze this"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-02,"so i know im late to replying to this, but these style of games are called puzzleplatformers and theyre actually so much fun and pretty popular. look up little nightmares on youtube or twitch for the most popular example. or inside or limbo. little nightmares and inside as simple and dull as they seem at first glance are two of my alltime favorite games and they may look like nothing at first glance but they are actually pretty intense strategy games. its hard to explain how they work, you just have to either watch them or play them."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,i like how you referred to the game as she and the dev told you the characters name and you just went with it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i know youre just posting this for visibility for others who dont know the name, but im finding it hilarious that youre telling op the name of their own game lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,i've been noticing most comments that name the game are not op. peoples want titles first! gob cmon!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,what do you mean by paid comments?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"but even with those there are some type of gameplay involved, there's nothing shown here."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"this game doesn't happen to be a science based 100 dragon mmorpg, does it?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,but this one has parallax scrolling! like all the others
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,nah. not pity. paid for.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,no no it was op and their friends. it sounds nice having friends. have an upvote op forhaving friends.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,"sorry it just looks like a shameless rip off and if you read some other comments, its pretty much been established that there are a ton of fake accounts leaving generic positive comments and reviews. its pretty much a paid advertisment. that and the cookie cutter design doesn't make this look like anything other than a cash grab. although i blatantly said that maybe there is more than meets the eye which i believe is more credit than it deserves"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,damn he did you disgustingly dirty
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yeah anytime i see someone posting about their own game andor how they quit their job to develop it full time it's always very obvious. it'll always be like 24 hour posts with 10s of thousands of upvotes and a ton of awards lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"like every other ad, they want money ? edit thanks for editing your last comment after i replied, how's it feel ? to future readers my original comment above this that is currently about a research thing i completely made up was me pointing out how you could search for the word wow and look at how old all the accounts are providing praise to this game, supporting the idea that this post is an ad. redheadmomster then said why go through all that effort, to which i said like every other ad, they want money ? redheadmomster then edited their post to add the it's obvious bit on the end, which made my comment look dumb, so i had some fun with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i guess you're right, and there's a point where she loses the strings entirely. but it doesn't clearly make or break the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i get your point, video games are far and away the best timeforvalue entertainment product around, but c'mon... the simple fact is this if you want to get people to throw money at your unknown game the market is competitive and unless you're offering an obvious breakthrough 13 for 2 hours is a risky thing to ask. your competition is the rest of the games market where there are a large number of other titles with better value proposition."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,why is this downvoted? that person's last comment is a month ago in a thread praising this exact same game. these comments are fake as fuck

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"yeah, this is honestly better than reposted memes. do i need another remember, no preorders meme?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"i'm fine with paid promos, what i hate about these ads is that they do everything they can to make it look organic. buy tens of thousands of upvotes, thousand of comments. only reply to the comments they literally wrote themselves, complimenting their own game. it's just so blatantly fake, yet they never admit to it. also  if you look at the video clips in these posts, it's never of actual gameplay. because they know if they posted the actual gsmeplay it would likely look like shit compared to this."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,it is great because the post hasn't been deleted. if they put the title in it could be removed as advertising which it obviously is anyways. but now it's just a gif of a game they worked on and someone else was so interested they happened to post the title!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,they asked what she is called not the game. the character's name is abbey.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"they dropped a hint at how to find the game. this will increase searches and move their game to the top of the organic results in google. this is helping improve their seo. i assure you, none of that is by accident. not that im at all bothered by it. i wish them all the success."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,then your an idiot because its specifically said thats the protagonists name

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,the only time i really dont like to see people promoting their own work is when its on a sub like rbeamazed or rnextfuckinglevel this seems totally fine and looks like an awesome game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,then in threads where old content thats acceptable is posted people complain that no one develops new content and posts it. reddit truly is a wonder to behold.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"share their own content. add for profit. in my travels people love it when users share things they make if they're not asking you to give them something, typically money. locationcontext is also important. i expect to be advertised to in rgames, but not in rgamedev. it's also why we have rableton, a sub dedicated to the use of software to make music, and rmadewithableton, a sub dedicated to show off anything you made with effectively no strings attached. depends on the sub's culture."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"yea except a lot of the accounts leaving positive comments here are very new. it's the fact that reddit andor op are disguising this ad as a popular organic post, and fooling plenty of people that would otherwise never want anything to do with an ad to interact with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"agreed. that guy also had a stake in the publisher as well. ads like this post are fine imo, in moderation, but what that guy was doing to rpics was a bit too much."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,why go through all the effort to prove its an ad. its obvious
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,you're right also both op and this account are active in the heroesofthestorm subreddit and are both german.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,yep. that has to be the most obvious shill here.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,they are a bot. neifary is fake account made to promote the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,for a game with 4 years work literally nothing is highlighted. honestly what's at all is too look forward to in this game as it stands?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"also, like i said... i've played plenty of sidescrollers with darksurreal undertones. enough to be completely bored by this already"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,no thankyou. honestly looks quite boring. this post in general smells of friends pushing it forward. plus some string physics are definitely not enough to make me purchase this

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,okay i mean objecting to ads masquerading as organic content isnt on quite the same level as criticizing things just to be contrarian. not that i mind this one it looks pretty cool and op seems to be a real human but it would be a mess if every game did this shit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-30,"looking at the live stream on the steam page of this game, this is actual gameplay though..."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"bingo. if op wants to advertise, pay for it like every other forprofit company and get a nice promoted tag next to their post. it's the same exposure, only transparent. sure, less people will see it, but that's because some people don't like being hawked to when they're here for community conversation."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-09-29,"true, but in my experience, if they don't show you gameplay then it's gonna be pretty meh. and if you go and watch the unravel trailer on steam, it still shows more than this. here, there are literally 2 maybe 3 if you count the reset game mechanics visible. unravel clearly shows more game mechanics in action, and is much more animated and in motion, despite both being side scrollers. it's a subtle difference, but still important for making the game look much more like an actual game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-09-09,"i think the poster's line of thought is that you have an oddly high need for social contact, because developing a feeling of loneliness doesn't normally happen in just a day  which is what your phrasing implied. however, different people will have different tolerances for the absence of social contact, and the reddit demographic will probably be skewed in the other direction from you anyway, meaning they are slightly odd as well and thus see you as odder than normal. edit i lazily missed out temporal issues like an absent partnercancellation of social plansetc., which also makes being lonely in a day make sense for anyone. also and probably more importantly i think there's an interaction between you being attractive and saying you are lonely. the only place you normally see titles with i was lonely today so... is rgonewild, afaik. so there might be a kneejerk reaction to see your phrasing as being vainselfabsorbedattention seeking."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,have you seen what happens when reddit visits a page?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,"what do you mean, 'you people'?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"thanks for the full resolution. my first thought when i saw this picture was man, i wish this was bigger..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,i would have understood it from your description but the 2 confused me since i had just looked up that minus world stuff.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,you rang?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,"the appeal is that it would be a nice, juxtapositional change of pace in a few hidden levels, but probably not as an entire game, for instance."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,it reminds me of thousand year door when mario gets his body stolen it was surprisingly cool to be playing mario with that kind of tone.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,you obviously did not play limbo...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"it doesn't have to be the same exact game in monotone, the gameplay could be changed to fit the style. it would be challenging to have lakitus able to spring sneak attacks on you from clouds, and i'm sure nintendo would come up with all sorts of other kooky shit to throw in there, like how they didn't make mario galaxy exactly like smb3 in space. new environment, new game, and it did well. besides, we all know what everything in a mario game looks like, i'm sure most of us would be able to accurately fill in a mario world coloring book from memory by now. as it stands, all the mario platformers look the same by now, with their sleek, pixelless, nextgen models that look like they just came out of a 3d printer. just less aliasing and better shading with every new system that comes out. change is good. let's have a grittier mario. maybe even a really gritty mrated mario, where he takes some bad mushrooms and wakes up in an alley somewhere, except now everything looks like grand theft auto v, but with hallucinations of nasty, realisticallytextured koopa troopas and goombas creeping out from behind every object, and the first thing mario does is grab an smg with fire flower, inc engraved on the side from a trash can and say let'sa go before the opening credits roll to a heavy metal intro. yeah i know that'd never happen, but i'd play the shit out of that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,maybe it would add an ending.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"obviously a mario game would not be done entirely in this style. it would be interesting to see this done for certain levels, such as underground warp tube levels. or to design a game that had you switching back and forth between lightdark with a power mario has for example, a bowsercorrupted dimension and normal mushroom kingdom, just a daynight cycle, or as part of a luigi's mansion game spirit worldreal world. it would be pretty cool to have dark colorless levels like this to contrast the bright colors in the rest of the game. it would also do a good job conveying a more sinister tone if used appropriately with the plot."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"that, and whenever you even touch an enemy you would dieexplode in a gruesome display of blacked out gore and guts. ...poor kid from limbo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,like a nightmare world for mario. maybe after luigi dies saving peach and peach is too guilty and has gone missing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,if it had the same graphicsphysics style engine as limbo then thats even better.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"you'd have to make it deeper than that. add new mechanics to the game. perhaps expand on the whole falling behind the foreground technique they had in mb3 similar to how rotation was added in paper mario. make it darker. make enemies more aggressive and puzzleesque. kill off peach and have it send mario into a vengeful rampage terms of enrampagement kind of rampage while making him a jaded aged hero in the midst of it all. you could add a lot of depth and fun to it. it would be a bastardized version yes, but i think things existing in an alternate universe like this allows for super creative fun shit to go down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"it is fantastic. better than the original 3, except for 2, in my opinion"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"both are awesome game. i prefer braid though, it has a more happy style."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,it has a similar feel but a completely different game. if you liked limbo you will honestly love this game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,i would say i liked it a bit better than limbo. but it's a lot harder.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"okay, you're right. i didn't get the feels part of the picture at first."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,not even to mention you can expand that annoyingly simplistic train of thought to literally anything. i don't see why mario is so popular. you just run around mashing jump all day.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,that sounds right. can you describe it more?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"mario 2 when you go into the doorsdown tubes and vases with a mushroompotion being used, it turns into this shadowed world. similar effect to posted image."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,new super mario world... eww..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"the game's 8 years old and he spoiled nothing, dude."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,are you suggesting reddit will break deviantart? haha.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,what page... it's always gone when i get there...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"what do you mean, what do you mean, 'you people'??"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,fair enough. i actually would like them to bring back 1 world in a modern mario game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"your name was stolen? i see i guess that happens from time to time  wait, no it doesnt!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,mario is nothing like limbo. does anyone here know what i'm talking about? i never said the visual style aint good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"i wouldn't take it quite that far, but a more cautious horror mario would be cool, like you said sneaky lakitus, huge fearsome piranha plants, and fuckme level designs."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"agreed. i loved how it was done in donkey kong country returns. granted it was just cosmetic, i loved the feel of those stages. see httpi.imgur.comkzag8.jpg edit granted dkcr has a warmer feel, its still in line with the silhouette theme"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"i am forthright regarding my preference.httpwww.reddit.comrsnescommentsykuigdonkeykongcountry2diddyskongquestmyc5whwis dkcr is my favorite platform game since lost levels, and probably the best game for wii. i say this as someone playing through a hard drive full of wii games. you will flip the bird at your wii many, many times."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,"i've never been to it personally, but i've read about it. it comes up as world 1. there are different ones on nes and famicom. iirc, the famicom minus world is at night with all sorts of trippy shit in it, like neon colors, the princess as a floor texture etc... basically the twilight zone of the mario universe. not sure about the nes one, but supposedly you can't get out of it. the only way to complete the world is to die and lose all of your lives."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"do you know about the warp pipes on 12? well if you croutch jump against that last wall you can reach the pipes before the numbers appear over them, causing the game to load a random file and take you to world ' ', without any proper programming the level is endless"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"i know, it's terrible, but i really want another experience like that game. it's the only game i can play over and over and never get tired of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,his name. i was mostly joking.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,"yeah perhaps not. but to be fair to op, he did link to deviant in the comments at the same time he post the link."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,1 world?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,there was something beautiful about the way the cutesy comedy was kept in with such an eerie setting.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"i apologize, i never considered that"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,mario game with manhunt style gameplay. same frilly princess and lakitu but you've got to sneak around and the enemies are just as sneaky. i'd play that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"oh yeah, i still think the more realistic limbo idea is worth some corporate attention for sure. there is the potential to mature that franchise but i bet nintendo is a bit nervous about doing that to the one thing that most represents their entire company. they shouldn't be, though, i'd buy epic mario one day and finish up a couple levels of a new yoshi's island the next. i don't care much when it comes to video game continuity as long as the games are good, and neither do most people i know."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,i hate you
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"the music was fantastic on this level. dkcr was just so damn hard, i still haven't finished it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,"the nes one just takes you to a water level. reaching the end just sends you back to the beginning of the level. also, if you lose a life, you restart directly above a whirlpool."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-27,"slightly unrelated, but comment chain reminds me of candle cove httpwww.ichorfalls.com20090315candlecove"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,i actually like the nsmb games but im watching reviews and stuff for nsmb2 and it doesnt look that great...the one coming out for wii u looks awesome though...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"ha, recursion!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,it was a glitch in super mario bros. here's a link to it httpwww.mariowiki.comminusworld
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,"there it is, thanks for clearin up. i may have to finally try that out. back in the day i didn't have the internet to tell me about a minus world. it's intriguing even more now, creepy even."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,dude i loved that show!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-28,heheh it's a tad creepy. was candle cove sort of like a 70's are you afraid of the dark?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,even as a younger gamer i karma farm the same as everyone else
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,im not sure street fighter 2 was one of the best examples here
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,complete game still exist today. x200b you are just buying the wrong games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"dlc was retitled because you could just download it. we used to call them expansions. expansions  dlc came about as a way for the game maker to try and keep players engaged with their game for longer, improve or expand their stories  and obviously enhance their bank accounts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,rlewronggeneration
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"back then you had to buy street fighter 2 like 5 times to get the whole game, so not the best example"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"except sonic the hedgehog 3, that was clearly half a game with the other half being sonic and knuckles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yaaaa this post again let's gooooooo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"maybe buy complete games? another one of those shitty old games good, new games bad crap post. you know what you also had in the old days? barely a few hours long games. no support for it after release. many shitty games that was way harder to learn about befor purchase. stuff like that that people like to forget. don't get me wrong, i loved gaming 20 years ago but i still do today. just stop prerordering, wait for sales, wait for patches, wait for complete editions if you want."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"whole game was a whole lot less back then tho. i grew up with many of these old games they were great but like sonic i can finish in a day edit they deleted their comment but someone alluded that was just sega but man same with nintendo games. you can do most old mario games and metroid in a day or two if you know what your doing. old games made up for limited space by making themselves harder so youd get more play out of them, cause they did not have large amounts of actual content."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,removed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"so many shitty games back in that era. inflated, bullshit difficulty so you'd have to keep feeding quartersrenting the game out. box art that had literally nothing to do with gameplay. games also had a fraction of the content they often do these days, so a whole game back then probably wouldn't pass as a half a game these days. and the best part is without the internet it was damn near impossible to tell the good games from the shitty ones until you had already paid for them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"back then a complete game was very light on content  and to compensate that it was really difficult and often times you had to figure very basic stuff out because it was overly complicated. and today? most games are complete! sure there is dlc, it most of it is completely unnecessary. and sure there are patches and some games are not in the best state when released  but then again games get supported for a very long time. this nostalgic back then everything was better is really missing a lot of reality. i was a gamer in the days of nes and i am still a gamer today. every time had its advantages but i am really glad we are where we are today!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,remember when the industry nearly collapsed due to terrible games being released and the nes had to practically save the industry? probably not with shite posts like this

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"say what you will about old games  are many people complaining about old games? also, as has already been said, these are not good examples."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,complete like sf2 or sf2 championship edition or sf2 turbo or super sf2 or super sf2 turbo?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,how many versions of street fighter 2 did we have to buy before they finally settled on a complete roster? did they ever settle on a complete roster for 2?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"xenogears is still one of my favorite games of all time, but that thing was 23 finished and they released it anyway"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"my man really put street fighter 2 here, even when capcom sell like a million versions with bare minimum changes betwen eachother, and sonic 3 is by many people consider to be the first game to have a dlc bc of sonic and knuckes was an addon for the game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"rofl. not this shit again. no game is ever complete. every game can be expanded upon, tweaked, improved, bugfixed, etc. your cognitive dissonance comes form the fact that video game developers couldn't easily do these things once a game shipped, especially before the internet came around. and speaking of bugs.... every. single. console. game. ever. has bugs. all of them. don't believe me? google insert favorite game known bugs so, isn't it nice that we live in a day and age where developers can continually improve the games we play? well, that's a question for a different debate because there are pro's and con's to this as well... namely things like microtransactions, nfts and paytowin. but this idea that you bought a whole game, back in the day, is severely flawed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"first, this is stupid because it's cherry picked of the best games of that time. tons of games were glitchy messes. people also seem to forget how short games were. no wonder they were complete. it's why old gamers loved blockbuster or other rental programs. almost every game was beatable within the 2 or 3 days for the rental even for a kid. just look at speed runners being able to beat these games in under 15 minutes consistently. and we didn't save money. games were more expensive then they are now. i care about how much it costs to entertain me. today it's the best bang for your buck. games are cheaper before you include competing retailers and physical vs digital to bring price down. plus games are generally longer for single player games and multiplayer adds hours and hours of repeat gameplay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this has to be satire
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,new game bad
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"true, but when the whole game is about 5 megabytes large that's a little easier to do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you only think you got the entire game because patches werent possible yet. you got what you got, that doesnt mean the game was finished. wow, people are so dense."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,games nowadays are so much bigger. an unfinished cyberpunk game at launch is still a bigger game than all 4 of those games combined
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this is the dumbest thing ever. there are so many incredible games out there these days. sometimes you just have to do a bit more research or wait for game reviews so you dont buy broken games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,reddit moment
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,untrue. most of these old games were so hard you couldn't finish them. let alone knowing where to go or what to do in link to the past or any other rpg prior to the internet.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"whatever, dude. i grew up in that era and, sure, lots of games were complete when you purchased them. but the incomplete games that come out today have about 50 hours more of content. for the same, or less, price."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you really putting street fighter 2 on there? the game with multiple rereleases that are basically full priced expansions?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"eh, this is basically just karma farming. games still shipped broken but they never got fixed. they still shipped incomplete, but you never knew it because they released sequels instead of dlc. publishers are greedy today, they were greedy under reagan too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this is some boomer shit for millennials. i dont have to remind you about sonic 3 and knuckles.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yes, but no.  if there were any bugs in the release, you were stuck with them while newer versions were made and sold.  many sequels and specialcollector editions of games were just what would be dlc today many of them would just be free updates. super mario bros the lost levels smb2 in japan would surely have been handled as dlc today, as would the third version of any pokmon game except, maybe, yellow.  if you wanted the definitive edition of the game, you had to wait until the end of its lifecycle to get it, sell your original to buy the new one, or buy both. that being said, though, there are a ton of shitty practices today like locking away content that is already included in the base game or making the game unnecessarily grindy in order to encourage people to pay for exp boosts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"when i bought the super metroid cartridge that was it. the whole story was in that cartridge. samus, come back please. show them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you can still do this. just wait 12 months after the game comes out. its 20 bucks with all the content.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i remember the days when madden games weren't buggy, and were fun to play. knowing that the games can be fixed with online patches and micro transaction ruined the experience of buying a new game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"now this is some grade a rosetinted glasses nonsense. back in the day, video games were routinely published with missing content that could make them impossible to complete, content was cut from them to reduce the size of the game which would make areas of the game sparse with content or completely empty, and there were tons of bugs that simply would never be fixed because there was no way to distribute patches. here's an insane horror story from the mid90s there was a demo for a video game where they fucked up the uninstall process, so that if you wanted to uninstall the demo, it would literally delete the entire folder that the game folder was in. the default install path for video games back then was cprogram files. yup. i thankfully made a separate games folder, but it obviously deleted all the games i had installed. i could just reinstall those, even though i lost the save games, but some people lost important documents, software that they couldn't easily get back, and many had to reinstall windows to fix all the issues this created."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what a garbage ass post. you don't resonate with anything other than karma.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"ya, i hate when they add to the games i love. it's like why would you keep adding to a game after it feels finished? everyone knows the witcher dlcs were just the worst."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"you only resonate with it because youre a younger gamer who didnt actually live through these release years. you get to look back at the best of these generations, because most of the crap isnt brought up anymore."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,shut the hell up
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,holy fuck the karma farm continues.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,sonic 3 wasnt a full game lmao
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,it is so tempting to leave this sub rn
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this post has boomer energy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"street fighter 2 is kind of a weird example for this picture, when we got several rereleases and new editions of it that all added new content but kept the core game the same."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,37 year old gamer. this isnt true at all. a lot of games came brokenglitchy and quality was all over the place. dont let nostalgia from people make you think games used to be better than they are now. i still wish xenogears could have had dlc. also games are much less expensive compared to some nes games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,et has entered the chat.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ljn has entered the chat. atleast with updates they have the ability to fix a shitty broken game. doesnt mean they will but they have the choice to. back then when you were getting one game per report card you were stuck with it and you learned to love even the worst games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"shows street fighter 2, a game notorious for having a million updates that were packaged as full new games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,say what you will as if there is any historical context for people badmouthing older games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,rgaming try not to repost the same 5 images everyday challenge impossible
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"as a 25 year old who's played just about every console and spent thousands on video games over the years, grow the fuck up. you can still play all those old games and there's still plenty of full games whatever the fuck that means that don't require you to spend money. the gaming community has gotta be the whiniest and most pandered to demographic of people i've ever experienced."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah you didnt own a nintendo then. some of the games they put out were actually unfinished messes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"street fighter for example. the snes version originally came with 8 characters, thats it. the newest street fighter as a base already came with more than that. so all they do is offer more characters with more money. i bet many people would love to pay extra to get the 4 heavenly king as playable characters back in the days if the option is there. yes you dont have dlc and such back then, but it is due to technological limitation and not by choice."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,who are these people?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"but game prices have stayed at 60 for decades. games would be like 100 or more if they rose with inflation since the 80s. i dont mind dlc because games today have so much more content than any game i played back then. as long as the base game is good and the dlc is just makes it better i'm fine with that, development is expensive."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i remember being blown away by super mario bros. 3 the first time i finished the world 1 map...wait, there's seven more worlds? i thought that was the whole game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,got the whole damn game after how many iterations of street fighter 2 did we get the whole damn game?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i don't know man. compared to what? just last years re8 is longer and with more production value than re1. one could say it's even more complete. cut content? i'mma be real with you, when you were a kid who didn't keep up with game development and it was harder to do because the internet wasn't what it is today you just didn't notice it. almost any popular game from any period of time suffered from cut content. there were a better sortment of quality games? bullshit, you remember the good games, not the bad ones which there were plenty of back in the day. old man nostalgia bait. people not even realising they are becoming their grandparents bitching about the good old days. yeah grandpa wow an hour long game with instant deaths and complete restarts after your tiny pool of life is gone to artificially lengthen the experience really sounds amazing. such a complete experience grandpa."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ok but like my whole friend group loves finding the bugs in games because their funny and make gaming what it is. y'all just have too high of standards
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"not really. dlc was just packaged as a new game, hello street fighter 2 champion edition, street fighter 2 turbo edition"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"do yall really not understand how complicated expensive video games have gotten? you act like maintaining street fighter 1 and maintaining halo infinite are the same thing .i get that its gotten pricier but so has everything else and no one is forcing you to buy extra things . but dont buy a game with a campaign , multiplayer, custom games ,etc and then get mad when they make add ons and expect you to pay them for their hard work"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i think street fighter ii is the skyrim of its generation
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this isnt always true either
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you can't compare these tiny games with little code to today's games. also, if a game was released with a bug you were just fucked. i'll take patches any day of the week over that. if we're talking about dlcs and micros then yeah fuck that shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i mean, you don't have to look that far back to find full and complete games. and isn't there like 25 versions of sf2?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i kinda love fighting game dlc it ensures that the player base surges again every 2 months or so just to see what the new character is like and sometimes people like the character so much that it reinvigorates the game for them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah. and when you bought a game, it was put together by like 12 people, rather than being a strong parallel to a hollywood production."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,is this an unintentional shit post
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this sub is so bad
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"they even put sonic in the picture, but the  knuckles expansion started the meme about the sega tower. street fighter 2 has like 12 different versions all with slight changes, and mario's lost levels could only be found in the allstars pack here in america. addons didn't start with dlc, and they won't end with microtransactions and gamesasaservice models. but at the same time, i'm not gonna try to yuck someone's yum. these games are all great, just maybe not for the exact reason given."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah, someone forgot about street fighter 2, street fighter 2 turbo, street fighter 2 champion edition, street fighter 2', super street fighter 2, super street fighter 2 turbo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i mean yeah but those games also never got patches and provided you with a couple hours of content before they got repetitive. personally i'll take a game that continually comes out with updates over a game that's left to rot after it's released.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you say that having a picture of sonic and street fighter. the first of which made you get an expansion to play the second half of sonic 3 and the latter made you buy 20 versions of street fighter 2. it was always an issue , it just got worse and way easier to do it"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,so glad my dad introduced me to the games he played as a kid. me and him beat contra the other day on the nes. he said that was the first time he beat the game. i felt so happy to have shared a moment like that with him.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,the whole game was about 10 minutes long though and difficulty was the only thing making them last longer than that. things. are. better. now.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ah yes back when games were 3 megabytes and made by 9 people. now games are hundreds of gigabytes and made by thousands of people. with the same deadlines and prices as games made 10 years ago. im not saying that price locking games is ok i think its stupid but the gamingsphere is so different now its not comparable
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"first of all, this is karma farming with a repost that i've already seen a couple of times before with hypocrisy written on street fighter. second, this is the reason why preordering is not a good practice for either customer or developer, and you should always look at reviews to check if the game is complete and working with minimal bugs."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,street fighter 2 had 5 revisions that all cost 60 bucks each which could've been dlc. sonic 3 had an actual expansion pack in sonic and knuckles to get the full experience.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"that's not 100 true. deadlines and limited funds were still a thing back in the day, it's just that back then you couldn't really fix anything post launch so all the bugs, glitches, and unfinished games would remain in that state regardless of how easy the issues were to fix."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i buy complete games all the time, and no not indies. sounds like the problem is you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'd love to see these redditors in charge of a modern game company and see how they flop and sink an entire company. these cringe memes always leave out the part where modern video games are 20x more complex and expensive to make. and gamers demand the best graphics, perfect polish, and timely release or the studio will be meme'd and shamed. considering they have to do crunch time as it is and you still buy the game anyways, apparently they are still not working hard enough. i'm not excusing completely broken and buggy unplayable games. we have examples of those. but to expect some complex open world games that are 100x more complex than sonic the hedgehog, that require 100200 people to make at least and not 1220 like the old days, to provide everything free for you is absurd. where were you complaining when witcher 3 had paid dlc?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,me who play the pirated version hmmm
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,sonic 3 wasn't a whole game

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"and you got a lot less out of it and it still cost just as much, if not more. like, i hate the monetization fetish that a lot of developers have nowadays too, but games are much more expensive to make now, yet their cost is still around the same. plenty of games nowadays are a much higher value than anything from the 80's and 90's even before additional content."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,ever heard of shareware?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,well servers cost money so you couldnt play the game for more then a few months if it was done the old way so maybe stop complaining.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,it seems like weve forgotten about the 32x attachment for the sega megadrive.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"ive seen this meme before, and its bullshit. street fighter 2, street fighter 2 turbo, super street fighter 2, etc and you were paying full price for what amounted to an expansion pack, i.e. 80 for an snes game back then."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"at least when we bought them we got the whole game older games, fighting games especially, got balance updates all the time... in the form of full price rereleases."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"funny street fighter is there considering they bought out what? 3 console versions on the super nintendo at least? og version didn't have bosses as playable, they weren't added until street fighter ii turbo  and then they bought out the super street fighter ii edition that added fei long, cammy, dee jay and t.hawk lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"games are so much higher quality on average nowadays, people only think of the classics without acknowledging modern classics. balan wonderworld is memed on as an exceptionally poorly executed and pretty objectively bad game, but that quality was pretty much the norm until like the ps2 generation. there were a shit load of super buggy and poorly optimized games back in the day that you would have gladly taken a day 1 patch for."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"sonic 2 was beaten in 3 hours. it cost 60. oh, so good."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,they purposely made games harder back then so kids would rent them more. so many games back then we're absolute garbage. we are so spoiled with amazing games now that people complain about any little bug or inconvenience. the entitled gamer era of gaming is doing more damage to the industry than any greedy ceos
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"or you bought what you thought the game would be and got scammed, heh i guess it hasn't changed much"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this is such a flawed argument for so many reasons. mainly you just got the game, no possible way of expansion. absolutely skyrim, mass effect, or fallout could come out and not have any dlcs and it would absolutely feel complete, removing the option to expand into that world further is not the same as not complete. absolutely there are games that put key parts of it behind dlc, but nothing stops it from being a whole game. are you telling me that if super mario bros 3 had additional content that you could buy that had more levels that wouldn't be a good thing? also, you are forgetting how incredibly basic games were back then, so when you open a game to a large 3d world you offer more room for additional content to fill that world. it amazes me that these games that were 128 kb back then felt so complete when really they were pretty bare."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"think about the length of games back then versus now. most full priced games could be completed in a casual weekend, if not an afternoon. if a developer tried to release a full priced game nowadays that could be finished in under 8 hours, they would be absolutely crucified. also, while it's a problem that developers release buggy, unfinished games and use paying customers as unwitting beta testers, i think it's a worthwhile tradeoff for the ability to fix broken games post release"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"and all the bugsglitchessoftlocks that came with them. so, yes, we've given up whole games at launch, for quite a few games, but we have the ability to have games be fixed and perfected, or have even more content added beyond the original. x200b for games that do it well blasphemous, risk of rain 2, hades, dead cells, ender lilies, the binding of isaac rebirthafterbirthrepentance, rogue legacy 2, teardown, and powerwash simulator. yes, it's all indies, but that's because indies are on my brain"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you could also beat those games in one sitting. now people want 100 hour experiences
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i cant tell you how many weekends were ruined by old unplayable garbage games we rented during my childhood. there was plenty of unfinished garbage games back in the day. should we rented street fighter 2 again or risk it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this is always such a stupid point. all the things you think of as dlc? that make a modern game incomplete? they simply didnt exist with these games. its not that they came with content thats being charged for today, its that that content didnt exist."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ok boomer
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i see nobody complaining about old games...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,im sick of this sentiment. contemporary games are exponentially more complicated to make in every category. the same ppl saying this are also the ones who are complaining about games taking forever to develop. this dead horse has been beaten enough.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what's street fighter 2 doing in that image?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what a karma farm
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,the whole game took a few months to make. the whole street fighter 2 game had 5 versions released in 23 years. the whole game was a whole game because it was impossible to update. when are these nostalgic shit posts from people who know nothing about game development going to stop? hopefully eventually.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this is so low effort. go cry into your 15 minutes games. im sure star tropics sounds lovely this time of year
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"fuck. this. meme. street fighter 2 had, what, thirty different versions, each with slightly more content than the last? not to mention the fact that you literally had to pay every time you played it. and sonic 3 is explicitly an unfinished game, so much so that they released the second half of it as an attachment to the cartridge. anyone who posts this meme unironically is an idiot."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"complete games still exists  you just got look for them now, instead of it being the norm."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,sonic had a dlc called sonic and knuckles that was a separate cartridge you stacked the original game on top of to unlock the knuckles content in the original games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"now now, let's nor forget the video game crash of the 80s that lead to the death of the console market for some time. caused by a myriad of crappy, unfinished games that kept being pumped out. nor should we forger the games we've forgotten over the years because they weren't very good. the entire old game vs new game dichotomy is very dumb. we have amazing games these days, and we have awful ones, just like we had in the 90s. even older games that have stood the test of time can still have some miserable issues. i've been replaying knights of the old republic, and dear god the walking. the endless walking back and forth."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,in this example sf2 had so many variations with various balance tweaks and that sonic game required you buy another game to play the cart into. old games had revisions all the time. so quit your bullshit.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i'd say if people bought something with as much content as sf2 today they'd complain that game wasn't full enough.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,street fighter 2 is a terrible example. they kept rereleasing that game with more content every time.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"say what you will about new games. but at least when you buy a modern game, its not brutally difficult, saves your progress, isnt so short it can be completed in one sitting and isnt limited to a platformer or fighting game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you also got games that were broken and couldnt be fixed, no additional content if you loved a game. fighting games can have balance changes. new cars for racing games. new additional stories to play through. the base game is almost always a complete game. dlc is optional and is extra work for the devs."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,playing modern games is a full time job needing considerable investment in time and resources.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah, but you could beat those games in maybe two hours of play or less. there wasn't much to those complete games compared to what you get today in general, and generally speaking you actually do get a complete game unless you're buying early access or something even today. a lot of games that updated to add content just released an entirely new edition you had to buy, you couldn't get the new stuff ala carte like you can now in general. the idea of an incomplete game in regard to being a partial game is mostly a myth. sure, update patches for games pushed out before they are done are a thing these days, but you're not buying the rest of a game in those cases. you don't buy patches that finish a game, they are free. the fact that games are released unfinished is mostly a completely separate thing from dlcexpansions. dlc that isn't microtransactions is generally what we used to call expansions, and it worked pretty much exactly the same way, except you had to buy a physical copy and install it rather than it being a download. we also didn't generally get more in those expansions than we do in the average dlc today. yeah, you had those great diablo 2 dlcs with lots of content, but you've also got stuff like witcher 3's blood and wine or hearts of stone, or borderlands assault on dragon keep. there were just as many cheap garbage level pack disks that didn't add much to a game back then as there are cheap dlcs with mediocre content today. you just weren't aware of it if you were playing on a console for the most part. the only real difference is the delivery method. you just download it instead of getting a physical copy. the actual quality and volume of content has always varied from game to game. being incomplete is not the norm even for games with microtransactions. most microtransactions are either cosmetic or time savers that let you bypass parts of a game. i'm not condoning the practice, just stating what it generally actually is. the biggest exception to all this would be sports games where you have to rng for players in a store, which is also bad, but not really representative of most games these days. the sentiment of op's image is actually mostly based on myth, games were not more feature complete back then. they were smaller, had less content in general, and large amounts of unlocks were generally even rarer back then as they are now, and almost definitely fewer in number when they were there. you do generally get a whole game when you buy one these days. 99 of the time, expansions are content that would not have been included in an initial release even if the mode of delivery was the same as back then. dlc just gave consoles the ability to do expansion content like pc has been doing since the 80s. it pretty much works exactly the same way it always has. if anything it's less egregious that you don't have to buy a new edition of sf because super turbo championship edition released. though, they'll still gladly sell you multiple editions of pokemon if you want to catch 'em all. seriously, nothing has really changed for the most part except that you're more likely to be able to get something ala carte rather than buying a completely new edition, and it's generally not a physical thing you have to buy anymore. it's mostly just rose colored glasses seeing a bullshit idyllic past that never really existed. unless you're an ea sports fan, because it ain't in the game anymore, but they're mostly an outlier these days and don't really represent the model of most games with digital content."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,shit this is something that went the way of the dodo. i remember going to gamestop and buying a copy of gta san andreas back in the early 2000s and it was complete. i go to gamestop today and i buy a copy of literally anything and there's so much missing from the game that i have to pay for it's not even funny.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm not even that upset about dlc that adds story content. expansion packs were a thing back in the day. i wish they wouldn't salamislice the content the way they do y'all remember when expansion packs were practically a full game unto themselves?, but at least it makes it easier grab the good stuff and ignore the bad. but selling cosmetics, graphical overhauls, extra fucking skill trees, and save slots is bullshit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this is basically the reason why ive moved almost entirely to single player rpgs like divinity and prey. it may not be as fun to play by myself but at least then i know itll have enough content for a single person to enjoy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the only reason you got the 'whole game' back then is because they couldn't attach the stuff they cut out into the same game, so they just made a new game and sold you that instead. they chopped a whole bunch out of sonic 2 and put it in sonic 3, because they wanted to pop sonic 2 out in under a year to hit the 1992 holiday season, and then sonic 3 was split in half again to make sonic 3 and knuckles. so they made three technically 'full' games , released across 3 years. is that really better than if they'd have finished that content and added it as an expansion to the previous game?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,games were much shorter back then
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,people think old games were so great but most of them were beatable in like 3 or 4 hours max and had little replayability. not to mention lack of patches meant if a bug was in a game it was there forever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"also, when we bought a rushed game that could have been fixed with couple of updates, we got a game that was going to be broken forever. edit with all this nostalgia going on, we tend to forget that back in the days we had no way of learning about games' problems until we spent our hard earned money on them. there's plenty of games from 80s, that would have probably either been fixed or at least rebalanced with updates if those were a thing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"in the old days you would pay 60 for a game, then never get new content, upgrades, patches, bug fixes, different music, online play, or anything else for years, then hope a sequel would come out. repeat. sorry but romanticizing the days of game cartridges and ntsc tvs is stupid."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"honestly this is such a surface level issue. not only did you get the whole game back then but you also got risks taken which resulted in really unique experiences and franchises which are today, classics, and have usually not failed except when they were turned into multiplayer bullshit or games as a service."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i mean...kinda? our whole thing growing up was the shareware system. you get a discfloppy with like...13 levels, and usually paid a couple dollar to the guy who.copied it for ya. then you dropped the game price on the rest, got it in the mail...and frequently realized the best parts were the free stuff cause that's what hooked you in, and the rest of the games kinda meh. late 90's was the era of expansion packs...where you bought the other half of a game they didn't have time to.finish, or the part of a game they outsourced to make a quick buck. modernized moneymaking just stings more cause you realized you spent 200 extra for some skins and shit pumped out in a week or so but sold over a year"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yes time goes on and things change.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,dude shut the fuck up please. unfinished games have always been a thing so maybe do some research before dropping money on a game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"so stupid. some gamers are so blind and entitled.. super mario bros takes about 2 hours top to finish from start to finish, its a very simple game.. your unfinished game takes about 50 hours without dlc and is extremely complex. both cost the same price. mario was 25.99 in 1985, with inflation makes it to 70 today."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,looks at sonic. remembers the knuckles addon cartridge.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"the image includes what appears to be sonic 1, but in sonic 2 you technically didn't get the full game unless you also bought sonic and knuckles and played 2 through the other allowing you to play as knuckles in 2"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,how ironic.. 20000 upvotes all with no idea how wrong the post is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,but have you considered that i beat old games in less than 5 hours without knowing anything about speedrun while modern games can last me days and weeks and even longer with dlcs?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"i find this post hilariously ironic when they posted street fighter, a game infamous for many many rereleases of the same game charged at full price each time. it's basically dlc before dlc existed. also let's not pretend street fighter has as many gameplay hours or content as most half decent games today"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,we also paid the equivalent of 120 for it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,say what you will about old games. you probably never got passed the first level
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"and so many extras that go with a game. idk if new games do this but i noticed that some older games have sound track folder with... well, soundtrack. it's so cool especially when the soundtrack rocks and you just put on an ipod from there. pretty neat!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,testify!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,preach
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm gonna get downvoted to wazoo for this, but if ya'll don't like this then you need to be willing to pay more for your games. if game prices followed inflation they'd be over 130 today. compound that with the fact that there are a lot more people to pay the wealthy people at the top of the companies need a bigger yacht. companies have tried to find ways to increase price, and if we won't pay more for big aaa games they're going to have to make money on the backend. unless you all want to overthrow capitalism i'm on board this is how it's gonna be."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,amen
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"people saying sf2 isnt a good example are just repeating 1 idiiot's opinion on the matter. sf2 is a complete game, just because theres 5 different versions or whatever doesnt make them incomplete, the game simply was getting revisions and updates and since there's no way to update the game, they would release a new version."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i cant argue with that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"what even is a whole game? the whole story? most games nowadays provide you with the whole story. or do you mean story dlc? back then we called them sequels, still had to pay extra for more game. are you talking about cosmetics? games back then didn't have cosmetics at all, so i guess you are still getting the whole game even though it's less than what's available now. kind of a stupid comment to make really. they were different times. we just had different names for things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,these games were also much smaller. hell i can beat mario bros in about 10 minutes... x200b as a kid i think it took me about two hours to beat it. x200b seriously why do boomers write this stupid garbage. old games are great new games are great too. you get a lot more game for your value. hell 2040 hours being the average is incredible.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,thats true ngl even though i didnt play most of these games because they are older than me i still respect them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i remember when games starting coming out with subscription services i rebelled. i never played world of warcraft because you're telling me i have to play a monthly fee to play a game? get fucked.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"seriously its so fucked up they keep almost half of the game behind paywalls as dlcs and seasons. i fucking payed 80 fucking euros for super deluxe version to be able to play every future shitty expansions but those fucking bastards made a new version later called ultimate version which included newest expansionaddones for 99. so either you pay 99 for this version or 69 for expansionseason pass. this is literally robbery, this is scam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"pssstdont say this in the bf2042 sub, you could hurt eas feelings."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"and it was almost always finished at launch. i'm looking at you, ubisoft."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,word. i hate how they set these things up these days. bp this or dlc that. we already bought the game. why buy more? but idiots just go with it so they do what they want.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i'm so disappointed in halo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,old games where the best!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"people who say this always seem to forget just how many shit games there were back then... they may have technically been complete, but they were by no means complete gaming experiences if you know what i mean."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah and that snes game still had 10 of the content of a modern incomplete game, it was just made super difficult to artificially extend the play time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,guys really cry about paying for cosmetics like it takes away from their gaming experience not having some stupid ass skins lmao
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,kinda funny having a picture of sonic 3 in there since it was one of the few exceptions
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,played through twilight princess this week and the game felt so whole. nintendo is low key the last line of defense.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"bug free experience was given, now it feels like a bonus."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,old games had to stretch themselves out to be worth any money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"it's sad that the new generation needs a carrot on the stick in form of progression e.g. battle pass, unlockable weapons, skins, etc. to enjoy any sort of game now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"occasionally there were hidden characters or maps but you never had to pay to have the full experience, and it was not because the lack of connectivity prevented it, the first games on pc and consoles connected to the internet did not have this stupid idea of selling the game or the characters by parts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,capitalism sucks.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"games weren't meant to be hard or manipulative or trying to appeal to certain type of people, they were just fun and entertaining."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,how the heck did this post blow up
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"there is truth to this but some dlcs add their money's value, like smash ultimate is a great game and by itself larger than all the previous entries, that doesn't mean each dlc character is a rip off or money grubbing, they were developed after the games release. my wife and i get plenty of additional hours with each character added."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yet half of them don't even work properly now without some mod, i mean look at bully scholarship edition on windows 10"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"while i do agree with the concept to an extent i also disagree in certain situations. for example no man's sky and stardew valley being released under the old concept would not have continued to evolve. don't get me wrong i enjoyed early stardew valley, but it has come a long way. all the cosmetics and other micro transactions i could do without for the most part. also many games you can just wait for the complete or game of the year editions normally at the same price as launch."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,me looking at company of heroes 2.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,they would actually rerelease the complete game with small additions at full price again capcom and especially sfii is guilty of this behavior. this was replaced with the expansion  paid patch formula. and then ultimately the dlc  microtransaction craze.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,and we played the whole game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i bought a game i got a ton of other game lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"hmm, i think fighting games are kind of the exception. getting new characters and arenas is kind of cool."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"doesn't that sonic game technically have a part 2 tho, something something knuckles cartridge x200b although all it does is add knuckles as a playable character lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah but if you buy rimworld you get pretty much thousands of dlcs from mods
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this complaint is becoming the next mtv doesn't play music these days. it's barely an observation anymore.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"say what you want about contemporary game companies to be sure, some of their behaviors are inexcusable, but consumers have played a nonnegligible role in the way the industry has transformed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you bought the game and that was it. we can get more than just the bare game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,pokmon main series games have left the chat
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,breath of the wild is a full game in my opinion. those dlc is optional for the consumer to purchase. what grinds my gear is day 1 patches for games that clearly not finished and full of bugs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"except the old mortal combat arcade cabinets were prefilled with extra content that the arcade stores would unlock with secret codes to change modes, unlock characters and add new graphics"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"games from this generation were intentionally made unfairly difficult to pad out the fact that theyre actually extremely short. when you bought a 30 hour arcade beat em up, you were really buying a 23 hour beat em up with a lot of unfair bullshit designed to hinder your progression."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the only game pictured here to successfully inovate and iterate on itself is zelda. while every subsequent zelda title features common themes of adventure and gameplay elements, each game brings more new than old to the table. sonic is formulaic and when they deviate it is complete garbage, so much so that even when the ones that try to recapture what made the genesis games so special come around they fall short. the original sonic games broke the sidescroller mold by adding reckless speed, every addition on later consoles failed to do anything new  unless you count vomit inducing camera angles. mario is mario. you can make the argument that this one has duh raccoon suit doe but it very rarely deviates far enough from the mario formula to feel like something new. the same goes for kart  smash  party  anything else loosely connected to the mario universe that has sequels. street fighter? i don't even need to elaborate there. the point is, it isn't that gaming has become stale. companies have always been beating dead horses when they find something that works. the only thing that has changed is the availability of games. cheap monthly subs that give access to hundreds of games, or even just picking up used games is cheaper and easier than ever. this takes away the excitement of renting a game knowing you only have a few days to make the most of it, so you have to. these days, i'll sit down with a new game and if i'm not 100 invested in the first 15 minutes i'll likely never touch it again because i have so much else to play."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,modern games have dozens if not hundreds of hours of game play. then they release dlc and people get upset.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"although i appreciate the sentiment, there's also a caveat. x200b games from the 90's early 2000's were far shorter than today's games before the dlcs even if stuff is blatantly cut out to be sold as dlc. x200b two sides of the same coin i guess."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i know its easy to say old times are always better, but this isnt true, theres still complete games all over the place and even back then they would release incomplete games sonic 3 or rerelease games a million times with some changes street fighter. no need to be extreme about things guys, were always somewhere in the middle but never perfect."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you still get the whole game for most worth playing,besides, not all dlc is a bad thing, like with total war warhammer where you get dlc support for years with proper big updates for a few bucks"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"tbf, there is an argument to be made about there being less content. for arcade games, it was made to be as difficult as possible or that replaying it was a skill based thing, you had to learn to master this tiny slice of content cus that's all you got. with new content, you still have very little content but it's not been made to last, so you have to buy the next piece of entertainment later on. i can beat halo reach in a few hours, try that with ninja gaiden without having played before and see how quickly it sets you straight!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,y'all ever heard of the smb3 on the gba elevels? the ones you could only play with specific ecards?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i dont mind dlc as long as i feel like im getting a real add on that extends my enjoyment of the game. i dont mind a onetime purchase decision at the end of the game. i dont want to have to think about money or micro transaction conversions while im playing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,its easy to have nostalgia glasses on. but id rather the hundreds and hundreds of yearly game releases with half of them being stinkers then how it used to be. my tip avoid early access and triple a. indie games are in a great place right now.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"sure, thats the case with all of these games that time has deemed classics, but there was plenty of busted, unfinished, unplayable garbage released for the 8but and 16bit eras. so many of them that avgn has been able to produce content about them for like, 15 years. this is just looking at the past through rosecolored glasses."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ah yes old games. you were stuck with whatever game breaking bugs for the rest of your life. those were the days!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,why would you pick sonic and sf2 for this? if anything these games pioneered dlc. sf2 had so many full price updates and sonic had hardware dlc with sonic and knuckles.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,maybe its that you want a different game. or maybe its because you want to be playing a different game so you make the game you're playing look like that other game instead of just playing it. or maybe its that you seem to care more about what others see when you play rather than what you are actually playing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yea you bought broken ass games back then too. they just couldnt patch it unless they rereleased the cart

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what are people saying about old games?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i mean i love retro games too but lets not forget a full game back then was often able to be completed in an hour once you know how to play it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i emulate old games because why not
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"say what you will, but id rather download doom in 46 seconds rather than having to buy 8 floppy disks"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"and then once we were done with it that was all there was to do with it. i like the fact that modern games have a development lifespan that includes updates and the injection of fresh content. old games have their charm, but let's not pretend that street fighter is a game on the same scale as modern open world games. the potential for encountering bugs and issues in a game as massive as red dead redemption 2 can't really be compared to the bugs in sega genesis and nes games. don't forget too that there are a lot of modern games that sucked at launch and were turned into good games over time. back in the day, if a game sucked, it just died and that was it. it'd be a shame if no man's sky had just died at launch. it had plenty of issues to be sure, but the devs were held accountable and a cycle of updates has turned it into a fantastic game. and as others have mentioned, street fighter is about the worst possible game to pick for this comparison, because the street fighter games went through a bazillion minor revisions. seriously, street fighter ii might have been released almost as many times as skyrim."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,to me it's absolute insane that a whole generation of video games is designed to make you feel so bad that you want to spend money to skip arbitrary waiting times and have a good time. wtf is this shit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,low energy comment for a low energy post
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"how many different versions of street fighter ii did we need to buy to get the whole game? 6. you have to rebuy the game 5 more times at full retail price 75, 150 each by today's standards with inflation after the initial purchase in order to get all the content that would be dlc addon content today. and that's not count the alpha games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"when we bought games with bugs that meant you couldn't finish them you were fucked, there was no patch coming. some games couldn't be finished because the developers ran out of time and just had to put in a bit you couldn't beat. the good old days aren't as good as you think. also street fighter 2 had like 12 versions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,to be fair i bought a ton of shitty nes games that would probably be made better by a patch.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,im happy i lived through that era. im happier that modern technology makes it so that my games get updates to fix bugs far more inevitable today with the scope of the software vs back then and expand the content. your 60 today pays for more resources and offers you more in return than it did back then.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,remember golden sun? i like golden sun. golden sun was not a complete game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,wtf does this even mean? most people love old games and most ppl are upset they pay for 12 of the game and the rest is payable dlc. who is this directed to?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"although, the whole game lasted for about 20 hours before you were sick of it, but kept playing because it was too expensive to just buy another one. if you went through it fast enough you could return it and swap for another."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"and sometimes, when you bought the old games, they were absolutely crap and filled with bugs, bugs which couldn't be fixed because updates weren't a thing. see, we remember old games fondly because we only remember the really good ones. for every mario game, there was hundreds or thousands of absolute garbage games. this still holds up today. good games are released all the time, you just also remember the bad ones because it's still current."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,shut the fuck up
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"except you didnt. you got whatever the devs could deliver. youre an absolute clown if you think every game preinternet era was released uncut and perfectly how they wanted it to be released. plenty of unused assets just disappeared or got repurposed for sequels, instead of be added later as either free updates or minor expansions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,there was a whole business in updating the electronics in arcade machines to essentially patch the games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,sure but old nes and many snes games are actually tiny compared to modern games. you can beat all of zelda 2 in a day.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,funny you show sonic which literally delivered half a game in sonic 3 and sold you a second cartridge for the 2nd half at full price.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,sometimes we didn't even get the game at all. chrono trigger wasn't sold in europe on snes. we had to wait until the nds.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i think most of the time people forget that creating the quality of todays games takes 100 more work and money to produce than games 30 or 40yrs ago hell even 10. i mean the quaility upgrade alone games should be 120 bucks a peice considering og mario was like 30 or 40 bucks in todays money. so yes i think they have to chuck the game up and package it out because games now a days offer 100s of hrs of entertainment and look like movies. any other form of entertainment that offers you 100s of hours of fun and looks good usually costs hundreds
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah, and most compensated their short campaigns with an elevated difficulty. games today may have lots of problems, but there are still gems that play hundreds of times better hollow knight, metroid dread, dark souls, doom eternal. i'm not saying this to shit on older games, without those there is nothing to evolve from, but we gotta think about the positives of this era"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,haven't bought an incomplete game in a long time. what games are you guys buying?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you still can.. just buy indie games. if you only play the game with the same graphics as old games, you'll still get somethinig without any mtx."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i mean baldur's gate 3 early access has been the best not a full game game i've bought in a while. i kind of hope that's how rpg and game development goes in the future.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what you will about old games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,shows sonic and street fighter sonic 3 was sold as 2 incomplete games. street fighter 2 had dozens of different versions and some had massive changes to the fighter roster.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"lufia ii was an amazing snes jrpg... however, there were two dungeons buggy as all 'go fuck yourself' and no way to fix them. 3 chests are famously never to be opened, which is bullshit. regardless, great fucking game.... gonna have to get an emulator..."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,karma farming or not this is a real problem with modern gaming. i am so tired of feeling nickel and dimed or trapped by a time vampire that uses psychological manipulation to drive engagement rather than fun. so i won't be playing those sorts of game any more.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,and you also got the bugs that came with them and you never received a patch to fix game breaking bugs. the games also cost more straight up or adjusted for inflation than they do now.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yup, could just be nostalgia on my part but i miss the old days of gaming. no dlc, no season passes, and aaa games weren't regularly released in a buggy unplayable state. it's not all bad now of course, but i do miss the simplicity of what gaming was like in the 90s and early 00s."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i can still hear that zelda game's sound effects. the metallic clang of his sword the background music when the rng overworld mobs pull you into the fight that zhoooooo sound of the battle screen loading. that's weird. i have not thought about that game in decades, but i can still hear the sounds like i have the old boxy controller in my hands now."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this is the way, youngling. good job."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,and you could play them right out of the box too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"if it had stayed at just patching out missed bugs in rushed games that would be fine, the worst part was how it normalised quick delivery and led to what we now call dlc. when expanding a game essentially required a second full release it obligated devs to put effort in and make enough content to be worth it, the witcher 3 and its expansion packs are what used to be considered the norm and i hate feeling old for remembering that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i dont remember having to pay for every single level in a video game. except if you count cosmetics as a essential part of the game. so for fortnite you have to pay thousands just to get the full game apparently
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"and the game guide magazine was a wonder, cheat codes and everything, classic"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,my favorite was playing tekken and beating the game to unlock the secret characters. or doing feats to unlock. everything being behind a money wall just sucks man.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"hurr durr dlc bad we used to call them expansion packs. what happened was a change of name and the means of distribution of the content. hurr durr but expansion backs were big and worth it yes, because it also would have to be worth for the company since it involved physical media, physical distribution, etc. dlc doesn't have all those physical expenses and since it's digital, it can be more fragmented, which can lead to smaller dlc with not as much content. some dlc are worth the price, some aren't. as always, vote with your wallet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"wouldn't be aaa without extra paid content. fuck any company that does that, but fuck ea no matter what"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"just be more judicious with your purchases. nostalgia aside, you can spend 2 hours and beat sonic 2 and have a good time or play the witcher 3 for for 80 hours and walk away feeling like you just experienced a great story. then buy dlc for it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm not at all buying this argument. our definition of complete game has greatly expanded since 30 years ago, hence why street fighter 5 got blasted for not having all the extra modes seen in contemporary fighters."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this new live service is the killer of modern gaming. it sucks, no one wants it. it only benefits the companies to fill their socks up with cash. so much quality has been lost"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i really dont get all the dlc hate. true, if a game releases with barebone content and makes you pay later for the game to actually be playable thats stupid, but if a game already comes with more than enough content i think its okay to pay a little bit for extra content, assuming prices are reasonable"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"though if there's mistakeslacking stuff on the released old game.... not dlc fault, that's evolution, company's fault on utilizing that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,that's so fucking true!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,let's pretend the production cost of old games are even close to recent games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this game no pay to win.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,that's not to say there weren't stinkers back then though. the nintendo seal of quality has always been meaningless
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"well... anyone remember sonic 3, and then sonic and knuckles? that was basically because some content was cut from sonic 3, and sk was effectively the missing content plus some of it's own new stuff."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you know why you now have microtransactions and subscriptions and deluxe editions and dlc for nearly all aaa games? because the cost for making them has gone up a lot over the course of the last two decades but the box price hasn't. the backlash from the default box price going from 50  60 usd was enormous and it caused some of the first games to change their prices to fail outright. no game dev wants to risk wasting millions or tens of millions of dollars on a game that would have sold well if not for consumer backlash. that said, the cost of making games has risen to the point where the box price of aaa games should be somewhere in the 110120 range so devs and producers need to get creative in how they monetize. this led to dlc, season passes, lootboxes, cosmetic marketplaces, microtransactions, etc and many of these systems are optimized to extract as much money out of people as possible because only a fraction of the people who buy the game will ever engage with any optional purchases. i am not writing this to defend the practices that have sprung up from this need to find alternate revenue from a game, but to challenge the complaint that players should be able to buy a full game, with all of the content it will ever have while also benefitting from the massive advances in gaming infrastructure that have happened in the last 20 years, for 60. just last year, aaa games have started being priced at 70 and it won't be too long before that price becomes the new standard, but as time passes, that price will fall further and further behind what it really should cost."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"thats a very biased view. games back then were as unfinished, unbalanced or broken as today. they were only called finished cause there was no tech for a dlc. any new content would become a new game. they were much smaller in complexity, graphics and game length, and were developed with much smaller teams, pretty much like todays indie market. and we don't actually refer to indie market as a benchmark of quality."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yup. back in the cddvd gaming era, even if the game came on multiple discs, the full game was right there, from the moment you bought it. nowadays, there's dlc for this, and expansions for that etc etc, and licensing, which can remove content, or the entire game itself from the store if you have the game digitally, even if you bought it in full."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"say what you want then uses 3 of the best games of all time smb3, sonic 2, street fighter 2 on the image."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"....bugs and all. yes, modern gaming did bring some annoying features like micro transactions. but it did bring with it live patching and balancing, which was especially for the game in the bottom picture."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,street fighter 2 was released in installments up until turbo i think sonic the hedgehog 3 was released as half a game with an option to buy the follow on game. had the dlc built into the cartridge and everything.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"except for final fantasy 2 4  removed entire features of the game, final fantasy 6 evasion bug means you never miss the enemies in battle, shining force 2 took away opening chests in battle because of memory. lots of games were incomplete because of memory issues in those old 16 bit games. oh and shining force 3 which came in 3 parts but us only got part 1"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this is something i miss. it was , in games, you would work and work at a level or a boss, and you would find a secret and unlock this whole new level, or world or something cool. that was the best part, finding the item, or the world , or warp.. something cool like that. don't get me wrong, new games and being able to play with your friends online or make friends all over the world playing a game is the best thing ever.. but we lost a lot of the fun when they started their micro transactions and dlc crap."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the flip side is, we also didn't get f2p games either. granted, some are terrible money grabs with gambling. but even some of those are built on an entire he that is free. apex legends comes to mind. expensive cosmetics, absolutely. but also one of the most complete and incredible shooters on the market. for free!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i do think its worth noting that for some devs whose development cycle is greatly influenced by andor subject to the whims of investors and board members, dlc serves as a vehicle by which they can produce content that they otherwise wouldve been forced to cut entirely. its not always about money. often, im sure, but not always."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,counterpoint loads of older games were buggy pieces of shit and far more games were incredibly short and were just made more difficult to pad out play time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"as an older gamer, i don't agree."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah and our games where much much much much shorter yet we still paid 506070 bucks for them. i hate this whole thinking because people that think and say this completely ignore every other aspect of gaming capability and technology just to make a obvious if faulty point. yeah it sucks when we get sold unfinished games or when they have obviously cut base content out of the game only to sell it for a extra price later i'm looking at you sims 4, but you simply can not compare the game content we got back then to the game content we get nowadays."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"street fighter 2 had at least like 30 different full versions lol. and let's not get started on the whole pokemon gold silver crystal shit, where they're not going to give you the full access to the story  region until the third complete version comes out later. they've been doing this shit for eons, but at least now they can mitigate the amount of money you have to spend for that mistake. i'd rather pay a few bucks for dlc than to have to pay full price again for a new game. do some games get away with murder overcharging for dlc that isn't worth? sure, but it's pretty easy to tell what's a cash grab and what's not if you pay enough attention."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,and it worked.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"on the other hand, old games were dead once published. any bugs or broken bits were forever. the number of 8bit games that were just unplayable, completely unplaytested etc  with no possibility of a fix."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"how thick are your rosetinted lenses? this era of gaming was a fucking nightmare. for every classic there were hundreds of cash grab ripoffs. no internet to know if a game was good. refunds were nonexistent. and if there was a gamebreaking bug there was no way to fix it. and it's not like a game back then was cheap, snes games were 80."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"most old games were reskins of other games before them. i agree with the overall message, but we only remember the games that stood out back then. most of those games hardly were fun due to poor controls and unexplained objectives."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm sorry but i'm so goddamn tired of this kind of sentiment and the whole don't realse a game if it isn't perfect mentality. if most of our cult classic and favorite games were released today, we would rip them a new one. all these glitches and expoloties in older games and fine and part of the experience but in modern games its a death sentence. people expect every next game in the series to be previous game plus 80 new features and it never will be. that's what dlc is for, add new features to an existing game. the thing that proves to me that forums and internet posts are making it hard for us to enjoy new media is that every time q new thing comes out, the last thing is suddenly golden. the star wars prequels, battlefield 5, the andrew garfield spider man movies. now they are all great even when they were ripped apart when they came out. especially with gaming, people we get what they want but the graphics aren't massively better than the other game so the new game is trash. it's getting to the point that and sequels are just gonna get trashed no matter what."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,nobody says anything about old games though. they were awesome.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"uh, there were like six versions of street fighter 2 and each of them was a full priced release that had different content. and there are plenty of times you get the full game these days. you either just need to be patient or buy indie."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,thing is buying a dlc is like paying for more of the game but yeah i agree not buying dlc it feels like you are being ripped off and must feel even worse for a completionist

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"hell at least now the internet has given a form for people to talk, report, and warn each other about various games. if a game is buggy at launch you're pretty guarenteed to know about it unless you're intentionally trying to avoid spoilers. i remember buying games from a shop, and it practically being a coin flip of wether you were going to get a well made game, or an asset flipped, buggy mess. the old games good, new games bad crowd are exactly the same as the old music good, new music bad crowd. of course you only know about the good old games. because we don't really talk about the utter stinkers that got released alongside them. gaming was just as marred by money grubbing, fast turnarounds, buggyness, and outright lies back when i first started, as it is now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i don't think anyone says anything bad about old games lmao

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"its so true. i really miss the days when a game was released and that was it. thats the game, if it had some funny bugs they became fun little things to show off to your friends or when weapons that were op the community self regulated. and occasionally you could buy dlc. like imagine a band releasing an album with half the songs unfinished, and then you slowly get bits and parts of the new songs sent to you but oops now the one song you really liked on the album was just changed completely in the new update and now it sounds like shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,except all the content they had to cut for rom space and time which ended up lost forever. at least now content that didn't make the cut can be released as a part of an expansion or dlc.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"in the case of sonic knuckles you ended up getting free a upgrade on your older sonic games. mega man on the ds did that too, you got extra stuff if you had copies of previous games. then someone realized that spending time playing games you already had would be less time spending money on new games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you ever play hyperchase or berzerk on the vectrex? this is why i call bullshit on your meme.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"there were a lot of crap games too, back then. mario 3 you can beat in a couple hours and it was 50 on release. the tmnt game that released on the nes was hella difficult. when it was ported to pc a certain platform unexpectedly shifted during the transfer, making a certain jump literally impossible, and therefore making the game unbeatable."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"except for sonic 3 and knuckles. and pokemon redblueyelloweverything. and zelda oracle of agesseasons. street fighter 2 had a about a zillion and three progressive editions in both arcades and on consoles that could be variously considered patches and expansions by today's standards  each on a new 50 cartridge. and if you want to think of it that way, the original versions had the boss fighters cut and added in later on a successive full price cartridge release. their data was obviously already in the game, but you couldn't play as them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"sonic 3 and knuckles moment, also nice karma farming"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i just want to say that i don't think dlc is a problem. the problem is when fully completed content is locked behind a paywall on release. dlc brings games longevity and gives players a reason to come back.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,95 of the nes and snes library is literally unfinished buggy trash.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"honestly, you just have to buy the right games. there are plenty of great devs still providing full, working games upon release and frankly it's the fault of consumers for continually purchasing games from known bad actors."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,um..wasn't street fighter 2 sold like 8 different times as a full game when it would have just been dlc content today?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,no you didnt dummy they were broken then too they just had no way of fixing them after they were released.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm so mixed about sf2 being there. i get that they were released in arcades but you can't deny they were milking the living shit out of that ip with minor changes like playing the bosses, adding a few more champs, game mechanic tweak, etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,completely factual information
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,the problem is you get rdr2 for the same price as knack 2. consider the hours and number of employees.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"thats true, lootboxes and ingame shops are the worst  and dont get me started on season passes"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,still the same with indie games. spent 23 on factorio 3 years ago..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"these games were also like 80 dollars and had like 4 hours of content, take off the nostalgia goggles"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i think we lack a clear enough terminology to segregate demand for these games in conversations. if consumers could demand something like offline complete games and stores could have a section for them, we could organize a movement better. other games could be called something like game starters. if you preorder, you're likely buying a game starter"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah... sonic 3
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"indeed. i hang around for goty editions with all the dlc added and bugs fixed, whilst reading the forums and social media posts from people who preordered and tear their hair out at the cost of everything and searching for fixes."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"itt people defending dlc while cherrypicking examples to avoid confronting the point that games are being chopped up piecemeal nowadays, just like people predicted."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,mostly because in the old days there were fewer options of selling people a game piecemeal. of course pokemon has a tradition of only selling you half the game and forcing you into social interactions with someone who bought the other half. at least today you no longer need a gamelink cable. publishers also had a habit of selling what was essentially dlc as a completely new game. reusing the engine and assets but different levels. for pc gaming i fondly remember migh  magic where game iv and v combined into one game when you installed both. also shareware used to be a thing. you got a game with the first few levels or so for free and then had to pay for the rest.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,sonic 3 was not the full game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,sonic and sf2 arent the best examples...

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,imagine the pressure to ship a perfect game. no chance to patch any of those.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,nobody says anything bad about famously good old games lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i mean, there are definitely still games where you buy the full game straightup. wreckfest is a good example. the dlc isn't stuff that's ripped out to be sold to us later, it's genuinely new content."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you still get a whole game with most modern games. you're mistaking dlc as if it was content cut from the original game. where it's actually extra content. name one time you got a snesgenesis game update? shit we didn't even really get that during ps2gcxbox era.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah playing borderlands 2 and im not even done yet and still have to play there dlcs
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i used to be enraged by microtransactions, pay to win, lootboxes, etc. but there are plenty of great games that don't do that. people also complain about early access but i remember when most full games you played were more broken than a lot of early access title people complain about these days. e.g. i love bannerlord, there is a lot wrong with it but i really doubt it would have come out completely done before early access was a thing. they would release it in more or less the same condition and then patch it. it's good that people have higher standards now but it's also good review your perspective now and then. do your research and vote with your wallets and there will generally be games for you. not everyone in the industry is engaging in the microtransaction cash grab or pulling a fast one with early access."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"we will never see games with the depth like chrono trigger or final fantasy 7 gave us. hundreds of hours of single player content, available in full at release."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,hollow knight
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what this meme fails to address is that these games who could be completed in as little as 23 hours. modern games even with some features locked behind dlc right off the bat or features missing at launch and patched in later hold infinitely more value and often times at cheaper prices than those old cart games cost back in the days. for example secret of mana for snes was a whopping 80.00 brand new at retail.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i would have loved dlc or expansions when i was a kid. if you finished a game you really liked and wanted more, you had to pray it got a sequel."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,sonic 3

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,halo 2 map pack for the original xbox was the first dlc that i ever purchased. it was a separate dvd containing something like 4 or 5 additional maps that i bought at electronics boutique now eb games. i passed it around to all of my friends so they could install it for free!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,tell that to those of us that bought sonic 3...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"games having dlc isn't inherently a bad thing. using street fighter as an example, i'd much rather pay for character packs than pay for street fighter ii super ultra turbo edition remix the 3rd at full price after paying full price for every previous iteration"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yup games haven't evolved in a single fuckin way there just incomplete now. you can say alot about retro games but you're straight up stupid if you think the two are comparable.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"still the same today, you just have to buy the right games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,hey guys remember when they split sonic into two games and made you buy a whole ass adapter for part 2? sure love those days with no dlc
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i mean, for every game thats sold just flat out incomplete, a bunch mores dlc is just stuff that didnt make the final cut that they decided to add later"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"undertale, okami, deltarune, oneshot, minecraft, and others would like to speak to you"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"don't even need to use games this old as an example. games in the early 2000's were generally finished polished products, with dlc being a rare add of. battlefront, halo, path of neo, burnout, hitman, etc"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"goddamn that hits different. i mean whenever i play a game that was just amazing i always hope that there will be dlc, to add an extra adventure to what felt like an already complete game. for example, i played fire emblem 3 houses and was desperate for more content so i was happy to get the dlc. but it seems more so that games are half assed or purposely finished leaving a sense that you need the dlc to experience the whole game. dlc being like a mini sequel is awesome, dlc being something you need to have the full experience for the game that should have already been whole is bullshit. but how am i, the consumer, supposed to differentiate between the two when purchasing a game that has dlc options?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,circle jerk karma
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,these games are not as complex though. debugging must be absolute hell now compared to 20 years ago and the assets are a lot more detailed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"remember when you could just put in a code on the main screen and unlock a new character? instead, dropping 5 bucks per character? those were the days"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,it wasnt that great. we got like 8 good games a year if that. now theres 8 good games coming out every week. its just better
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ya but a game from the 90's is 13 of a game from 2020 without dlc
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"but hey things got hard, and we still got games, actually many more than before, so their bet is with these 8bit games, against the actual industry, i dont think any game is bad for the time they got released, but tagging dlc as a bad thing is just plain wrong, because there are free dlc, for games that actually well made at the moment of launch."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"considering the price of games hasn't gone up significantly in the pass t30 years, however the time, effort, and overall cost has, it doesn't surprise me that development companies have moved to a model of dlcspaid expansions. a game in the 90s that cost 59.99 would cost 59.99 today, even though inflation means it should cost 1120 roughly based on inflation from 1991 to 2021."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,the whole game being like 2 hours long
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i wish this was the case today.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,games should be more like minecraft. buy it once and get free expansions forever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,e.t the game allow me to introduce myself.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,we also didn't get instructions with nes games. had to figure everything out with no internet as well!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i love old games! thats why i started collecting retro games stuff recently i bought a sega genesis and bunch of sonic games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,the idea that street fighter 2 is in the example image is so fucking ironic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,looking at the asshats at ea
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i loved when ffvii remake was released, the first patch came out like a year later. every developer should aim for this. yeah i know that the remake is not covering the whole original"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,for real
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,megaman x is the perfect example. cant tell you how many times i jumpscooted up that final level
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you wanna play as goro in mortal kombat? sorry thats a pre order bonus or you can buy him for 15. remember completing fighting games with each character to unlock new fighters and cutscenes? now theres 2 dlcs needed to get the full roster. you wanna play as a berserker in assassins creed valhalla? hahaha its not in game, 15 bruh suck it. oh and its not just cosmetic, it has stats. yeah you! you want the standard game for 99 or the deluxe for 150"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"old games are amazing because of how relatively simple they were, reflect the programmers ability to make due with restricted hardware and often produced by only a few people. id started as two buddies. it's always cool watching documentaries on old gaming."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,maybe you should stop buying incomplete games then buddy. plenty of good complete ones to buy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,game development is long and expensive. for those games it makes sense for me. i dont mind it especially when it encourages me to revisit a game for the new content. i also like supporting game devs i care about it. what is not cool is when content is purposely held back for more money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i also remember getting to unlock cool stuff by playing and going actually tough and interesting challenges. not just complete a battle pass by putting time in or spending money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i am cool with buying an early access game with incredible devcommunity interaction factorio. knowing voices will be heard instead of focusing on the numbers earns my money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,who says bad things about old games? ive never once heard anybody talk shit about sf2 lol in fact its a very beloved game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i used to play demo disc on repeat like they were full games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i mean, i hardly qualify being born in '92.. but we did have some good ass games when i was like 710. miss full games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,we got the full game. not the full and future dlc's.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,youd even get secret levels and achievements
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,considering theres three or four complete versions of street fighter ii floating
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"no, you got whatever they could finish before the deadline. there wasn't more game not because there wasn't anything else to add, but because there just wasn't a practical way to add it. there is no such thing as a finished game, as any game developer will tell you. there will always be something to add, something to tweak, something to fix. every game ever has been released not when it's done, but when it's good enough. where that line of good enough lies is subjective, there is no right answer to where it should go though there are plenty of wrong answers. the only thing that should matter when you're deciding whether to buy a game or dlc or expansion or whatever is whether you think what you'll get is worth the money you're paying, whether you think they hit a high enough bar to be good enough for you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what about games that require dlc to reach the end
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,betas for fucking yearssss
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,but they didn't get updates or multiplayer!oooh forgot to mention there weren't any modding possibilitys in old games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"lol, most games come whole, like 90 of them, stop focusing on the 510 popular games that come out broken every year. its not like you wouldnt fall through maps in n64 games, or have terrible cameras. games are so much more complicated then they use to be. i hate people acting like every game comes out unfinished or broken, ive never encountered this problem with the games i play. besides dlc, but its not like games are not dramatically longer than they use to be. they could have just stuck a number 2 on it back then. sonic 3 for example can be beaten in 3 hrs. full price for a 3 hour game would be shat on today."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i loved the package the games came in and the instructions
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this sub really is just terrible isn't it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you know what i actually am liking about the new free to play games like warzone, halo etc, is that if you aren't tempted by the skins you can just play games for free that you would have paid 75 for before. i still hate that they update games without proper testing, and add crappy content as they go and have tons of bugs, but at least there's one upside"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,as a younger gamer you don't seem to realise that games back then were made by 10 people in like 2 months
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i dont care if a game ships and they roadmapped dlc or repurposed cut content for dlc, i care that games launch completely broken"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i feel like this is only for people with no control and who fall easy towards the marketing strategies of gaming companies with micro transactions, i love free games that require work to acquire what you want, the people who can afford the pay to customize option should go for it, if they just don't have self control then they would have spent it on another thing anyways, the satisfaction i get from earning in game items through grinding compared to the whales is nice too"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,oi somebody remember jazz 2
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,not sure if street fighter 2 is the best example for this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,ur mum resonates with this so damn hard
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you shouldve been said this long ago
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,it always offends me that they make the expansion content up front and just hold it for a few months so they can charge you later

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i love how this starts out with say what you will about old games as if old games mostly get shit talked and are in need of a compliment. it's not say what you will about hitler, but......."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,what's with these boomer as images where it is just... words on top of images?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,but the whole game is unfairly hard as shit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this is some boomer shit plus didn't street fighter 2 re release more than skyrim and gta 5 combined
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"plus , , , , y, b got you extra skins. but you had to pay 6.99 for a game pro magazine to get the code so i guess its a wash."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah, we got super short games that had weird bugs, glitches, and exploits. games that could be finished in, like, six hours tops. take off the rosetinted glasses, bud."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,this has some rboomergamer energy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,just go play hollow knight. it's 15 dollars and a blast for over 40 hours
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,rwhoosh maybe? i mean you have street fighter 2 front and centre yet it had a lot of different releases with minor upgrades that would be a cheap dlc in modern games. i think that does more to support the idea of dlc than be opposed to it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,yasss
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,ok boomer
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,i have always heard this resonates with me. am i wrong? are both right?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,ps2 and wii games back in the day
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"hell, we can't even get a working game now. everything is beta at best during release then after 2 years of us play testing for them may be they'll fix it. we're partly to blame for buying them, playing them, and talking time out of our lives to submit feedback but damn this shits got to come to an end or we'll have another crash of 83."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"except these games had 10 of the content they do now. compare mario 3, or zelda 2 to recent switch games and its not even close how much game youre actually getting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,how many versions of sf2 were there again?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,gotta love adding sf2 when it was the poster child for buy the whole game again for dlc movement. much better these days not having to rebuy games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"anything but the fighting games, yes. the fighting games were technically more full than something like sf5 at release. but they were always piece mealed out, because they thrived in arcade environments where they wanted to sell more machines. so they took that practice directly to the cartridges, something other games couldn't as easily get away with. but the vast majority of early console games in the 90s were very much more full experiences that had definitive beginnings and endings and included unlockables, etc. yes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"and this is precisely why 90 of my gaming is gamecubeps2 and older. i own a switch, and love dread, odyssey, fenyx, etc., but i have more fun with the older games than anything newer. call it nostalgia or whatever, but that's the way i like it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,so corny
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"sort of. nintendo made games so hard that only an expert or someone who bought the guide book could figure it out. zelda for example, great game but without the 60 guide book youre up a creek. same thing with modern mobile games, you get the full game if you spend your entire life on it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"just wait a year, and you buy the whole game as a complete edition for 14 the price."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,what i miss is expansion packs that would add entirely new campaigns to games. it was basically dlc but it felt like getting a whole sequel half the time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,or trying to playing with the things you afraid of. like swimming underwater with monsters. halflife
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"tell me which games are not complete on launch. you can say they don't have as much content or as much polish. but unless it's early access, then the game is by definition, the full game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"this is simply untrue. there are plenty of unused assets and even entire level maps in old game files going back to the nes. plenty of content was cut because they didn't have time to finish it or ran out of storage space for it. they were simply better at hiding the fact that they didn't finish the game exactly and putting a neat bow on it. the difference was you didn't really here about it back then. they also couldn't really patch the missing or busted parts of a game. they could only really complete what their original goals were by making stacker cartridges like those for the genesis or snes. which modified original game content and memory to allow for the full range experience. fixing a game like this was still a thing up into the early 2000's. for instance there is fable in which one could clearly tell where the unfinished content was and then lionhead came out with fable lost chapters. which was literally just the game, actually finished. and if you wanted to play the full game but you bought it when it first released. you basically had to buy the game twice. what changed is that developers getting money to develop before a game was finished became more of a thing. first with preorders and then early access. the good side of this is that many good games that may have never been made otherwise got made. the bad side is that games which would have been made regardless were done lazily under the idea that the second change updates and patches meant they could in theory fix it all later."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"the original street fighter 2 was missing 4 characters, to get them you had to buy the whole game again when they released turbo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"when you buy a game you get the whole game, when i buy a game i have to buy 20 additional characters. yes i play musou games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"idk. im an early 90s gamer and while some things were cool, difficulty could be a little shite. so could not knowing what games were good. not to mention, dlc and updates are kinda nice. new pokemon snap got free levels in an update, i never expected that and id say there was probably 10 worth of extra value.....and the original pokemon snap could have used those for sure!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,thats true since some games just get dlc content but the game is still in beta like why
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,we also got all the bugs and other nonsense that came along with it with no extra content added after the games initial release. p
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,i think the old payment system is so overrated. paying 60 bucks for a game that might be trash
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,street fighter ii is a horrible example with all the expansions it got lmao
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,ok boomer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"no freaking way, you mean the game, box, and a manual  guide in the inside cover? i freaking miss this kinda stuff. actually holding things on your hands."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"without difficulty, old games can actually be completed pretty quickly and a lot of them padded game time with similar looking bad guys, repetitive sprites, and levels."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"so op, where did you find this picture because its got a little moldy over the years"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"its a great point ruined by the image of street fighter 2, which was a situation arguably worse than we have now"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"lol using street fighter as a all back is a bad move, how man editions of street fighter are there? 5?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"yeah but then theres like a billion versions of sf2, also if your game happened to have a game breaking bug and it was prolific enough you are basically screwed forever."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,i've done both and there's positives to both. game back in the 90s had about 5 hours of actual content. it was just placed behind a difficulty curve. usually really steep compared to today. have you ever went back and played some of these games? they don't hold up at all but that's what we had and rose colored glasses tint the framing of the past. i've bought some new release 40 dollar games in 2020 that have 100s of hours of content and 100s mode coming through updates and dlc. just unbelievable amounts of value coming from some teams but i feel people only recognize the big names and ignore the indie devs that are creating masterpieces in our time because it doesn't mesh as well with the idea that gaming used to be better. here's an unpopular truth. it wasn't better. we just put our pasts on a pedestal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"old games had 210 hours of gameplay and were considered complete, new games have 20100 hours of gameplay and are considered incomplete, keep in mind both sell for the same price. not to mention the huge amount of indies we didn't had back then, because everyone needed a big publisher telling them what to do since no one could put the game on shelves by themselves. indies are as complete as aaa games, but cost 13 of the price, so, are modern games really any worse?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"publishers are honestly to blame for the epidemic of half baked games coming out. you got to remember that the actual developers are gamers and hate to see half complete games be released. take bf2042 for example anyone who thinks the devs at dice are sitting there with a giant smile on their face are insane. the way the industry works is a bunch of suits at the publisher funding the development of said games going your releasing on x date because we need to make our quarterly profits for investors. they don't care about the state of the game unless it leads to a drop in sales and profits. the suits in charge are generally businessmen and not gamers many have not even played a game or understand how development works. the devs are powerless because if they don't comply they lose their funding and their dev studio gets shut down. the only way to combat the issue is for people to not support the games which forces change but, no one ever gets on board that train. or you get into a situation where there are mass walkouts at all the major publishers dev studios which is currently happening."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,ubisoft left the chat
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,and the games never got updated
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,almost like the ability to patch games kinda ruined the need to finish them. much more complicated to get right now tho i'm sure.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,well street fighter 2 specifically is one of those games that got multiple revisions adding more content so there is that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"yeah except for the games that were missing chunks due to shipping time cutting them off or just being incomplete and the rereleases of games, looking at you sf2 and the ten not sequels."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,street fighter...really doesnt make your point here.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"street fighter 2 the world warrior street fighter 2 special champion edition super street fighter 2 the new challengers super street fighter 2 turbo these days, each subsequent release would have been a dlc. sce would be the four boss pack for 19.99. new challengers would be either a bundle for 19.99 or 5.99 each character. there would later be a complete edition bundle for 29.99 that included all 8 characters and the turbo function. akuma would be a separate dlc for 8.99. and then we'd have the street fighter movie skins. 0.99 each or 9.99 for the bundle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,being able to patch games is fantastic. dropping in predatory microtransactions should be criminal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"are you kidding? there are buckets of shitty or unfinished games in the nes or snes library. not to mention those that were unplayable because they had only 4 levels and they wanted to counter the rental market. there are good games and bad games in every gen, i say it's easier now to find the good ones though, just don't follow the marketing ads."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,old games weren't trying to achieve anything anywhere near as complicated as new games are trying to do. platformers is just a lazy way of saying different colored boxes to jump on every level.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,i personally dont mind dlc just wished they added a bit more sometimes and they wouldnt cost more than the game itself lol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"true words...today we gotta wait up to 6 months, just to get a decent and somewhat playable version of new games"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"exactly what i was going to say  not sure that paying full price for the 'championship edition', or whatever it was called, was better than buying four characters as dlc like you would these days."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,or sonic. sonic  knuckles was like the first expansion there was.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,and out of all zeldas they picked zelda 2. probably the least polished and most broken one to date. i feel like this image was created by an ai and not a gamer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,if anything fighting games have benefitted the most from the new model. balance updates and characters dripfed through a game's lifetime is a much more sustainable model than release a whole new game for every updateaddition of character. updates do wonders to expand a game's competetive lifetime.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"lol! oh god, i remember when it all happened. is this normal? turbo? champion edition?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"it's not a great example to prove op's point, but i think it's a fantastic example to show how people today like to jump on the bandwagon and talk about the good old days as if they really were better, when they were not. there are plenty of games that release today in fully featured form, but because they plan to eventually release dlc, gamers whine that they're unfinished. a game like donkey kong country 3 can be completed 100 in less than 5 hours without speedrunning. it may have been a whole game, but you were paying 106 in today's money for that 5 hour experience. contrast that with mass effect 3, which was a more popular modern game that was panned for being incomplete because of dlc released soon after launch. that game cost about 72 in today's money and is a complete experience that takes over 30 hours without even doing all the side missions. i will absolutely take the state of today's gaming industry over the state it was in the 90's."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,also people seem to forget that back then games took a lot less time and resources to make. with the current engines you could literally make a snes to ps1 era game all by yourself with less than 5000 and i'm being generous.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah, i actually think fighting games are a good example of a genere where updates rather than a new game help. like, 3rd strike is great, but it would be better if we could update the game so chunli was balanced"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"it also cost like 150 in today's dollars. 150 for eight players, two modes, and a car beatemup minigame."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,well said. i genuinely don't think i've ever bought a game and felt short changed in terms of it not being a full game. it feels like people are shelling out for products they know have dlcs then complaining they didn't get those dlcs for free.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i love the steam reviews that bash a game and the user has like 400 hours. like, number one, if it was that bad why did you spend that long in it? and two, did you not get 400 hours worth of content for 60 bucks? hell i bought dayz when the standalone early access came out for 30 bucks and the game was broken af but i got so many hours of enjoyment out of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"also people buy the game play it, finish it and are saying not a full game when devs sell some costumes to use in multiplayer."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"also, anyone old to actually remember playing these games should also remember they were maybe 1520 hours long at best. the complete game was shorter than most dlcs these days"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah. because of course only the complete games that were the highlights of our childhood would be used as examples of better times. there were shit incomplete games that existed in the past too. very much like how you said there are complete games today.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yea i don't get the argument that games ship incomplete today. i feel like those people just aren't interested in the single player experience because off the top of my head i can name spiderman, god of war, forza horizon, dark souls, blood borne, sekiro, batman, gta, red dead redemption, hollow knight, hades, ori, horizon zero dawn, zelda, mario, super smash bros, fire emblem, dmc 5, astral chain. that's just off the top of my head."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,also just because a game has patches and dlc doesn't mean it wasn't released complete
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"expansions used to be a necessity too because for a game to have a player base, it needed to be on store shelves. so even online games like eq would have to churn out expansions just to get new inventory to put on shelves. i remember games just dying because there was literally no way for a new player to get the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"quake's mission packs were so cool to me as a kid. like woah! they made the game even bigger than it already was?! this is incredible. a game i already loved getting more stuff to do on it? what's not to like? almost three decades later and i still quite like the idea tbh. it's not always done well but i only buy the good dlc. as in, what we used to call expansion packs. but with the advantage of the internet media these days i can easily determine if its a good expansion pack, or a bad one before buying it. as well as if the price is too high for what it is. youtube and howlongtobeat are great tools for this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"older games also released what was there and that was it. 'cut' content wasn't readily available for consumers. the bad games also aren't remembered. if the game sucked for gameplay reasons then generally no one is still talking about it 25years later like goldeneye 64, there were plans to do a unique map maybe weapons for each bond movie. they released it with only the two extra maps. that was it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"still a full length sonic game in its own right. if sonic 3 was released with everything in sonic and knuckles too, it would have been far too long, they would have cut a ton of content and we would never have been able to enjoy the games as they are today. sonic 3 and sonic and knuckles are my favourite sonic titles."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah they literally split up development to release on schedule. but the whole concept of being able to add knuckles to sonic 1 and 2 through sonic and knuckles was pure genius

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"dont forget that games were way more expensive than even the super duper platinum editions are today. street fighter 2 was 75 at launch, which is equivalent to 140 today. and then you had to buy it again 12 months later to get the new updates."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i remember hearing that superman 64 was so successful that they where considering making a playstation version, best thing about modern gaming is learning if a game is complete trash before buying it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i don't know why people always set themselves up for failure by preordering games, especially anything from the aaa industry. how hard is it to wait a couple of days for reviews to see if the game is complete andor has bugs before buying it?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,came here to say this and found your comment first. games used to be ridiculously hard so youd excuse the fact that theres barely any content. nowadays a 10 hour game is perceived as a ripoff. dont buy the dlc if you dont like the extra cost.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"that's not true. i develop games for living on a modern engines. while it's certainly cheaper to make games  you don't have to make your own engine, on a smallersimpler game the cost reduction is barely visible since you need to use a small part of engine say physics for collisions and renderer which is not that hard to write from scratch. the problem is hardware limitations back then made you think hard about your every move due to optimization concerns. now it's easy to neglect such things. however, you need to spend a lot of time to get specific feel for controls, to collisions work just right, etc. which is challenging and time consuming in it's own way. that's programming. if we're talking art  things are more or less similar since you still need a bunch of artists ui, animations, music to pay for their job. 5k would hire you 1 okayish programmer for 1 month. so i'd multiply it at least x10 if we're talking something like street fighter 2 and you have a really solid plan and people that used to work together"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"veteran developer here. your budget is whack, or you're not adequately compensating your workers. the game dev metric for budgeting is 1015kpersonmonth. a contractor month at a low standard of 50hr is still 8k. could an artist produce all of the cell art for street fighter ii in two and a half weeks? street fighter ii took 2 years of dev, cost 4.6m in today's dollars, and involved 20 artists. kickstarter and youtube have produced insanely low expectations for game budgets that have led to some really toxic exchanges, where independent developers paying themselves significantly less than what they could make in a aaa position are accused of fraud and theft because they ran out of money by paying themselves and their employees shitty salaries. i made an gen7 console game in 2009 completely by myself code, game design, art and music just factoring in rent in a lowincome area of 300400mo, food, etc, i went through about 20k, leaving just a few hundreds bucks to my name by the time it shipped. if i'd adequately compensated myself, the budget would've been at least 250k. instead, i worked for the equivalent of literally 2hr. no one should expect that of game devs. don't believe me? try making your own game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"people don't seem to realize that all of these old games have tons of cut content if you actually research them. obviously there are shitty companies doing shitty things with dlc and microtransactions, but there's also a decent amount that are just parts of the game that never would have released at all if dlc didn't exist. also, instead of a 10 dlc pack, if they did release the extra cut content, it was in another full price special addition release, where the only changes were the addition of extra content. kh vs persona 5 is a pretty good modern example of this. persona 5 royal is just added story missions, and easily could have been a 20 dlc pack like kh3 remind. instead it's another full price 60 to get the royal content."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"oh god, that stuff was so common. the manual was written and ready for printing long before the game itself was actually complete, so almost every game had features listed and explained in the manual that had to be cut, or that were drastically changed. they usually had an errata section in the back listing at least some of the stuff that had been changed, but even those couldn't list the latest changes, and were often incorrect themselves."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i bought that game. so much was wrong with it, which sucks because it was such an interesting concept at the time. they released a patch for it, but of course at that time you had to call them and pay for them to ship you a floppy disk with the patch. it may have been available by dialing into them with a modem, which would have been a long distance call lasting as long as it took to download. the patch, which might have been a while."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the only thing legitimately better in the old days was the game manuals. you'd get these thick little books with detailed information about the whole game, lore, illustrations... i used to carry them around and read them for fun. nowadays, you have to buy special editions to get loreart booklets, and even a good manual is probably just a pdf link on the steam page. the flipside is that there wasn't any other good way to get information about a game, so the manual was your only resource  but not all modern games have good online documentation, especially if they're single player and not hugely popular. more often than not i'm stuck trying to glean answers from a dead wiki or a discord server that moves too fast to get a word in edgewise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yep, and then with game pass you have even more access to games. i remember only being able to afford a handful of games each year when i started working my part time job in high school. i also never really kept games, id beat them and then sell to game stop for a fraction of what i had paid for the game. shit now 10 a month and i have almost instant access to hundreds of games? high school me would have been in heaven."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,gaming is just about the cheapest hobby in existence right now. go run the numbers on pretty much any other hobby and the price differential is staggering.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"have ultima online flashbacks here. you're completely correct however. before things like day 1 patches and stuff, expansions were crucial to both fix issues in the original game, rebalance it if it was needed like starcraft as an example, increase playerbases and thus get more customers, keep the franchise alive, and keep people excited with the brandstudio. as awful as blizzard is now not talking the studio issues here although those are awful too i mean their games there was a time when blizzard was beloved. a fiasco like the warcraft 3 reforged edition would have never happened 20 years ago. you could expect the game to be an easy 78 out of 10 minimum and often even higher. people would buy it for the name blizzard on the box alone. they got that way by not only offering fairly polished games, but regular expansions, and staggered their releases so one of there games was always the talk of the community at least every 2 or 3 years. a lot of companies don't need to do that anymore. they can make a game, throw a 50gig day 1 patch, open a player store, and make more money than they ever would've in the 90s and early 2000s where they probably wouldn't have their game even considered if it wasn't from an establishedtrusted company. this is both awesome for many indie devs and awful for many predatory practices. but this also killed the need for expanisons too. especially with the internet news cycle. you don't need a 6 page article in game informer talking about your expansion for the most popular game 2 years ago due in stores in 4 months. you make a tweet and poof. company you haven't seen much of in 5 years suddenly has the most anticipated game for that year. not sure if it's better or worse but it's how the system aged so here we are. fucking horse armor. started all this shit. thanks bethesda."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"sort of. there was an expansion pack that could be physically inserted into the n64. this wasn't really paid dlc, it was more like a graphic card upgrade for a pc that let's you play more advanced games. or in this case, a literal upgrade for the n64."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"that was a ram expansion for the n64, certain games required it like donkey kong 64, a few others ran at a higher resolution with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"what you are thinking of was the 4 mb ram expansion. it just gave the console more capability. you may be mixing that up with the fabled n64 dd which had a very limited release in japan and didn't do well. it was an attachment that you put your nintendo on and it used these big cartridges with a lot more storage were able to get larger games. i don't think it was ever used as a dlc but it could have. honestly they should have went with cds instead of cartridges for the dd and put the stuff that needed to be accessed quickly on the cartridge and slower stuff, like fmvs and the soundtrack, on the dd."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"for no mercy, they released a free version that you had to request through some magazine that fixed an issue with saves randomly disappearing off the cartridge. few people took advantage of the offer so those safer copies of no mercy are few and far between these days."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"not all expansions were bad either. the expansion to the first dragon age was basically another game completely, and i enjoyed the story more than the first."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"expansions like lord of destruction and brood war were close to full on sequels to the original game. now you get like a map, or a cool skin or something."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"some of them were, but it was hardly universal, much like today. dlc is pretty much exactly the same as expansions used to be in general. you generally paid more for popular game expansions that had more content, and less for expansions for more obscure games or that only included a little bit of content. if you actually look at it, dlc is pretty much exactly the same thing and hasn't changed much. i'm not talking about microtransactions, but expansion style dlc that we see in today's games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"its true. expansions were often loaded with hours of solid content and new features. dlc still qualify as expansions, but they do seem to be smaller, and more numerous  and expensive without a season pass. lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"thing is dlc is often made by developers who have no work left to do on the base game and are out on the dlc specific budget. so work does get done because they no longer need the big teams of designers, writers, artists and coders to fix the bugs. so they make those plans in advance and gives plenty of time to create new content, test, polish and bug fix. so it can be released whilst the game still has interest"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"right? they probably just don't remember because they were kids and their parents bought the games for them. considering the amount of content you get for 6070 these days compared to what you got back then.... i'll take the games of today and if i want the dlc, i can get the dlc."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"they released multiple versions of the game with new characters or gameplay tweaks. things that today would be separate dlcs or free updates, but back then you had to buy the entire game again to get those new features. iirc these were the multiple versions released  street fighter ii the world warrior  street fighter ii' champion edition  street fighter ii' turbo hyper fighting  super street fighter ii  the new challengers  super street fighter ii turbo  hyper street fighter ii  the anniversary edition and more recently  super street fighter ii turbo hd remix  2008  ultra street fighter ii the final challengers  2017"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,im taking a shot in the dark but i think it's because they released turbo and super editions with new characters kind of like dlc but you had to buy the whole game again
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,there were half a dozen editions released over the years. each with more characters or more game modes. it became an early video gaming meme to tack more names on something to indicate later versions. or did you not play super street fighter 2 and a half turbo hyper fighting edition with extra cheese?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"sonic 1 had 7 levels that had 3 acts each. thats 21 levels to play through. sonic 2 had 10 levels that had 2 acts each with the last level having 3 acts. so you ultimately get over 20 levels again with this game. sonic 3 had 6 levels that had 2 acts each. thats 12 levels. sonic and knuckles had 6 levels that had 2 acts each. thats 12 levels. i love sonic but saying that sonic 3 is a full length game in its own right is just wrong when comparing it to past sonic games.  if sonic 3 was released with everything in sonic and knuckles too, it would have been far too long no, it would have damn near the same amount of levels that the first two games had before it. edit as others have pointed out, sonic 3 also features no ending to the story, it just rolls the credits after you beat the boss and as a kid you were left very confused."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"as i said in another comment, it's also worth noting that the knuckles cartridge could have sonic 2 plugged into it to allow you to play knuckles in sonic 2 as well which was not part of the original plan at all."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,except for the fact that it had half the levels as past games and an incomplete story.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"it wasn't because they couldn't fit it into one  at least, not primarily. it was mainly because they didn't have enough time to finish the game. when sonic 3 first released, there was a while before sk came out, and this halfgame was all you had available."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,which one? sonic  knuckles? if so that's intentional  the levels are harder because they're the middle of the combined game sonic 3  knuckles.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"most pc games got patches by the late 90s, sure, but sfii and mario 3 in op's image are from like 1991. some pc game patches existed back then, but the vast majority of players didn't know about them, or if they did, they didn't know how to get them home internet wasn't really a thing yet, just walled garden dialup services and even those weren't widely adopted. as far as i know, in 1991, the media on store shelves might get a newer revision of the software but you'd have to buy the game again. some publishers sierra, but i assume others would mail you a disk with a patch if you requested it. and by the mid 90s you could get pc gaming magazine subscriptions that came with a cd that included demos and patches for popular games. but most pc players were stuck with any bugs that were included in the media they bought at babbages or electronics boutique."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i think 4 hours long on most of this games is quite generous.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,oh i dont disagree theyre short cause of tech limitations. but it doesnt change the fact a whole game back then is a vastly different thing from a whole game now. if you released a sprite based game you can beat in a day for full price today people would rightfully trash talk it even if it is fun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i mean yeah but that doesnt change my point. a whole game back then is several hours long, artificially lengthened by usually clunky difficulty. while a whole game now usually doesnt have artificially clunky difficulty and has more content"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,that sonic and knuckles game was good value though in that it could be combined with other games. you could play as knuckles in sonic 2 and for other games you would play special stages unique to that game. sonic 3 was kinda short though but probably became the best game on the genesis once you combined it with sonic  knuckles.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,strictly speaking sonic 3 was supposed to be twice the size as it turned out to be  the developers had to cut it to make the release date  it was the cut bits that made it into sonic and knuckles.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"apparently true, but i was none the wiser as a kid. sonic 3 felt like a full game to me at the time, if i recall sk wasn't full retail nor was it widely known that it was in the pipeline when s3 was released. it was a nice addition with tons of replay."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i love zelda 2, but ill concede that the difficulty is a little unforgiving and the leveling system is a bit unbalanced. the first problem is easily fixed by playing in modern emulation. create periodic save states before each dungeon, and give yourself permission to reverse time and undo any particularly cheesy deaths. for the second problem just put on a podcast or something and grind for a while early on. its a bit boring but its something to do at the end of the day when your brain is fried but youre not yet ready for bed. after that, it becomes much easier to actively enjoy the endgame."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"exactly! and at the time, it wasn't even different from the loz formula. it was the second game, so there was no formula yet. i suck at the game and haven't beaten it, but i honestly think it's more fun than the first."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,there is no such thing as complete  only the point where the developers say fuck it. let's ship.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,then you end up with a game where everyone picks one guy because he is broken op and it's not even a fun game. i guarantee you're the type who would complain about companies never updating games. there is no way to test for every bug in a game. regular updates are a huge part of the development lifecycle.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,certainly not for fighting games. look at how many people poke fun at street fighter 4s iterations. those games would benefit more from updates and dlc than constantly released iterations. it fragments an already small player base and forces you to buy the same game with slight changes just to keep up to date. the genre is simply healthier with it. modern fighting games like dragon ball fighter z have absolutely benefited from this model and were complete games at launch. however i doubt many people would stay around if the game was frozen as it was at launch. the meta is much more healthier now than it was.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i love when y'all just let everyone know you ha e no idea what you're talking about. like yes, early access is unfinished games. that's literally the point. it's slapping you in the face and you're still missing it. basically rather than just having to hope a game works, especially with online, they can have beta testing done. this isn't anything new. this has been done for awhile. and for a lot of studios, they do this so that they can take the money they get from sales and use that to help them finish the game. are there people who abuse it, yes. but you literally explained what it is in the sentence, while also completely missing it. also, you would have gaming today without patches. you're not gonna get fully functional, amazing games. they're getting more and more complex. like i want to say it was the first red dead redemption where someone found there's a rock that is placed improperly so you can fall through the map on one side. however, you have to be prone, and crawl at it sideways. is it a gen breaking bug? no. but with all of the random shit that can go wrong, they're not likely to find everything. unless you're playing indie 2d platformers, there's bound to be bugs. finally, tell me you didn't play many fighting games in the past without telling me you didn't play many fighting games in the past."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,games were harder so it would take longer to beat them. i saw a video on here a few weeks back where someone made an ai to beat tetris and in the video shit was glitching out and the ai just kept powering though the glitches and at one point it just crashed because the game ran out of memory. he had it sped up so i figured it had taken a long time but he mentioned it only took an hour and a half of playing the game for it to crash.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i think the point is that the resources to make a aaa game in 1995 were a lot lower than making a aaa game in 2022.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,or it was released as a 20 expansion. something i remember nobody having any issue with. which is why i roll my eyes when people get pissy about content dlc.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i take exception to this because i own all those old genesis games. yes, they were intended as a single game. but it was made up for by the fact you could plug the other sonic games into the knuckles cartridge and play knuckles in those games too which was not part of the original plan. so i don't really have a problem with this particular instance."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"a better example is banjokazooie and banjotooie, which were supposed to link up the same way sonic  knuckles did to unlock extra content already in the bk cartridge. except they couldn't get the tech working properly and so there's content locked on the bk cartridge permanently."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"a few people fell for it before word spread that the game was garbage this was preinternet for 99 of people so word spread much slower than today and people would be mostly relying on the same magazine that said it was awesome to inform them that it was actually crap, and then add to this that it was released just before christmas. as a result it was one of the topselling games of the year for 1994, and was a top seller for months. the real kick to the nuts is that patching wasn't really a thing for most people back then, so a broken game was never going to work for many and that many stores had a no return policy if the box had been opened."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the maps in sonic 3 were also significantly larger, though and featured far mor gimmicks. dont get me wrong  sonic 3 and sonic  knuckles were clearly conceived as two halves of the same project. however, that doesnt mean that both parts are not fulllength games in their own right."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the maps in sonic 3 are way longer. look at the glitchless speedruns. sonic 3k is around 1 hour, and sonic 2 is around 20 minutes. i know they were conceived as separate projects, but sonic 3 alone is a fairly meaty sonic game based on runtime. it also seems shorter in retrospect because it had save ability, which sonic 2 didn't have."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you're overlooking the fact that the sk cartridge rewarded loyal fans of the series by giving them access to s2k as well as continuing the story in s3k. if they had bundled s3k into one game, we would have never been able to relive sonic 2 with knuckles. quality of content is just as important as quantity."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yup, the amount of translation errors or just components that were missing or broken in old games was pretty bad at times. although overall it was better because the games were so much smaller in scope, so it was easy to find bugs and issues. you didn't have vast worlds to explore in the nes and snes days."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"right? the kicker is that such a game made today, at 60usd, would cost exactly as much as it did 25 years ago. consumers' resistance to literally any methodology by which studios attempt to make any more money might just be a contributing factor to the rampant poor business practices in the industry today. in fact, if you could compile the text of rgaming, the phrase should be free probably accounts for a nonnegligible portion of its word count."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,you learned pretty quick back then that any game that was based on a licensed property was automatically garbage until proven otherwise. thats probably largely still true.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,feel free to compare the past to the present... just don't do it with nostalgia glasses on. games made today are infinitely better than back 20 years ago.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"exactly. look, im not a fan of mtx, and avoid them where possible but thinking that games were somehow perfect back in day, and thinking that not being able to patch and update games was somehow a better system is just wrong."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"i agree! the other thing is that games do become long in the tooth. for instance, i still played my atari 2600 for quite a long time until 2014ish when i bought a ps4. seeing the two connected to the same television and my clear preference toward the ps4 made me realize just how basic and unrewarding playing the 2600 was. i used to say that the nes would never die for me, but the early arcadestyle games are too basic. for the life of me i can't play ice climber, joust, or even donkey kong jr. anymore. modern gaming offers more immersive experiences. the sweet spot seems to be the 16bit and 32bit eras like the snes and ps1. the sega saturn and snes had some truly beautiful, engaging games with gorgeous pixel art. these games aren't bogged down by insane trophy requirements and an additional 40 hours of side quests. that's what kills modern games for me. the dark souls series can do no wrong in my eyes, though!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"the real trick to avoiding the grind is to only level up one stat usually attack in the early game, skipping the others, and then make sure your experience is above the first two stat levels after beating each boss. when you finish a palace you get enough experience to reach your next level, so you want get as much free experience from this as possible. so for example if your attack is at level 4 and your magic and life are at level 1, you can get almost 2000 free experience for completing a palace. the longer you can hold off on leveling the other two stats, the more effective this strategy is."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"chrono trigger is nothing like persona 5 aside from the combat system somewhat i guess. so no worries if it's not to your taste, that's perfectly normal. that being said chrono trigger aswell as persona 5 are two of my favorite games of all time."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"sonic and knuckles was an odd game. it actually had a socket for another genesis game on top of the cartridge. when combined with some other sonic titles, you could play as knuckles in the other game and the other game included areas that could not be accessed without the sonic and knuckles. there were some really weird interactions if you played noncompatable with sonic  knuckles also but i don't remember them."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yes, and a lot of people may not know this, but you can beat a palace without having to take the levelup if you jump past the statue at the end. which is helpful because i find palaces are one of the best places to gain xp. so you can do a very small amount of grinding by going through the first few palaces a couple of times each for xp and skipping the levelup. then when youre six levels away from having everything maxed, just go through all the palaces again which should now be fast and easy to get those last few levels superfast. this also saves you from having to level skills unevenly if you dont feel like doing that strategy."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,yeah my friend bought it for me for christmas one year so i played it as to not waste his money. it was cool getting all the extra post game stuff but it definitely made my original purchase feel hollow. usum was the game they could have made if they had just delayed release for a year or so. but they know they don't have to because pokemon fans and their families in the case of younger players will just keep buying these games and pokemon keeps making the billion
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,and the really dumb thing is every time you try to point out that the dlc model is better than the 3rd version model they had been doing people always without fail instantly point out that buying sm and usum is cheaper than swshdlc as if that is relevant to the discussion. like... bruh. you seriously okay with buying the same game multiple times at full price just because one of the games has a couple of new things? get with the times.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"ok fair. on the gbc and gba games they used nearly all the space they had on the game itself, let alone the specifics of your save file however, i'm guessing there was plenty of space on a ds card to do so."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"there is nothing to modify. the secrets already exists in banjokazooie 6 colored eggs and the ice key and can be collected on a normal cartridge if you happen to know what passwords to put into in the sand castle in treasure trove cove can be found online. the problem is that in bk they are just a collectable but they don't do anything and they were supposed to in tooie which was supposed to be the stopnswop system to unlock some extra goodies. stopnswop was never implemented into tooie. rare had every intention of making this work, it's why they built the collectables into kazooie from the onset. the idea was that in some way you were to swap the cartridges from kazooie to tooie while the console was running and reset in some regard if i remember correctly. the concept was built around how the n64 used it's ram and there was originally enough time to pull off such a thing and have stored memory from one game in the games ram when switching to the other. hence how tooie would have known that you had the collectables. unfortunately between the release of kazooie and tooie nintendo made adjustments in future releases of the n64 and the timing window reduced to a degree that it simply was not possible. as a result stopnswop was never truly implemented into tooie and we have no idea what the initial plans were."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm guessing he only recently checked ebay. some people are supposedly raising the price of their ps4 on there. since people can't get a ps5 because of scalpers, others are being assholes and raising the price for the ps4 to take advantage of it. they would see new ones on there for that much, it people selling collectors edition pro models, and then think their old, dusty model is worth the same. shit like this is why i don't really collect retro games anymore."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,majora's mask and dk 64 are the only ones i can recall. were there any more?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"usually there's a bit of tension when you get to a sonic final boss... like most games. besides, the story set up certain things, like a floating island that never floats, knuckles being tricked by robotnik, which is never really brought up. these things are brought up in sonic and knuckles, which is what's really just the second half of the game, and it shows. just compare the final boss and ending of sonic 2. it was, at the very least, a massive downgrade."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"it had an epic mix version of the soundtrack, a cool animation of all levels you've been going through while the credits where shown and the final image was different depending on getting all the emeralds or not. 9y old me was blown away in '91, it was not like games had a full blown cutscene after finishing anyway."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"they have an big tendency to leave out some very important updates so they can stagger out their expansions for a longer period of time. look at ck2 or hoi4 for a good example of these, the fact that islam wasn't playable in ck2 until the first dlc, or the strange staggering of focus trees for important countries like italy in hoi4. it's nowhere near the worst model out there, but looking at eu4 it can rack up quite a lot for sometimes very small features especially if you include the separation of cosmetic packs in the latest expansions."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,i think the frustration comes from content that is held back from the main game for dlc. i remember dragon age origins having a day 1 dlc character that was clearly developed as part of the main campaign then removed. you also had to pay money on day 1 for the dlc that gave you inventory storage.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,the part where it gets offensive is when features from previous games are sold back to you at an added charge or when important parts of the story are missing behind a paywall. a terrible example would be asura's wrath for ps3xbox360 where the entire last 15 of the game including the ending was released as dlc. in these cases you're not buying more content but instead buying less of a game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this is maybe the worst take you can have concerning video games, and that's including the rampang bigotry of capital g gamers lmao. videogames are one of the most profitable businesses in the world. chairholders and executives make millions. advertisement budgets are often bigger than the budget for developing. you are talking straight bullshit if you think games need to get more expensive. the money gets make. just not by the people that actually do the work. also acting like games don't get finished because they make too little is fucking embarrassing. it's literally the exact opposite. they make too much. aaa games make so much money regardless of their quality that they just get shoveled out and still sell well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"should they really be 100 though? let's look at one of the biggest budget and largest scoped aaa games ever, gta 5. it had an estimated cost of 250 million for development and marketing, and has sold about 155 million units worldwide. even if they sold each copy for just 1.62 they still would have covered their costs, so you don't need to worry about a normal 60 price tag emptying their poor multibillion dollar bank account. but they still felt the need to go and introduce microtransactions, which are now apparently earning them 2.5 million per day. that's absolutely ludicrous and totally eclipses their server costs. still think we should be paying them more?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"asura literally put the end of the story in a day 1 dlc. but typically that's not the problem you get with continuing revenue. the biggest continuing revenue problem i have is when they make a game harder then sell things to speed it upmake it easier, or when they have a competitive multiplayer then sell advantages for cash. dlc is fine, microtransactions are predatory. the best system for dlc aside from classic expansions that add side stories to completed games, is season passes for multiplayer games. things like characters for fightingmoba games and maps for shooters. while the former is a bit controversial because new characters are frequently imbalanced before patches nerf them then you get people upset they bought a powerful character only for them to get nerfed, that format allows devs to stay active on a released game and give content to keep the playerbase engaged."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"like... bruh. you seriously okay with buying the same game multiple times at full price just because one of the games has a couple of new things? get with the times. and this is a bad argument. there are a lot of people who only buy the 3rd version. or, if they do buy both versions, they can sell off the original likely for nearly the same price they bought it for, as pokemon game prices rarely go down. you cannot do that with dlc. it's okay to prefer dlc, and i don't have a problem with dlc in general. but how it has been implemented with pokemon is bad. you paid 60 for an incomplete game and another 30 for short additional content and cannot recoup any part of that cost and still play the game. i welcome dlc, as long as we get a game that feels complete as the base game that the dlc is being added to. if they stuck with the old model, you could enjoy the full content by just paying 60 for a 3rd version. in order to experience the dlc, you have to pay 90 and there is no way around that. and there is no game worth 90 in my mind."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"also, fun fact there was a ton of extra space on blackwhite at least  there were various ds card sizes, based on powers of 2. black and white roms go on a 512mb card, but can be trimmed to like 280, so that's the actual size they needed  just over the next smallest size, 256. so if the eshop infrastructure was there, i think they theoretically could have made a dlc. the ds was just a little too early, i think."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,didn't anthem get shit on because it got repetitive after completing the 40 hour campaign? i played the campaign before getting online and thought it was a fun game and looked forward to some expansions. then i got online and saw people who had played 200300 hours calling it shit and boring and how there was nothing to do after spending 100 hours minmaxing their loadouts. don't act like a 60 game that only lasts 45 hours would be good enough. people in this subreddit are so confusing. games should be complete when i buy them! and where is the gta v story dlc??!! gta online ruined everything!! seems like the pattern is gamers don't want developers to do what is best for business.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,most simulator games are like that as well.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"fair enough, i've never played the sims except old school sim city. so that's one game out of ten thousand."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,have to disagree on this point. i don't think people realize how much content changed as story went from text to cutscence to fully voiced. an hour of text based dialog will tend to have vastly more content than an hour of spoken dialog. using time to compare them doesn't make as much sense in those cases.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,go play senkei densetsu 3. and since when playtime  value?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"well, we didnt have websites back then but we did have plenty of reviews in the form of magazines i still have a closet full of old nintendo power, video games  computer entertainment, gamepro, etc. and just like today, reviews are no guarantee of enjoyment but if every single review is like, this is a janky piece of garbage  or if none of the major magazines reviewed the game at all  you could reasonably guess you should stay away. and of course, just like today, patient gamers were rewarded. if you just waited a year or two, you could pick up a game after its retail price dropped down to 20 or less, or get it used at a garage sale or flea market for 5 or 10. honestly, thats how i got almost all of my games the only one i think i paid full retail for on release day was super mario bros 3, and if ever there was an nes game with great prerelease buzz that was virtually guaranteed to be worth it, smb3 was it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,i said you cant do that. not that it cant be done. and super mario 64 still isn't an nes game. idk why you're trying to compare the two. you kids have no idea how hard games used to be.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,is this your coping technique? ironic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i'm not trying to say those games are better, just that it's silly to think people are paying out their ass for super short games. that's just 1 console too. skyrim and witcher 3 are from completely different console generations. not to mention how much of skyrim's content comes from modding. also i'm gonna be honest, outside of the dlc, witcher 3 is one of the most overrated and repetitive games of all time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i enjoyed the art style a lot, very stylized. but i couldn't deal with the downtime. i got through fire emblem three houses 4 times for each ending, but even that was wearing on me. if i wanted to read a 599 page book worth of words i would read a book. i can't get into too much dialogue anymore. i'm adhd, and too old and don't have enough time for it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,well it is. arguably the best jrpg there is. the combat system and the fights are genuinely inspired and great. but that's just halt of the game so if you don't like the other half that does nothing for you.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yeah, you could only play mp on perfect dark. ironically the expansion pack also broke a few games. the 1.0 us release of space station silicon valley and i think rogue squadron both didn't play well with the expansion pack."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i never got the expansion pack for the n64, yet i played the fuck outta the mp with bots, i usually only used the crossbow cause i loved the bolts sticking outta peoples faces....young me was wild"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,that's why one was included free bundled with the game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"specifically, the game had a memory leak the devs could never track down. eventually the system would run out of memory and crash the game. by adding more ram with the expansion pack, it took a lot longer for the memory to run out and crash the game. the game would crash after ten hours, not ten minutes. the devs figured people probably wouldn't play that long all in one sitting, so it was okay. after all, the memory got reset every time the players turned off the console."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,that holds no validity in a conversation about shit releases. were talking about the bad ones and why there damaging. strawmanning dosent really add anything
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"they're one in the same, how don't you get that? even nintendo has mk world tour or whatever. you can cherry pick games like ghost of tsushima, from soft games, etc., both of which are extremely popular, but they are outliers, and calling attention to them only provides defense of the aaa industry as a whole. none of them need y'all to cape for them, i fcking promise you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,at least 23rds of it wasn't cut and repackaged as progression rewards or dlc.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,how do you expect aaa games to be made by a dozen?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"yes, because of inflation. 60 was worth more a few decades ago than it is now. even with the savings they make in manufacturing they'd still make less profit today if they sold them at the same price. those features aren't exactly needed are they, they're luxury features. if you could only get the car with all these features it wouldn't make the car cheaper, you'd just have to pay the full price. you also have to consider that just because there's more customers doesn't mean you'll get these customers to buy your product."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"im going to stop after we used to get more content out of our games, because this entire post is detailing exactly how that is false and youre just having nostalgic flashbacks through rose colored glasses. gamer and streamers consume content at a greater rate now than they ever have, 100 hours a week for many people. live balancing, updates, battle passes, always something new on the horizon. that never used to be a thing. if you want complete games for 1 price plenty of developers are still making games like that. youre upset at capitalism and those complaints are valid to an extent. but in 2022 getting 5002000 hours of entertainment for 60 and you all screaming like you deserve every cosmetic unlockable in every game for free makes you all a bunch of entitled babies."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,it also sold 4x as many copies because the market for games has massively increased in size.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"yeah, and shigeru miyamoto said they would need to sell 2 million copies to cover the cost of making the game. instead they sold 24 million and then laughed all the way to the bank with their 1,100 profit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"yes, and have you seen the absolutely obscene difference in capabilities in game engines, multimedia processing, and crossplatform compatibility? games have grown in scope because the technology allows for it. its not even a matter of opinion  its fact  game companies make loads more money today and they did in the nes days despite games being more expensive to develop. these billionaire ceos do not need more money simply because the people they pay to develop games do a better job."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"you're contradicting yourself though. the consumer is voting with their wallet, but theyre also saying they have a price they are willing to pay. when everybody complains about a price increase, that's the consumer. people complaining about microtransactions is common place exactly because they don't want them"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"they paid 60 dollars for something like gta iii in 2002. if they also paid 60 dollars for gta v in 2014, and gta v has a much larger scope than iii, is it indeed what people have asked for? have people indeed voted with their wallets for scope creep?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"i never said anything like that. i just said games don't need to be this massive budget undertaking with huge 100gb game files and photorealistic graphics. risk of rain 2 is a game that was released a couple years ago and it's infinitely more fun and engaging than any aaa title that's dropped in the past 10 years. it isn't graphically impressive, it doesn't have a soap opera story, it's just a fun game that you can play for hundreds of hours and it was made by a small team of people. even more surprisingly to the people on this subreddit, is that it was released in a complete state. there is no microtransactions. it didn't put the developers family's in debt. it's literally only your shitty aaa games that have these terrible issues and cause people to complain all the time. aaa is an anti consumer format, and people understand that, that's why everyone complains about it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,people overworked the n64 from day 1. zelda runs at 2025fps on a good day. in combat it probably goes down to single digits. but that was alright as 3d took a ton of processor power and was something new at the time.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"mk world tour isnt aaa, which is what were discussing here. i cant think of a aaa nintendo game that uses predatory monetization you pay full price and you get a good, finished game. same goes with essentially every other studio i mentioned, which isnt cherry picking. collectively these studios outrelease and outshine those broken ass games. like seriously, just start naming franchises. broken ones  call of duty  battlefield  2k  nba  nfl  destiny  anthem  fallout those are the corrupted franchises i can think of. now list the good franchises  zelda  mario 3d, paper, and 2d  metroid  dk  kirby  yoshi  mario kart  horizon  ghost  uncharted  the last of us  god of war  spiderman  souls including sekiro  doom  control  ratchet and clank  red dead  stellaris  civilization and these are only games i could think of for gf the top of my head with recent releases, i could go on and on the further back in time we go. and im absolutely certain im forgetting some good and bad games, but im also pretty sure the good is still going to outweigh the bad. im not defending the bad games, im defending the good ones."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,if they cut 23rd of a game back then you would be left with one hour of game... even with everything in there it was a fraction of complexity and game time from the same or even more price than the games are today
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,they don't have to be aaa games to have longevity. stop assuming aaa is worth comparison with anything. we spent hundreds of hours on games like quake and those had absolutely tiny teams that made them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"but there are more customers buying the product, what the fuck are you talking about? super mario bros. blew minds and made headlines selling a record 38 million copies worldwide, then halo comes along and sells 70 million. the numbers are objectively going up this easy to prove"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"this is completely stupid. the amount of content is the same, and i'll give you an example, one where the series in question is single player games that have been plagued by the rest of the industry's practices. tales of symphonia released 20 years ago with 8 characters, each of which had five or six costumes, all unlockable within the game. tales of arise, released last year with six characters, that had maybe three costumes, unlockable within the game, and then three more each that you spend 3 dollars on each, or you can generously buy a ten dollar pack with costumes for four characters. oh and arise clocks in about ten hours less than symphonia, but i mean if you wanna continue being wrong about the amount of content in old games compared to new, that's your problem."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,screeches you were my friend! i never told anyone!! why wouldn't you just do me dude!!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"theyre a company. their purpose is to make money. whats your point? holy hell, if everyone here had their way everything on earth would be free. company makes money  theyre the devil!!!! you people are ridiculous."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"shuntaro furukawas net worth is 10 million. but who am i to point out actually facts, right? that would ruin your argument lol. and thats besides the point. games cost more to develop because the teams needed to make them are far larger. the scalescope of the amount of people and time needed to develop games today are so much larger than the nes days. its not that the teams stayed the same and because technology is better they can make the games we see today, which is your argument and is flat out wrong. the teams are bigger, the time needed is longer, and yes more money is spent on marketing. all of that leads to much larger development costs by comparison and the fact games havent changed prices in 40 years is insane."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"no, i am not contradicting myself. you actually just did that yourself. people scream bloody murder about microtransactions, but guess what? they keep paying them. and the keep paying for dlcs too. if the industry actually changed to 100 for aa games i am confident people would still pay that price, but instead companies will just keep them at 60 and have a few 20 dlcs instead."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"sure but they always paid 60 dollars. people will pay 60 dollars for a game. people get upset when they have to pay more than that. if you need to charge more than 60 dollars to make your game profitable, you aren't listening to what people want. everyone always wants bigger and better but what they're willing to pay is also a factor if you're a developer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,yes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-10,"youre responding to the wrong comment with this take. the person above me said that nobody asked for games to be big and i disagree. if people didnt want big games, they wouldnt buy them. i also disagree and think people absolutely would pay more than 60 for games. theyre already doing it by buying the initial game for 60 and 23 dlcs for 20 a pop. theyre paying 100 for games, just in installments."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"did you read my fucking comment? i agreed that there are more customers now. however, that doesn't mean they're going to buy every game that comes out. some games flop hard to the point that some companies have gone bankrupt due to bad sales for big budget games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-09,"was that a point you were trying to make? do you think skins  content? no wonder you cant really grasp this conversation. ill break it down to a 7th grade reading level for you out of necessity. hobbies are expensive. riding a bike, painting, playing an instrument, shooting, fishing, golfing, many things we do to get hours and hours of enjoyment require considerable upfront costs, or considerable reoccurring costs. gaming, in the long run, is a very cheap hobby where you can get thousands of hours of entertainment for not so much money."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-11,"correct me if i'm wrong, but i believe the story goes like this a brother and sister are playing in their tree house when it collapses, killing both of them. both are taken to the limbo, what some theologians consider to be the edge of hell, a neither heaven nor hell kind of place. the sister is scared and runs away only to get lost. when the boy becomes conscious, he realizes his sister is gone, and goes out to search for her. when the brother and sister are reunited at the end, the endgame title screen shows their two dead bodies surrounded by flies."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i think he or they dies in a car crash. you go on to relive analogies for every stage of his life 1. the mysterious forest representing his childhood, where everything seems strange and unknown and spiders are your biggest fears. 2. then it's school, along with its bullies. 3. a traveling job, a lonely life of flickering motel signs. 4. working in a factory. 5. car crash. you get thrown around, up, down, left, right...and at the very last moment, you fly through the windshield."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"the ending seems to depict the boy, lying dead, after many years have passed, since flies buzz around his body and moss has grown on the ceiling. my guess the boy and his sister had both been trapped down there for some length of time, and when he reunited with his sister after searching for her for so long, he found that all that was between her and escaping limbo was a gap between her and the ladder that was twice her height. her brother gave her a boost to help her escape, knowing that he could grab the ladder after her. when the young girl reached the top, her brother grabbed onto the rope ladder, his extra weight causing the rope ladder to snap. he then, knowing there was no alternative route, let his sister go, and was left to rot. oh god, why did i have to realize this..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,i thought the game was going to loop and you would work your way round to the starting screen.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"there are a lot of interesting things about this game, and my theories are far from cohesive, but i have made certain observations that i think deserve some review. the game begins with the boy waking up in the forest, which, in a sense, could resemble the dawn of man, being that before manmade structure there were only the earth's natural environments. as you progress through the game, the environments become more and more polluted with human constructs, and little by little these constructs obscurereplace the features of the initial area. at first, there are the small, shabby, wooden villages, still surrounded by the trees of the forest, and then the more technologically advanced areas such as the iconic hotel setting, with the foresty features only present in the distant background, and then into the age of industry where the game has the player literally climbing all over giant gears, and then, suddenly, back into the forest. as you can see, the game escorts the player through the development of humanity, or rather, human society, and then brings them back to its origins. as for how this relates to the symbolism or whatever of the game as literature, i think it is that the player has been involved in a tragic accident, a car accident, in which he and his sister were both killed. this is why, at the end of the game, you break through a pane of glass this represents how your character was thrown through the windshield by the force of the wreck. and they say that in the moments before you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes, right? well, take the protagonist as a character representation of all of man, and there you have it. his entire timeline, as humanity itself, flashes before his eyes, through the agrarian forests and the shantytowns of the olden days, the cities of present and into the very heart of industry. as far as bringing the player back to the beginning, i think it is sort of a foreboding thing, a sequence trying to express that due to our technological advances and manipulation of our surroundings that we've reached the end of our civilization's cycle, and that it's high time for an ice age or some shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-11,"this has to be one of the most moving games i have ever played. not only was it a well executed puzzleplatformer game, it had an incredible unspoken story to go along with it. well worth the money spent. i had to have a few cigarettes after playing this game... fuck..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"limbo is an utterly dark and beautiful game, and this brought back some old feels of mine. thank you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"lemme throw in my two cents on this. it's gonna be a kind of weird one. i don't believe limbo has a story. it's got a great atmosphere and personally, i believe that that's the main point of the game. don't get me wrong, i loved it and it was a great and almost magical, depressing playthrough for me, but as much as i wrestled with a story, i had to admit it would be difficult to apply one that perfectly fit the entire setting. thus, i came up with a different idea limbo isn't trying to send out any sort of plot points like in a normal story. this is a story of emotions and i tracked mine as i went along. for example, nature felt like paranoia because i didn't know what i could touch before dying and all of the people i met there behaved oddly. on the other hand, i felt like the final area was more loneliness. here we come upon a place which should be brimming with peoplea hoteland instead we're met with emptiness and left to fend off electric wires and dangerous machinery alone. in the end, i kind of have to step back and see whatever is there as little more than an attempt to quantify subjective data, to take what little objective data we can things meant to set the mood and make a cohesive narrative out of it. really it's kind of beautiful in a way, people connecting with someone who they can't even really see or know the story of. still, the story we tell about this game seems to tell more about us than it does the little silhouette of a man running around purgatory."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"the boy built a treehouse in the forest to play with his sister. maybe because he built it poorly they both fell and died there are 2 corpses with flies around them and the ladder is broken in the end shot although they don't realize they are dead until the end of the game. the boy is now in limbo, some sort of purgatory and starts looking for his sister. perhaps because he is indirectly responsible for her death the path back to her is littered with dangers, trials he must go through to prove he cares about his sister before being allowed into heaven the ladder. the game takes you through childhood fears like spiders, bullies, fear of adulthood as represented by the monstrous machines. when he finally reaches his sister she is waiting for him near the ladder, which isn't broken because it is the path to heaven from limbo, oblivious to her own death, trying to revive him. the boy understands what has happened and hesitates. she hears his steps and looks up. we cut back to the real world and there are two corpses under the tree house. the ladder is broken. the end."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-11,"i didn't look at limbo as a game, but as art."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"the first time i played the game, i thought when he lands after bursting through the glass wall put him in the exact same place as in the beginning. after standing up i didn't bother to run around, and ended up taking an entirely different story away from the game  about him stuck in limbo  until my second playthrough."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"anyone got any other games like this with an amazing story and different ways to interpret it. already played limbo, bastion and to the moon."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"major feels in this game. it's incredibly dark, as when you play through it seems like a purgatory inhabited by the souls of dead children some of them are feral and violent, while others are scared and try to keep othersmonsters out. how the siblings died is a mystery, tbh i always thought they were murdered or something while outside playing, but the theory posited by the top post about their tree house collapsing sounds more likely to me."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-11,"that's what i gathered from it when i first played it. not quite as specifically but more like brother wakes up in a type of 'puragtory'. the last thing he remembers is being with his sister, so naturally, he goes looking for her. over the course of the game and many deaths, it becomes obvious that you're dead, and likely your sister is too. good to know i wasn't far off. oh, and one of my favorite games of all time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-11,"and then when the game ends, and the brother finally finds his sister the game automatically restarts. i kinda thought that was a little symbolism of purgatory itself doomed to repeat the same stuff over and over until you finally move on to the next plane of existence after being judged."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,that whole dead bodies and flies thing is the first thing you see on its website
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"the impressive thing is that non of this is actually stated, but give or take a few details, no one who has played the game would disagree. if only there was more story telling like this in games. instead we're usually stuck with so then the brutes took over and cast out the elites and the prophets are gonna destroy the galaxy unless armor guy can stop them lol hifive gais"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"huh, never though about it like that. the way i say it was that the brother and sister were in some sort of accident, but it didn't kill them, it put them into comas. so the game is the brother running through limbo, which i think means between life and death, to find his sister and wake up with her."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,i did not think of it that way.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,who's going to be a good lad here and post the related pictures?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i hate when i don't finish a game, and then find out it has some underlying analogous story that would have changed the entire experience for me. no i didn't stop playing cuz i didn't like the game, i just have too many games to play."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"you, sir, deserve upvotes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-11,there are two clumps of flies flying around what could be two dead bodies. you can see a more noticeable bump where the boy was at.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"figure out you're dead and then... onward. what i love about the game is that it has these largr issues, but also fantastic secondtosecond control. arnt from playdead is a master, who does not get the respect he deserves because he is quiet and not a selfaggrandizing jerk."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,there are 2 swarms of flies
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"it could also mean the rope ladder snapped on her, causing her to fall and kill her. the boy, not being able to handle such a moment after all he went through, kills himself. that's how i'd like to think of it anyway. life is sickeningly poetic and ironic, like that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"that's it, i can't handle the theories anymore, they all seem pretty good. someone call in the devs!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"that's what i thought was going to happen too! if they did end it that way, i would've just said fuck this, i can't handle this then curled up in the fetal position for several hours. i mean, being trapped in that hellscape for all eternity, doomed to repeat it again and again? shudder as depressing as the ending is presumed to be, at least it provided closure."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,another point to add weight to this idea is that the killing of the spider and then the use of the flying bug could be seen as man's taming the beasts and domesticating food sources.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i hope you got a chance to play braid as well. i had to read up on it after beating the game because it is obscure as hell, but after seeing all the explanations i was walking around in awe for days."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i kinda just sat there, staring at my tv. one of the best games of all time. i still think about it today. right when the game slowed down as you flew through the glass, i was speechless."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i agree. the game was well made but i kept waiting for something to happen that would tie it all together i mentioned braid elsewhere in this thread, so i think my expectations for storytelling were set very high. i honestly do not think the makers concentrated on making a coherent story the vagueness probably adds to the experience, as indicated by the numerous theories in these comments. having said that, some games manage to achieve great success by ways of both atmosphere and storytelling, namely bioshock imho. in one of the final scenes they managed to simultaneously explain pertinent plotpoints and very eloquently break the 4th wall. very vague, minor spoiler never before have i seen a linear game justify its gameplay mechanics through a plot device. i think i remember being fucked with in similar ways before only by the films the game and fight club. damn fincher.spoiler more recently, i think metro did storyimmersion really well."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"it's one of those things that was amazing and should be left at that. some things need sequels to expand on the world, but limbo would lose something in the expansion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,it's not really something that would work in the context of a sequel. part of the game is figuring out and interpreting what happened. any additional information would ruin the game conceptually.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"in my secret dreams, laika and henry selick team up again to create an entirely dialogueless black and white movie adaptation, in which it's left ambiguous at the beginning, and the story is about the boy who has to defeat a giant spider using his wits, finding a giant abandoned and decrepit clockwork factory, and other obstacles, painting an allegorical picture of how they died maybe they were playing in a dangerous abandoned warehouse? maybe they fell into a creek, or maybe they got lost in the woods. but it's alluded to as the movie progresses. he is constantly driven forward by visions of his sister, around the corner or in the distace, that he calls to until he finally catches up with her in the middle of a field beneith a tree, and it ends when she finally hears him."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i bought braid and limbo in a recent steam sale for 2.50 each. i jumped on braid first because of all the hype. it was good, some of the puzzle elements made me smile then i put it down after an hour. i picked up limbo and it just was one of the best few hours of gaming i've ever had. the main thing for me was how much it made me nostalgic about earlier 2d puzzle games like abe's odyssey. not one puzzle element overstayed it's welcome. you'd get introduced to it and then you'd keep it in your arsenal for the rest of the game. you would try and put the story together before the game ends but then you're left with all this symbolism to arrange in your head for the next 15 minutes. no one's interpretation here is really wrong or right, it's a personal journey."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,i couldn't get in to braid. i like to complete things on the first playthrough and either this isn't possible on braid or i just suck at it and couldn't get all the dam puzzle pieces.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"they're not mutually exclusive in that they often overlap but they're two totally different concepts if by game he was referring to something more in line with the overall game play mechanics. in this case, limbo had a strong storyline and good overall aesthetic that carried its, honestly, mediocre gameplay mechanics. i, personally, only played the game for it's artsy appeal, finding that it wasn't really doing anything new in the world of platforms as far as mechanics were concerned."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,lies! my first playthrough took four hours.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"you're right, i know, shame on me. you see the thing is ... im not in elementary or middle school anymore. i would have said high school, but i didnt have much free time then either for vidya games with work and all. so not being in elementary or middle school means that my parents aren't paying for everything i own and do. therefore i must work at a job to earn money in order to pay for everything i own and do. i basically have a steam library now full of games from steam sales etc, just like everyone, and i don't have time to play them all. usually i use game time to play the games i want to the most, and limbo just hasn't been high enough on the list. i did begin playing, just never continued it. plus, a lot of the time i just start games up to make sure they installed correctly and never play them again. i can't tell you how many games died on my desktop. games are just coming out too fast nowadays.. i mean hell i haven't finished a single ac either, wanna know why? because by the time you get halfway throught the game, we already have 2 more assassins creed games out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,i didn't finish braid either. i feel like i should.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"i bought braid and limbo at around the same time and both of them are my 2 favorite platformers. i love the art style in both of them. braid is significantly more difficult than limbo though so it took me awhile to beat it, going through months where i just gave up then randomly picking it up again."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-12,"unless your going to provide it, yes, it is! for many people, 500 is close to their rent, or two months of groceries! especially, for young independent adults2230yrs, 500 is alot of money! and your giving someone shit for not dropping 500 on a computer to play a game, and act like its incomprehensible that they might find this a hardship?!? then you mock people for pointing out that not everyone can just drop grants like its nothing?!? your the worst kind of person."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-13,"couple things 1. didn't demand a thing. 2. a lot 3. didn't give anybody any shit except you. 4. smooth editing. i did read it before though, what was it again? go fuck yourself, you entitled piece of shit. that's probably your strongest argument yet, very eloquent. good luck being angry all the time, i hope you get everything you've ever wanted handed to you. and don't worry, i'll keep working and paying taxes so you can keep getting your welfare checks."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,there's some extreme bangers in the play queue. op is in for a wild ride.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"what im about to share is not bragging. its more like a confession. my game spreadsheet catalogs my collection of roughly 6,000 games. it includes each games title original and released as, platform, launcher, original year of release, developer, igdbs critical rating, genre, visual perspective, theme, play mode single player, coop, etc, my personal achievements high score, completion, etc and the date i achieved it. making it, i learned a lot about spreadsheets and video games. i think in the end the most important lessons i learned were about myself."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,play kotor 2! though 1 would be higher on my ratings lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"love seeing outer wilds with a perfect score, hard agree. highly recommend bumping prey up your play queue. its an absolute banger, and if you enjoyed somas philosophical elements, youll dig prey a lot. putting the forgotten city on the queue instead of eventually. its pretty short and sweet and definitely scratched that outer wilds itch for me. drop subnautica below zero or put it wayyyy back in the backlog. it was okay but fell way short of the originals charm."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,anyone else satisfied that outer wilds is 3rd place and outer worlds is 3rd from the bottom? just makes the list look nice and symmetrical.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,seeing as elden ring is in your favourites i dont see why demon souls is not under the play if i get a playstation section
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,so was rdr2 your first ever rpg? im always curious as to why its so disproportionatly loved on reddit as a 1010 yet ive never actually met anyone who thinks that in person. i personally have it average rated as a 7.2 since 4 in gameplay 7 in story tellingpacing 7 in art direction and world design 8 in sound and music flex slot 10 in graphical fidelity

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,glad you like soma i love that game so much
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,i would for sure add bioshock 2 to the list of games to play. you can get the trilogy remastered somewhat cheap now and thats my favorite games of all time so i recommend hopping to that. also id play last of us sooner rather then later unless you watched the series. my only addition to your list which is amazing! is the borderlands games. not so much one because its a bit dated and hard to get into but those games are a recipe for fun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,if titanfall 2 won't make it into favorites i will be very disappointed...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,i recommend adding sekiro to ur future games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,did i miss you playing starfield without mods?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,i would move baldurs gate 3 up your queue. i would also insist you try witcher 3.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"i know it's not next on the list but titanfall 2 is amazing, you should deffo play it asap"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"our ratings would be very similar... some notes fallout 3 should be a priority... the lore of fallout is soooo good. seems you like sims as well... so i'd suggest the tropico series, cities skylines, civilization series, surviving mars, and planetbase."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,do you by chance play eve? lmao
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,why though
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"ive done a similar sheet before. just a quick heads up if you want more objective rankings per se, then you should probably divide games into categories and rate each category accordingly. that way, youll get a more complete picture of your favorite game. your rating inflation is too high. on a 110 scale, if youre using the same scale that game reviewers use, then 7.5ish should be the average."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i do the same but a bit different. mine is all games in one list and then there's a big pie chart with 4 categories completed, ongoing, not started and unlimited games that basically don't have an ending like racing, mmo or fighting games. by every game there is a completed date. it's too late now, but i wish i put a started date too so i know how long it took me to complete some games. the list is almost 400 titles now and my goal is to have every single one on completed by the end of my life. the reason why i started this list is bcs i replayed some games on and on and got bored with gaming. by having this thing, i played through titles that i knew for years but never touched them. there's just something in that green completed that makes you want to discover what's next."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,i do this too!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,what's soma?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"love the list! but if i may make a small suggestion? do resident evil 2 before 4. not for story progression or anything, but man oh man itll whet your appetite for 4 like you wouldnt believe"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,gotta put part 2 alongside the last of us
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"... if you're ranking games out of 10 but using decimal points as well, why not just rank them out of 100? other than that, you've done well if you have managed not to play any games you thought were shit!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,original half life is a must if you haven't played it before.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,damn i should do this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i used to keep a spreadsheet similar to this, then i found out about playnite. you can import your steam, xbox, switch, and ps games or any custom games and categorize them the same way i.e., completed, score, not yet completed, want to play. not 100 sure how you would handle the play queue but i guess you could make that a custom field called play queue and then rank each game e.g., 10 for cyberpunk, 9 for inside, etc. its nice because it gives you a visual library since it downloads covers and artwork and also allows you to filter and sort easily. one of my favorite features if i dont know what i want to play is to click random game which essentially picks a random game from your library you can exclude games youve beaten or already played. send me a message if you have any questions about playnite. it took me about a day to set up and i totally abandoned my spreadsheet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,agree with most of those scores but bioshock at 8.4 is highly suspect. you likely didn't play the title when it first released so i'll let it slide
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,bloodborne is at the top of the list of you get a playstation. a dude of class

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"it makes me feel so out of touch when i see people with lists of game they've played and it has a ton of different games in it, because i feel like nothing gets me excited nowadays. last two games i got hyped for were persona 5 royal back in october 2022 and that wasn't even a new game and payday 3, which came out recently but suffers from a lack of update a month after its release. i envy people who can play very different genres of game and still have fun."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"this is a new one, with only games i mean. i often see this but with trophy hunters and completion percentages, difficulty, estimated time, etc. there was a time when one guy on rtrophies posted his spreadsheet and people started popping out of nowhere with their own creations. i swear, every time i opened a thread, it was an ever better one. im talking line graphs, charts, and literally the most confusing shit ever lol. good list tho. you definitely have some quality stuff on deck."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"i also keep a spreadsheet on my gaming. but im mostly just keeping track of what games ive completed from what system. ive gotten into retro gaming in the last couple of years, so its fun to watch the list grow. i dont personally like generating numbers to describe how i feel about a game, but i do also keep lists in my notes app of the games ive completed by system ranked based on personal preference rather than ranking on a stricter critical review system. its fun to organize."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"you and i have similar tastes, id move god of war 2018 up your list to play."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,do you have anything for games you dont like? or are you good enough at picking them that it doesnt happen much?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"soma was a 9.8!?!? the story was pretty peak tbf, but the gameplay was kinda garbo. except that one puzzle where they spell out to you how the consciousness copying works if you haven't wrapped your head around it yet"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"would recommend putting in life is strange1, before the storm, true colors in the might play section. those games aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have great stories and characters that can maybe be relatable to you. i don't see spiderman in there either, they are fun games if you like spiderman. the batman games are must play, people hate on batman arkham origins but i'd recommend you play it and arkham knight. god of war 2018 is brilliant. i love seeing lists like these of people who play games just to enjoy them and maybe walk away with something if not at the very least a good time."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"cool list! i will definitely be checking out your top 3 at some point. currently thoroughly enjoying my first time through hollow knight  masterpiece imo along with elden ring. there is such an absurd number of extremely great games now, it's hard to keep track, let alone try to play them all. this is a handy way to keep it organized  might do something similar myself."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"i figured i'd mention that it's baldur's gate iii, not baulders gate 3. it's possible you don't care, but i figure for someone exacting enough to make a spreadsheet for this sort of thing, you may care about the accuracy of the name."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"i was about to suggest adding prey to your list, but i'm glad to see its in there already assuming its the 2016 prey. prey has by far the best level design i've ever seen in any game. the entire game world makes sense from a story and gameplay standpoint. the space station feels lived in, like an actual place that could exist and be run by people and function. and just like real life, there usually isn't just one way to get to somewhere you want to be, and the game gives you tools to bypass locked areas using a bit of thinking and experimenting. there's one section where you go into the lab that runs and repairs the 3d screens around the station, and the devs of the game made a 3d color grid test that 100 percent makes sense. its like the color bar tests used on real life monitors, just pushed into the 3rd dimension. its a small detail but to me it showcased the amount of effort put into to making a believable environment."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"i'll say that, in my opinion, deus ex mankind divided is both better and not as good as human revolution. mapsetting wise i think i liked hr more, but gameplay wise mk is an improvement. even let's you properly beat bosses without killing them! still absolutely worth checking out as it's a direct continuation of hr. if you like deus ex, you'll definitely love dishonored. probably one of my top series by far. just don't forget the dlcside games, and consider deathloop if you like dishonored. different setting and not for everyone, but it's very dishonoredlike. i also recommend sekiro, but just know that it is a hard game. you can definitely feel it's made by fromsoft, but it's plays nothing like elden ring or other souls games. still, i highly recommend it if you can stick it out. last, if you don't mind a rhythm oriented game, i highly recommend hifi rush. came out this year and is personally my game of the year though i haven't played baldur's gate or finished totk, so that skews things a bit. it's also on game pass, so if you get into that, you don't need to pay full price!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,it holds a special place in my heart. its one of very few games that had me dwelling on its story for weeks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,whats the full name?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"lol yeah i do this to kill time, mostly on lunch breaks cuz find ranking stuff fun. my movies and shows ones are even bigger"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,brains like what they like
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,that's only because this would feel like a job to you. to other people like op this is fun to do.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"shockingly, some people find it pleasing to keep things and lists organized."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,chrono effing trigger
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"if you like chrono trigger, you should check out sea of stars. it's a pure love letter to the snes era rpgs. i'm about halfway through and i love it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"beat every campaign on legendary a couple months ago for the first time ever in about a month i think im ready for a replay lol, of the first three that is. excellent series"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"that's totally valid!! i had nv higher for the longest time but recently moved fo4 up when i looked back at how much i enjoyed each game. nv is 100 the better rpg, but i think the actionvisualsthe fact i live in boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. i do wish it had as many clans and groups as nv did though!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,it's in the play eventually section!! i do think ill love that one but the amount of game there is can be a bit daunting  full intention on doing a full playthrough though!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,do you mean  baulders gate
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i'm actually surprised this is the first comment questioning the low portal 1 placement  for some reason as a kid, i played portal 2 and skipped 1 but years later i went back to 1 and it just felt underwhelming compared to the scale of 2. definitely a great game, but unfortunately i ended up mostly comparing it to 2"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"when i was young i played 2 without 1 for some reason, i recently went back to 1 and was underwhelmed comparing it to 2  still an absolute classic and a great game!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"ooo hell yes!! i'll add those to the list, because i have a strong feeling i'm going to love journey!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"that's a really good shout, i forgot about that one!! added"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,especially since uncharted is listed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,then he should check out system shock after that since he loves bioshock also
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,i'd recommend black mesa tbh hl1 looks a little rough these days. hl2 is still decent though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,fo3 above both
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,its one of those games. a game i wish i could forget so that i could experience it again for the first time. it starts slow but its very worth it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,i do think i'll play those ones eventually!! i kept the playstation list on the shorter side for the ones the really excite me but the spiderman games do look pretty cool too!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,it looks really good!!! it's in early access so i'm waiting to see if a bunch more content comes out before i start it  but the styledetective gameplay has me keeping a close eye on it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"also, didn't see the metal gear solid series"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"tbh the first time i played, the flight controls and the wonkiness of walking around on giant's deep made me quit an hour in. i questioned all the praise it would get on here and eventually gave it another shot before it finally clicked! my favorite part of the game is how thought out and intricate the solar system and it's physics really were! i really appreciate how unique each planet is and how it's dynamics worked perfectly with the time loop. i love mysteries so finding out stuff along the way that i literally couldve done at any point with the tools i've had the whole time to solve the final puzzle within 30 minutes. when things finally started clicking and made me feel like a genius, it just made me appreciate how well thought out every single bit of the game and design really was. i had genuine curiosity to find out what happened to the nomai and figure out the unique physics of each of the planets that i've found so hard to match by another game! and the way music plays into the game, the soundtrack as a whole, and the epicness of score of the final mission was amazing! all leading up to the ending which i felt was super well done, invoking some sort of existential feeling thats hard to explain. i cant fault you for hating the gameplay though, since i felt it too when i first playedquit ahahah. im just so lucky it finally clicked for me, which, if it doesnt happen for you and the physicsstory dont connect to you thats okay too!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,the ambiencecolor scheme in that game was unlike anything i've played and sooo cool!! i really wanted to meet the girl in the end though ill admit lol the section where you feel like you are being watched is so unforgettable though! will def check out the hellblade game !
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-11-01,omg i need to check this out!!! thank you so much!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"that's totally valid!! i had nv higher for the longest time but recently moved fo4 up when i looked back at how much i enjoyed each game. nv is 100 the better rpg, but i think the actionvisualsthe fact i live in boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. i do wish it had as many clans and groups as nv did though!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"it definitely is a slow burn! for me a lot of the fun was actually just vibing! going around and robbing peopleenjoying the sceneryhuntingfinding a new arearandom encounters was such a vibe during the pandemic for me and spending time getting to know the crew and hanging around camp made the big momentstwists in the late game super hard hitting  and the end emotional!! i do get the criticism i see a lot that it feels like a chore with certain aspects, so i do feel like it gets better if you start to get attached to the characters but can deff take awhile to get there"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"the game gets a little bit better until you get to the end of chapter 3, then it gets exponentially better. there's a pretty lengthy compilation of streamers at the beginning of the game talking about how boring it is and then by the end of the game they're, let's just say all in."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"no, it doesn't."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-11-01,"i'm not a rdr2 fanboy, it get's a little better but not by much, it stays extremely slow and scripted in missions, the world opens up a bit more to do some side activities but they are not rewarding or anything, just flavor."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"the story has 6 chapters, and an epilogue. 50 of the story is told in 4.5 chapters, the other 50 only in 1.5 chapters. however, before some people disagree with me, until reaching that point where the story escalates and you go doing mission after mission, there are plenty of things to do in the open world. rockstar gives the player the freedom of exploring a full and lively open world, compensating for the linearness of the main missions. game offers amazing views, from big cities to creepy swamps vast grasslands to challenging mountainous paths livestock towns to deserts and much more. the prologue, or the first chapter to be more clear, is very slow. the 2nd and 3rd chapters are where you should engage with the open world the most, to hunt, to play games, to interact with npcs, events etc. from the middle of ch. 4 and onward is a downhill for the story, it becomes quite gripping and may even be hard to follow. but it is definitely a game that has a lot to offer, an incredible detailed world and characters that feel real."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"as a bostonian i just had to!! i've walked down half those streets irl, such a fun experience"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i was going to say, no minecraft?!?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,with how much hype it's getting online in super pumped to be able to give it a move up from the queue
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"story wise those 2 deff have stray beat, i really don't know what it is about stray but i was just so engulfed in that world! visuals aren't everything but i also think that game was one of the most gorgeous ones i've ever played with the neon lights and reflections i also loved the aesthetic of the greenerynature combining with the cyberpunk. i also loved exploring the civilization of robot people and learning about them! it just holds a special place in my heart!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,i read somewhere that they can be played out of order and everyone keeps hyping up 4 to the point i shot it up a bunch out of excitement lol but if it's better to play then in order maybe i should contain myself and wait ahahah
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"autism, probably."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,prey and phantom liberty are superior.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i read somewhere that sekiro is harder so part of me is just lowkey scared i won't progress lol, i barely beat elden beast by the skin of my teeth. i do really wanna try it though!!  a buddy of mine told me ragnarok hits better if you play them back to back so i'm half waiting to see when it's coming to pc and half waiting to see if i'll get a playstation. but i fully expect god of war gamea to be 9s or 10s"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,it's actually in my top 10!!  my goodness that game is fantastic. i listen to the soundtrack to chill still
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"ahaha yeah that one turned some heads  when i was young i skipped 1 and played 2 for some odd reason, and when i played 1 recently i felt underwhelmed comparing it to 2  definitely a classic and deserving of all the praise it gets!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,yeah for sure!! i'll dm you a copy when i get home from work!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"outer worlds was deff not the most fun for me, just pretty visuals  i will say kotor is deff a good game i can see why people love, but i had the twist spoiled for me and am not huge on the combat system so it didn't go super high, but i think if the twist was a full surprise it would've been up a few slots on my personal enjoyment scale! great characters for sure though"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,lol tbf the bigger one isn't in order just the shorter queue!! i feel like i would be in more of a rush to play it if i hadn't already watched the entire game on youtube  but i do fully plan on playing it myself some day!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"both incredible games!! but ranked on enjoyment, i had to give skyrim the edge partially due to nostalgia and being my first rpg! i remember watching it on youtube as a kid and finally buying it with my own money. such a special place in my heart!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"grim fandango is a masterpiece, it's a must play"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,for the longest time i had new vegas higher but recently thought back to each game and how much fun i had  moved fallout 4 up. i really liked how new vegas had a ton more groups to interact with but i think i just personally enjoyed fallout 4 more due to the combatvibeand exploration more. part of it is also that i live in boston and it was kinda crazy how accurate some of the areas were  so it was cool exploring and fighting on streets i've been on before. i also loved the story and i filtrating the institute
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,i have a fiance  i know when we get married next year i won't be gaming much so trying to get through my catalog ahahaba
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"that's why i keep pushing it back, im worried characters will feel bland afterwards lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,luckily i actually haven't played a game id consider bad yet !! i rank based on soo many things but mainly how much fun am i having? does it feel like a chore to do certain parts? how much am i connecting to this gamehow engulfed into this world am i? am i craving exploring and finding more? how much do i wanna go home and play this game? and stuff like soundtrackgameplaygraphicsatmospherestoryending factor in too !
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,my memory is kinda bad so sometimes i just like reading back what games i've played and it helps me remember my favorite ones!! like i look at certain titles and just reminisce what parts i adored. mostly a time killer during lunch breaks though
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,those ones are ones im considering moving up to the queue once i get through the current ones!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,thank you my friend!! i've actually not had a game i didn't like so far luckily!! if i had one below a 7 id probably just drop it though  i mostly avoid games i know i wouldn't like too
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,ahaha i'm sorry!! the combat wasn't my favorite and the twist got spoiled for me so it took a bit of a hit for my enjoyment scale  still incredible characters that deserved a slot in the great section !

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"a lot of it comes from the itch.io racial justice bundle, a few years of epic giveaways, retro games from various compilations and packs, a few different subscriptions, and all of the games ive accumulated physically or digitally over the years. the spreadsheet has been great for the bundles and compilations, which is where i tend to get lost. that itch.io bundle alone is full of hidden gems."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"ive got igdbs critical score in there, which is actually really weird. most of the highly rated games are what youd expect, with some exceptions. the highest rated game in my collection is jurassic park for nes, somehow."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"ok, you talked me into it. im on my way out the door to work, but ill figure out how to share it this afternoon. it feels like opening my zen garden to the public, because thats exactly what this sheet is to me."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,i love the settlement building and it genuinely ruined going back to other fallout games for me because i can't do it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"if you have rdr2, skyrim and cyberpunk in there then witcher 3 should be a no brainer. make sure you get the version with the 2 dlcs as it's practically an extra game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"if you don't mind playing older games, you should try witcher 1 and 2, they are way shorter than the 3"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,not that much if you don't want to collect all skellige question marks with is just loot in the sea. base  dlcs are shorter than rdr2

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-11-01,"yeah it was just beautiful and relaxing. you forgot about the world and all other things playing it. i mean we all wanted to, to be honest  do that, i think you wont be disappointed based on your list!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-11-01,"i saw you mentioning being in love with mass effect now i do not know what is going on in that game, but from what i understood enderal and mass effect trilogy share common concept of the world and plot simply put, enderal is mass effect trilogy under skyrim's skin seeing you hyped made me curious, mind to share your experience once you thouch the enderal?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"told in 4.5 chapters chapter 2,3,6"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"is it that accurate? i didn't realize! i'm playing through now 40 levels in and i'm loving it so much, played nv, 3 76 before this and i've gotta say this has been by far my fav fallout experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,that's awesome! o got a rec bullet storm! super duper fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i grew up playing so much minecraft but didn't feel like it had enough of a story to rank it compared to such different types of games. but with how influential it's been on my life, it would be top 3 if i had to rank it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"you're correct, even story wise i prefer stray too. just an awesome game from start to finish"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,really depends on the person. i found sekiro to be easier than elden ring. it is faster but parry focused and more aggressive. the lack of equipment and stat leveling means you dont have to worry about having a bad build but you also wont be able to overlevel to beat a hard boss. imo its more satisfying that way so i prefer sekiros combat but both are great games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,favorite soundtrack? mine is between nkg and greenpath.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,me too please if you don't mind. this is awesome!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"it is not a must play the puzzles are horrid. if you're willing to look up puzzle solutions when you get stuck, then ok maybe. but that's not really playing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,the issue that has plagued the outer wilds since it released. always mixed up with worlds..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"i struggle giving things low scores and the ones i really hate i just don't finish so i can't rank but agree that outer worlds felt p bland, esp coming off of the crew from mass effect. the graphics in that game are one of the compliments i can give it tho, the world's had some super pretty colors!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"that's fair enough! did you play it years after it came out? when it was first released it was absolutely amazing, the graphics haven't held up well over time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,do you file them alphabetically. like d for doughnut.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"i mean, its completely optional. theres no reason to manually land on the sun station except to say that you did."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,i just wish there was a little more hand holding it explaining what you are supposed to do. i should watch a tips and tricks video. my younger self would have loved the less hand holding. have the new easier game styles made me soft?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"yeah i didn't really enjoy it. i feel like i would've enjoyed it more, if it had not been for everyone on the internet treating it as the holy grail of gaming. i understood the plot in like an hour, explored for a few more hours and then beat it. at the end i was just confused as to what the big fuss was all about. a great puzzle adventure game, sure. but i wouldn't call it one of the greatest games of all time like many claim."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"bg3 is an amazing game. the sheer level of quality and tedious detail put into every last square inch of that game is unrivaled by any game i've ever played or even heard of. i would say you should bump it up in your queue, but it'll make every other game feel meh after you play it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-30,"its only similar to me in that dialogue can have consequences. everything else is different so not sure why that comparison was made but its still a good game, at least the first act is"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"given the effort youve obviously put into this spreadsheet, i suspect you might come to hate bg3  youll have to introduce a new category for games that score 1110."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"a short hike was a very pleasant way to spend an hour. i had a little kick of underwater games abzu, beyond blue, and in other waters. having developers listed helped me realize i love annapurna, so ive explored some of their stuff machinarium, samorost, creaks. there so many more, but those are some of the most memorable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"yeah understandable, the puzzles do feel like too much sometimes. it's satisfying to complete them but it can get frustrating. i really enjoyed the conclusion so would recommend you to finish it but do note that you will want to do the dlc as well since that's essentially the final conclusion and it might not feel complete without it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"nah this is the vast majority of peoples experience playing the game. after the tutorial section your free to roam so checking out each location does give you something to do for a few hours. the frustration comes imo from the fact that since its a nonlinear game, the info you do find is all relative and usually somewhat out of order, which makes it really hard to get a grip on whats going on. once you hit this point you more or less have to trust that it will start to make sense the more you play. eventually when you start making connections the game becomes the best thing youve ever played. my suggestion is to pick a location in the solar system, explore it, and if there is info mentioning another location try to go there next. if you follow a string of clues like this its way easier to understand the underlying narrative. once you make it farther into the game, there will be puzzles that you get stuck on. my advice is to try exploring elsewhere because the answer to some of these puzzles are located in a completely different area of the solar system. good luck and youre in for a treat."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-31,"for what it's worth, i gave up an hour in my first time and only returned months later because people on reddit loved it so much and now look where i have it  once you get it, you get it. just gotta keep exploring everything you can on each planet until you can start connecting dots to progress further on each! if you're stuck, move onto the next planet"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i like a good fps, i really do. but it's the one that has to go. rpg's are simply everywhere and have worked their way into damn near everything while action games basically went and did that from the get go. without these two, we'd lose the vast majority of games. so those two immediately get to stay. strategy games you can just... lose yourself in for days at time. new approaches, new experiences, experimentation is often rewarded. i'd also throw board games in this category. fps's sometimes have a solid campaign to play, but more often than not it's dropping you into the multiplayer side of gaming and that shit is just oozing toxicity far too often."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"strategy but moba in particular. never got the apeal of this sub genre. i used to like civ though. also action is way too broad. fps are action games. some rpg are action games too and fps too, like fallout 3"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"fps, that genre has been stagnant for years"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,rpg
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"so if a game has elements of say action and also rpg, and we kill off actionwhat are we left with"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,somewhere i lost in the feed was git rid of loot boxes
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i see a just cause game, i am very happy"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,technically all games need strategy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,no
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"but here comes the question, what about the games that mix genres? like the souls series being action rpgs, or borderlandsfallout being both rpgs and fpss"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps is not a genre
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,bye fps
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,no.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps definitely isnt going
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i haven't enjoyed an fps since timesplitters 2
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"in my opinion, strategy because it's too slow for me and a bit boring"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,can i just vote mobile versions of any of these genres off?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i mean if i were to pick one it would be fps, but then i'd lost doom eternal soooooooo i don't want to pick. can we just cull turn based? edit  typos"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps there i said it. we'd be much better off if frames per second was gone forever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,nuke the strategie games. they can be cool but it's one of my least favorit genre so...

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"racing games espicially games like burnout series, nfs ,forza ,gran turismo ,forza motorsport for realism"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"well the only rpgs i like are actionrpgs for the most part, so if its a turnbased rpg, i say axe that. you can always play turn based card games or dd and such. same goes for strategy, action yes, turn based i can lose."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,rpgs are ass
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"strategy, action, and fps can kinda all be in one, look at arma, even that has rpg elements at time. but i'd go for rpg, i'm not a fan haha"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,probably rpg. they are so long that i usually can't finish them. i suppose turn based rpgs will survive because they'll come under strategy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,strategy

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,you know that strategy is used everyday in games whether it's is or not the right type of gaming genre right
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,well witcher 3 rpg element is just above average
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps. overdone these days and nothing really new has come to fps. seems like fps games are just recycled into a new world every other game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i'm not sure what kind of rpg you're talking about but if it's the league of legends type let me personally execute it

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"yeah, none of these. sports can go. fps titles get ragged on hard, not sure why. doom, halo, half life, metro, bioshock, wolfenstein, l4d, borderlands, far cry, team fortress? giving the likes of those up just seems bonkers to me. based on what, a couple of twitch shooters? even the likes of call of duty had solid campaigns way back when."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i would eliminate strategy tbh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i choose fps genre to go.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,surely action  well thats just my opinion
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"action, fuck that barely defined shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,easy. action games. all the other genres are prime colors but action is orange. action is often just a glorified first person except that you have to look at the back of your characters head and butt and don't need to aim properly to play the game. and the rpg and strategy mechanics of the game are often lacking.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,action i guess.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps be gone!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i... uuuhhh... fps? although thats a really hard choice, and its hard exclusively because of doom"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,how do you create an fps without action?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps is a subcategory of action
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"fps. if one has to go, then fps can go. i don't even play strategy, but i know that it's a important genre in bringing mechanics. rpg is pillar of most fascinating stories and also has brought a lot of gameplay mechanics. action is vague but covers a lot of ground, we might accidentally obliterate great games. despite being the most played and favorite genre realistically speaking, i still will choose fps to go. i live my life in first person, i think that is enough disappointment for a lifetime. ironically, i do hope fp part is not drowned with fps, because i think the future of fpnons virtual reality games would be sight to behold."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"fps. havent played one since doom ii, unless you count portal."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,strategy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"probably strategy. there aren't many strategy games that have managed to keep me engaged for more than an hour, and they normally devolve into a big waiting game"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"well, i wanna say fps because i don't play them at all, the only that pains me is doom eternal, but i think its a decent price to pay to have everything else ughh"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps obviously just make every current fps third person.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,strategy is usually a waste of time for me but my second choice would be fps they become repetative

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i think fps. yes, there are still good games with fps, but big games like cod have really ruined it. the only ones that i personally enjoy are the halo series just starting no story spoilers please! and overwatch, and thats pretty much it. every other genre can bring something interesting to the table, especially strategy and rpg."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"idk tbh. the only fpss i care about are metroid prime and halo but theyre still really fun. strategy, well i like fire emblem and advance wars too much, plus id probably like ff tactics if i ever play that. action, i dont know what the game pictured is but i do like bayonetta, dmc, ninja gaiden, god of war, most platinum games, etc. plus action rpgs like tales and kh. rpgs, well youre insane if you got rid of that. i guess id go with sports. the mario sports games are fun but thats about it"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,action is a bit vague isn't it? all of the 3 other genres could be action.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,if it was for myself personally i would say rpg because i dont play them personally but for all round i would say strategy games because most of them are just mobile games

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps definitely i like halo but could still live with out it. goldeneye was good for its time and the same with doom. but don't really play them anymore same with cod. would rather have the other three
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps can die. here let me shoot it in the face. oh shit it's not dead after 50 rounds and shot me once. now i'm dead getting teabagged by an aim bot 10 year old that had sex with my mom.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,this is a very hard choice but maybe stradegy simply bc fps games have stradegy in them. idk which one id choose tho
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,when was the last time strategy was even mentioned. never! because there are too many newbs in the world. it's my mission to go to these other games and teach strategy. there is no where to hide. unless your playing zelda!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i'm bored of fps so fps. not enough innovation in the last 20 years compared to those other genres. well maybe strategy is a bit stagnant but they're like chess, untouchable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,my first instinct is fps but that i want to keep for just fir halo. action can go i suppose as i'm not really sure what it is
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i hate fps so im picking that. most fps games are either reboots or rehashing of the same content anyway seems like

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"action....a bunch of interactive movies hailed as masterpieces in gaming. strategy is the definition of gaming, some fps titles carried console gaming to it's mainstream popularity, rpg's are the immersive worlds people want to get lost in... action gotta go. i can do without a 5 minute cutscene leading into the 600th stealth mission where the ai is dogshit and the mechanics are lackluster. tlou and uncharted are highly overrated."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps obviously. cant live without my strategy games and having a game for some op rpg fantasies are great. action games can be in all sorts of manners so more diverse than what fps can offer
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,strategy. its fun for some time and then it just gets boring

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,since action is not a clear describtion i will take it out. you could describe anything with some kind of action. strategy has action so does an fps. so this was a very easy question.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"apologize for length does anyone think developers having a union to leverage against the publishers would hurt or help? each genre has so much to explore if given the freedom but publishers chase the dollars not innovation. i was just talking with my young nephew on how his generation has missed out on the wonder of gaming due to redundant franchises, micro transactions, and the utter lack any new ip's to grab the imagination each genre is on the chopping block bc publishers care more about pushing out consoles that cost more and more. they force developers to release games with more bugs than a jungle. wouldn't it be great if instead we were talking the genre currently pushing innovation rather than being terrible enough for the cutting block. fps was initially a novel idea but i miss watching my avatar move around interacting in the world. i live pov, the point of video games is no different than movies, escapism. each genre has had their bright spot for everyone but now i notice people speaking of fond memories from the past not their excitement of a new title coming out."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,what is an action game? a pitiful pile of mechanics! hurls wine glass
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,id say things like just cause or assassins creed. third person games that feel like theyre written as action movies. pretty much anything from naughty dog.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,that would basically half the entire video game population cuz almost all video games show some level of action

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i just find fps boring tbh.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i really want to like to fps. i just really dont.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,same here!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,same
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,nah there are so many games that are classified into action that its irreplaceable. the fps genre doesnt exist outside the action genre and a lot of rpgs and strategy games fall into it as well. id have to toss fps
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,the salty fan base too
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,and absolutely ruined by cheaters.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i wouldn't be so quick, because while there is the generic shit that u see in the surface, once u look closely there are a lot of unique hidden gemsout something not so hidden like with doom eternal, and ultrakill if your into fast paced shooters, and it ur not into those, i'm sure if u look closely u could find something also unique and interesting in other areas of the genre"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,cries in doom
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"ofc not. fps games are automatically material for squeakyvoiced 12 years old who regularly attend to your mother's sexual needs. meanwhile  bioshock, fear, superhot, metro, half life, stalker, doom, and the list of amazing games goes on. not to mention how call of duty games actually used to be amazing before this bandwagon started rolling. oh, and let's totally forget that fps must have driven technological innovation  to the point of actually pushing the hardware industry forward  more than any other genre. name a modern realtime rendering technique and john carmack probably had something to do with it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,yea we know.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"we do, but other opinions are better"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,this is sacrifice i'm willing to make
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i am fully aware of that. not a hater of fps, but i kinda feel bad because i have some extreme motion sickness and that makes me physically unable to last playing fps games. so yeah, to me, fps has to go"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,mobas should stay for as long as they can. we don't want the toxic lol community in our online games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i feel this. strategy takes a lot of brains which i don't enjoy in games. i'd rather have small mind play and a lot of shooting heads.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"yeah, that's how i feel the others are just more enjoyable for me"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"same, and it always seems crazy to me that there are people who will just entirely rule out a genre because of one bad experience. that is why i picked action, because action is often included in rpg and fps anyway so i'm not losing any variety by letting that one go"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"idk man, titan fall 2 is one of my favorite games of all time"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,what about all the vr games that have guns

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,good thing character action games still exist
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,prob just suck
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"the funny thing here is that people bash fps games for being repackaged and reheated yesterday's dinner, but pretty much the same thing has been happening with rpgs for an even longer time. i hear rpg, and my mind immediately jumps to magic, sorcery, dragons, inventory management and character builds. occasionally it's the same formula, but in space. sure, some games break the mold, but not nearly enough to justify the hypocrisy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,not everything is doom
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,what about action? can't think of any relevant games with action as their main genre. most of them fall under rpg or fps primarily e.g. gta or doom. maybe just cause is action but i don't think that's worth keeping over the other three genres. genuinely interested which games you're thinking of.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"you want halo... doom, cod, and literally half the modern popular games to go?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"your forgetting all the older gems or singleplayer only games like metro, doom, far cry, fallout and elder scrolls"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"oh yea, tons of people in their 60s and 70s. eyeroll"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"it's a genre as it limits what you would be doing normally, in favor of a fun pace. i cant really think of an fps that wouldnt be considered an action game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"yeah really surprised most people here vote for fps. even survivalgames such as dayz, minecraft or something like no man's sky feels much more immersive to me if played in first person. also played red dead 2 fully in first person and after apex standardized first person in battle royale i don't want to go back to third person fortnite or pubg."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,but you realize that fps isn't just limited to online shooters right?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"this just in, fps games are terrible when you judge them as if they were a singleplayer story game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"so, goodbye to the original 2 fallout games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,all fps aren't multiplayer online competitive games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"lol, people downvoting me for giving an opinion when i was asked. sad"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,alright here's two games just cause fallout 12 and this is the result assassins' creed pre 3 do you understand now?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,ask to choose one someone chooses one gets downvoted love this website
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"hey now, no fps means no doomwolfenstein, and we cant have that."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i feel like that only applies to fps games with multiplayer as their main focus and story as the side focus or no focus at all. and i really dont think theres a problem with that when theres games that dont do that. doom, far cry, fallout, halflife, and metro come to mind as fps games with great stories and good length. and im counting portal as fps, and ill die on that hill. you have a gun that makes holes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"skyrim, oblivion, witcher 2 and 3, fallout 1,2,3 and new vegas, divinity original sin 2, disco elysium, diablo, all souls games. those are the just off the top of my head."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,looks like enough of us chanted 'woololooo' at just the right time
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"it's because fps is the most narrow genre by far. strategy is an entire encompassing genre that has tactical strategy, grand strategy, realtime strategy, puzzle strategy, card strategy etc... fps by comparison is a subgrenre firstperson of a subgenre shooter, and while there's many phenomenal fps games, the overall loss would be lesser. there would still at least be other shooters, as well as other firstperson games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,fps is just action where you cant see yourself. its the most redundant option here.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i think there is a stigma for those who play fps and the rest of the genres. most fps are shells of there former self and a part of fps is to lose a lot... mostly out of your control so it becomes a very toxic environment where were not just mad at everyone in the lobby but any gamer that just plays action games aren't good enough to play fps. on the opposite side sits a bunch of gamers with different interests and lack of time who would generlize most fps gamers as toxic. my point, i think that's why fps is on the count block"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i think a lot of reddit just has a weird hate for fps games

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i also think that we should put a difference between single player fps games and multiplayer fps games. cause multiplayer games can be always pretty toxic but i would honestly say that some singleplayer fps games have easily one of my favorite campaigns and i would also argue, a few of the best stories star wars republic commando, halo reach, halo 2, dishonored, bioshock, bioshock infinte, far cry 3, titanfall 2, metro series and doom eternal etc. they all are extremly unique in gameplay and have a complete different way to play them, unlike multiplayer games which are about nothing else but shooting... and... shooting harder... people generalize them here but you could do the same with any other genre. the difference between the mentioned games can be as big as between witcher and ac4. just because they are open world games with swords as weapons, it doesn't mean that they are the same. seriously."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i mean surely you can just do that just slap some skills and just go exloring no? or do you mean you feel pressured that you have to have a min max build otherwise you not going to get far?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"what are those games without the other 3 options? that's kinda the funny think about the 4 options in this post. fps is the most narrowing genre. doom and halo could be action rpgs without much change, there are other ways to have a sci fi shooter without a first person view. so in the grand scope of one of these options has to go we get to keep the most if fps is chopped."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"maybe the meme games such as cod and fortnight not firstperson per se have toxic lobbies, but multiplayer shooters like halo and gears and back 4 blood don't have toxic lobbies, at least in my experience. there's the rare, ugh, my teammates suck but a lot of people don't use their mics. and it's easy to mute players. maybe fighting games have a risk of toxicity. but yes, delightful campaigns, and we also have a renaissance of boomer shooters having ten weapons and health packs littered about such as prodeus."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"almost every online multiplayer game has that element to it because that's human nature when mixed with anonymity. multiplayer games are awesome, but they're awesome when played with friends, in the same room or at a lan party where you can all play and laugh together, giving each other shit in a friendly and funny way. online play with randoms is a cheap substitute where you play vs. human bots, with more randomness to their actions but far more shitty behavior as a side effect. this is the primary reason i don't play online fps or mmo games even though i love plenty of the game concepts. i play games to have fun, and if i can't multiplayer with my friends, i'll rather just play solo. strategy games seems to be somewhat exempt from this rule, because little dumb shits who fucked your mom last night can't just get good at these games by throwing more free time at it, and they seldom have the patience for a full game of civ."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"thats because most sport games are strategy games think the football or basketball or soccer games. those are just types of strategy games, can't define them as action, most of it is controlling multiple characters, developing teams, etc. i bet whoever likes sport games can get into strategy games and vice versa if they get past their prejudices of the theme of play. most racing games would be closer to action, games you control a single character with a lot of andrenaline filled situations requiring your direct input. i think instead of sports we should have included a moba or somethinf category. a mix of action and strategy."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"and it allows you to replay the game over and over, learning new skills you didn't use the last time you played the game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"while ukinokomushroom only mentioned skill trees, menus and item upgrades, i'm gonna use crafting as an example because that is also antithetical to the mindlessly explore and do some cool shit credo. there's a rewardrisk you have to take when utilizing a crafting system in a game. in my experience, all crafting systems builds upon the foundation that your character has an inventory, i.e. what you craft replaces something that you already have for something else. it never adds stuff to what you already have. take witcher 3 for example. you might get a blueprint for an awesome sword early on, but you need materials to craft it. you basically know the stats for the sword, but now you either spend time mindlessly farming the materials which feels like a chore, or you just continue questing until you get what you need by chance. but during that time you'll most likely get newer swords from normal gameplay, diminishing the stat upgrade the sword would have been compare to when you got the blueprint, or you might even have found a better sword along the way, potentially making the time farming wasted effort. in contrast to metroidvanias meaning the og metroidvanias like metroid games, hollow knight, ori, which is my favorite genre and having exploration and doing cool shit as core concepts, there are no such rewardrisks. character upgrades are additive, only making you stronger, often substantially so. you acquire upgrades by stumbling upon them rather than actively working towards getting something. thus there's never a sense of anticipation that gets ruined by disappointment. there's also arguments against skill trees and items and other things, but crafting is my least favorite mechanic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"it just feels so cluttered imo. whenever you kill an enemy or search some location, you get so many different stuff such as items, xp, skill points, upgrade points, ingame currency, crafting recipes, and some documents filled with lore. i feel pressured to go into the menu and read the info about whatever i just picked up or look at the skill tree to see what new skills i can upgrade. also stresses me having to choose which skillupgrade to get next because it feels like having to decide what to purchase next. i just want something simple and straightforward. maybe it's just me who's like that though, a lot of other people might be just fine with these mechanics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i def feel the pressure to do the upgrades right, i feel that if i do not there is going to be a huge time penalty waiting for me further on down the road by having to grind way harder later on because i upgraded the wrong things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i mean, tbh, those two skills are things nobody wants to actually spend time doing for the most part..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"there have been games designed that way. skyrim levels exactly that way where the more you blacksmith, the higher your blacksmith skill goes. the more you use one handed weapons, the higher it goes. the problem is that people end up trying to level by just spamming the same thing over and over and over. you get people crafting tons of daggers, or backstabbing npcs over and over and over. many people find leveling by accomplishing actual tasks, whether that be killing monsters or finishing quests, to be much more satisfying."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i mean, those too, yeah"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i see what you mean but i feel like those are subgenres of action. i do agree that action as a whole is too vague nowadays, as tons of games seem to be actionhybrids of some kind. like fallout 4 is totally an action rpg. like metal gear is stealthaction. but god of war is not an rpg, i gotta draw the line there haha if you wanna get specific gow is fantasy actionadventure."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i agree that most rpgs need to dramatically cut back on the useless shit it throws at you. make loot rarer but more valuablemeaningful. single player rpgs with mmo like loot mechanics is dumb. playing inventory management is just a drag.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,holy shit that skill tree is a full time job.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"agreed, my dude. if you play enough games you can recognize an action game from a fps or rpg pretty easily, typically."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"if there is, im also unaware of it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"basically this. i stopped around season 9 chapter 1, and it didnt take me long to realise that despite all of the minor changes to the map, ive been playing the same game on the same map for a long time. playing with friends is cool but the novelty of that wears off pretty quickly as well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"terrible shooterwise and i personally dislike how combat revolves into build, shoot, build shotgun. the better builder wins 90 percent of the time. different strokes for different folks though."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"its a hardcore shooter, definitely not for everyone, but it scratches an itch like dayz used to, but no zombies. definitely watch some videos and check out the subreddit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,also try doom eternal if you're into high speed and challenging shooters
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,try insurgency 2016. when you get to 3k hours you'll remember that you can shoot from the hip while sprinting. then you get to 4k hours and you're only getting noscope headshots from 200 feet with a pistol. it's a great milsim.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"not really, a game like cs wouldnt stand if its perspective was shifted to 3rd person, it'd invalidate the tactical aspect and allow exactly what i mentioned above. the game would no longer be about skill which is one of its biggest selling points, hence the massive esports background."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"why do people care to have an opionion on things they don't understand. games like apex legends introduced a 3rd person mode and it fucked the game so hard the hard removed that shit in like 2 weeks. tactical shooters will be completely deleted and pretending like the imersion and sense of speed and strenght you get in games like doom can be replicated in 3rd person is absurd. we get it, you don't play much fps games, but if thats the case then don't talk like you know how they work."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,people only think that because they never played a real fps.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,thank you father.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,you get a lot less useless shit in dark souls than most rpgs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,that's certainly true. i don't think shotgun is a bad weapon to have your game focused around though. it's certainly better than ar imho.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"there's no reason that simply being able to peak around corners would eliminate any tactical element to cs. it would change it, and it would need to be adapted to, but it wouldn't even come close to eliminating anything, just changes is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,tell me you have the mental capacity of someone with a lobotomy without saying it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"i play tons of fps games. i prefer first person in pretty much any game where is toggleable too. the problem with apex was implementation, and pretending tactical shooters couldn't continue forward with the new restriction or that doom couldn't be replicated without first person is honestly just insulting the developers. just because you happen to have a disproportionate affection for fps games doesn't mean they've got some eternal monopoly on any of these concepts or designs, just an argument is just ignorant. i'm sorry people see your preferred franchise as more disposable, less unique, try not to take it so personal."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"jesus you need to calm the fuck down with your replies dude. i get it, fps games get you hard and you feel offended, but you don't need to reply to every one of my comments with the exact same outrage. but just out of interest, what real fps have i not been playing? because so far i've played every game mentioned in the replies of people attempting to claim i'm wrong."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,tasted burnt
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"that's cool, it's not for everyone"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,yup. this is why fps is not really that popular. most people aren't going to have the energy to dedicate to a really good shooter. and tbh there's nothing at all wrong with that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,you don't know what you're talking about. it's excruciating. you can die from a single headshot in cs like in many games. if someone was around a corner and they couldn't see you you could strafe around the corner with your crosshair lined up on their head and get instant kills. why do i need to explain this to someone as adamant as you when you're so incontrovertibly wrong?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"elaborate, you are the one here throwing insults without saying anything. if what i said is that stupid it shouldnt be hard to address it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,upvote for use of toggleable
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"fps is not even close to be my favory genre, but nice try making this seem like an emotional argument. i have more hours in a single fighiting game than i do in all fps games i've played combined. you used the word mildly and that i take issue with, i'm not saying doom will get fucking nuked off the planet, but a franchise like that would require a heavy rework. and tactical shooters will never exist in the way they exist today with 3rd person, it will just be a different experience, you can not replicate it in 3rd person."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,i think the war owl pretty much proved how third person in an fps changes the whole game in thishttpsyoutu.beyepntrssslu video
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,you must play a ton of dogshit fps games if you think tps wouldn't ruin many of them. imagine playing insurgency with third person on? how dumb is that? you're just proving the reason why genuinely well crafted fps aren't that popular. they're too difficult for the general public because there's a baseline barrier to entry based on skill.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2021-10-29,"quake live, insurgency 2014, enemy territory. any shooter that maximizes movement and shooting in 3d space. you wouldn't be able to take true fps and turn them into console friendly third person shooters without making them completely unplayable. if you seriously think any fps can be replaced by a tps than you literally never played a good shooter. the genre sucks because developers go very far to appeal to the largest audience in order to make a decent amount of revenue. so you get games like halo cod and cs reskins every few years that barely evolve. now finally after 20 years of shitting up the genre you're getting something like halo infinite which people are saying is lighting fast even though it's still an extremely slow shooter. modern fps are only just now maturing and catching up to where shooters were 20 years ago because the past 20 years were about appealing to people who didn't know to buy an expensive 120hz crt and a mechanical keyboard if they wanted to play a quake 3 and be decent at it. do you understand how many console and cs players i've spoken to who thought you couldn't see more than 60fps?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-10-16,"id like to have a go at making this, do you have any advice? it looks great."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-10-16,"best way i can lay out how i did it got a front opening shadow box measuring 8x10 with an inch in depth. cut and glued thin wooden planks to the sides of the interior of the box, about half an inch in depth. i cut out both the black forefront and dark grey background with an exacto knife and made sure the borders lined up right with the dimensions of the box pretty much just had to eye ball it as i didn't have a ruler. glued the edges of the dark grey layer to the top of the wooden planks on the inside of the box. cut out a layer of transparent paper, glued it down over the opening of the entire box. finally, took the black layer, laid it flat against the glass and glued the edges on the back of the frame, so it wouldn't show on the glass itself, and sealed the entire thing shut. long winded i know, but i hope this helps. kinda hard to walk through the process without a visual aid."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"for the laziest, here's the raw image source on da.httpfc00.deviantart.netfs70i201205892imnothogarthbyichigopaul23d4r3ikg.jpg fucker."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,why the fuck would they want it? what use would it be? they could easily take it without paying for it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,to what end exactly? you aren't going to get upvotes just because you have a lot of karma.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,that second thing there.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,and this affects you... how?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,well admit that it's correct advice then.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,well its not like most games which scream click here for a new adventure although i did feel portal stupid
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,you're not wrong.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,well shit..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"i never said to comment about how great it is, but people who say 'awesome!' and yadayada are saying positive things, giving off positive energy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,honestly i'm disgusted about having to turn on my computer to get here.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,here is a lazyboy httpwww.techstyling.comwpcontentlazyboychair.jpg
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,astroturfing. quasilegal marketing techniques. any number of scams. what could someone do with 1000 high level accounts? drive ad traffic probably.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,are you telling me potatoinmyanus doesn't get lots of upvotes? i think it definitely helps that people will associate a username with good content and being on the front page frequently. it worked on digg.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"short term? not at all. long term? the overall quality of this site is constantly degrading. of course, you'll probably dismiss that to, so i wont bother any further."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"i don't like it. i'd rather we don't encourage such forms of posting, otherwise we end up with more of it. it's that simple. i'd rather have oc than a bot reposting top links. but you don't really want a reason, do you? and my reasons, whatever they may be, will probably be ridiculous to you for whatever reason. so i'm not going to bother explaining past that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"what? i'm just using his own words to get him to back off, i ain't agreeing with it. why would i admit anything of the sort?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-04,you should capitalize your i's.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,i know. we should have some shit that implants images into our brain.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,highlevel accounts are not needed. anybody with the skills to do so could easily create a repost bot.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"if you can show me an example of an account being consistently upvoted to the top with bad content, maybe i would concede that point. nobody looks at the username of the poster, i don't at least."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"you, like all people who complain about reposts, have somehow got the feeling that this website is about you and the things you have seen. it isn't. there are more of us here. a lot of us have never seen this before. it doesn't matter if it's a bot who posts it or not. it doesn't matter. if it gets upvoted, then it is quality content. if you don't like it, there's a tiny little button labeled hide that i assure you is extremely easy to push. or else you can leave. now you might say that i should take my own advice and ignore complainers like you, seeing as how you've been upvoted and all. you would be absolutely correct. i'm trying to do that more often. because i'm realizing what you also need to realize it takes far more effort and time to go on complaining about it than to just hide it and let those who haven't seen it enjoy it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-04,alright i did it are you happy now?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"no, i mean ones past their probation period with verified emails and so on. accounts as far past the spam filters as possible before the spamming starts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"if your posts don't do well regularly, you will be governed like a car engine. you will have to wait to post again. sometimes even days at a time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"goes on to say what he should do doesn't do it i just found that a bit amusing. i don't really want to debate this with you. there's plenty of content we miss every day, and people game the upvoting system all the time. if you like this that's fine, all i'm asking is the reddit populace to discourage reposting to such a degree. i feel like you're excusing it and it's really a negative on the community. if you don't care, then whatever, i'm not here to convince you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"it's not difficult to create a bunch of dummy accounts and then a posting bot. he'd be lucky if someone gave him 10 for the account. in a usermoderated website, where he is likely to be banned from subreddits or have his posts removed as soon as he posts them, it doesn't matter how highlevel his account is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-03,the spam filters of reddit do not take into account the amount of karma that an account has for exactly this reason. lots of karma is only useful for deceiving other users into not suspecting you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,anybody with the skills to do so could easily create a repost bot. did i not just say that? all you do is have it repost popular content.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,says he doesn't want to debate. does.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"no, you did not just say that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-12-02,"you can not want to do something and still do it. but with that note, this is just getting stupid. at least i offer a point."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-12,"why graphic adventures like monkey island, grim fandango etc are under no puzzle zone?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-12,"well it's certainly interesting. someone should really make an update 2023 one, we've had so many new innovative games and also starfield come out since then"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-12,i love that ducktales is the ending for a line! now the song is stuck in my head.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-01-12,"the path to get to wow is literally the complete opposite of the path shown here. the opposite answer for every question is the correct one. and that's just the game i saw first, i can't imagine how bad the rest are"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-22,"not necessarily a dumb name, but any game where the sequel uses all the same exact words, but adds a few more, will be a pain in the ass if you just want the original game. for example, i was recently trying to look up mario bros. which, of course, google assumed i really wanted super mario bros, or a detailed analysis of mario and luigi, or all sorts of other junk. and what can i do? i can't add super, because certainly every article on the game is going to mention that it's the precursor to the rest of the series, if not just say the word super somewhere in the middle of a sentence. so eventually i just manually went to gamefaqs and strategywiki and looked up the game myself. but commonly i see this happen with numbered sequels. so, like, it's not easy to look up the first final fantasy without getting a lot of crap from final fantasy 2, final fantasy 3, etc. and you can't really say final fantasy 1, because nobody called it that back when the game first came out and all the stuff started to get written about it. actually, for another example, that did happen not too long ago when i was trying to look up stuff for tales of the world radiant mythology, in japanese. except the game has two sequels, tales of the world radiant mythology 2 and 3, which had far eclipsed the first one in terms of popularity. and i don't know enough japanese to really specify deeply, and certainly stuff like weapon list and monsters is going to be mentioned by every single game. and somehow i don't think banning the numbers 2 and 3 is going to work well to find pages about an rpg."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,even if you add the developer name  remedy  it'll still sound like you're looking for help fixing your controlscontroller.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-20,and then you type control videogame for ps4 buttons and the results are sales of the game and reviews and everything but the specific thing you wanted.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,then your language gets progressively worse and ends up looking like control button mapping game video game playstation 2019 ps5 game scheme control scheme
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-20,this is a good one because you want to map a controller so google really does not know what you really want

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,i couldn't finish it even though i think it's one of the most well crafted half life type games ever. the house is crazy big and convoluted and the minimap doesn't help much. i do love that the house is designed like an actual cia facility than a linear video game level.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,"i don't think anyone has actually tried any of these. literally every google result is related to the game if you just use control game. i can't remember ever having to look for more than like 5 minutes to find stuff about pretty much any game, unless it genuinely wasn't anywhere on the internet. just find some more info about the game first so you can add that stuff to the search prompt, then go from there. i can't imagine having a problem with any even slightly wellknown game"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,definitely. id probably wait for a sale if i had a second chance but i think its really fun. not winning game of the year or anything but if you typically like ubisoft open world games i think its up there with their best
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,it's even funnier because there's actually a band called simply the band
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,similar feeling i had when trying to find details about a horror movie on the shudder network called porno. if you type in porno movie you are not getting that film.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,i own mw3 and i've never heard this before. thanks for the tip
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,they are written as mwii and mwiii instead of mw2 and mw3 but that certainly doesnt help search results

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,"to be fair, in the case of f.e.a.r itself, it's warner bros who forgot the strengths of monolith before consigning them to the mines of moria. even if wonder woman is a good game, i feel like monolith could still make a great shooter if they were allowed to. and coincidentally, wb is one of a myriad of companies that has forgotten to fear its customers. not the shareholders, mind i'm talking about the people who actually buy their products. if they feared us like they're supposed to, we wouldn't be in this mess."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-12-21,"black  white was a game developed by lionhead studios where you are literally god and can cast miracles spells with mouse gestures simulating fingers drawing runic sigils. you need to inspire awe or fear for worshipers to build up your mana to be able to create miracles. in the first installment, your magical creature is a core part of the gameplay and they can battle the creature of other gods. they can learn specific things like see friendlyenemy'svillagersstructure abcdo xcast y spell. it was precise enough you can potty train the creature if it is okay to eat friendly or enemey villagers as a food source, whether to prefer eating villagersanimalsgrain as their diet, to hunt on its own, whether to poop in fields to fertilize it, just anywhere, or only somewhere away from town, etc. it was precise enough you can train it to the point of being afk and the creature can automate manage and defend the town for you, at least against an ai. on top of that, it can learn miracles from you and only cost them stamina without the need for worshipers. so when you are personally weakened iirc there's a whole campaign level where this in fact happened and lacked the minimal mana and worshipers required to even save yourself, you can count on your creature to bring you back to your former glory. x200b bw2 dropped the emphasis on creature and focused on a rather simple city building with soldiers. iirc they did well in allowing the towns look natural and had great natural curves in road shapes, but the creatures became a very simple goodneutralevilaligned and follows a simple archetype and you can no longer finetune their behavior. it was technologically and graphically a superior game, but lost a lot of its original charm."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"i think that cartoons are in a transitional phase. it's much easier to make a kids cartoon than a family one, but the family ones will get more viewers. so it comes down to whether they want to create a simpler show or potentially make more money. money usually wins in the end. i think that cartoon network will have very few kids only shows in 5 years."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"erm, no. it isn't just nostalgia talking when people judge these shows. rewatch them, they're still enjoyable even today. writers back then had a lot more freedom with what they could produce so there are plenty of jokes in there for adults as well, that you may have missed when you were younger. now, that's not to say that there aren't any good cartoons today. there are plenty today as well, a commonly mentioned one being adventure time. i enjoy cartoons, both new and old. don't insult the shows saying that people enjoy them only out of nostalgia. they are genuinely good shows  httpen.wikipedia.orgwikirugratsawardsandnominations and httpen.wikipedia.orgwikied,eddneddyratingsandrunlengthachievements."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"i'm just tired of people saying cartoons were better in the 90's2000's because if i had no sentimental attachments to a cartoon like ed, edd, and eddy i would think it's awful or stupid just like teenagersadults think cartoons are today. kids will watch pretty much any cartoon and later as grownups they will think it waswill always be the best. we simply outgrow cartoons most people but idealize the nostalgic ones imo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"i think this is actually true. i've noticed over the past 2 years that western animated shows had a jump in quality over all. not all of them of course, but there's a lot of great shit coming out. legend of korra, adventure time, regular show, friendship is magic, young justice, green lantern the animated series, transformers prime, and gravity falls. the how to train your dragon show coming up also looks like its going to be good, as its going to take a darker tone than the other dreamworks shows. sure, some awful stuff is popping up here and there, but a lot of really high quality animated shows are being made! its really refreshing actually and much better than reality tv that is seriously mucking up live action stuff though yes, i do enjoy some reality tv."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"relax, i explained to someone else that most people simply claim their better for nostalgia's sake. i'm pretty confident that most people don't analyze the nuances of cartoons. you do and that's fine but really if you haven't seen 90's kids will get this then you haven't looked on your fb feed. i have rewatched cartoons from my youth and honestly i don't enjoy them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"ah. so how does calvin die? old age, or does he simply stop taking care of himself, and just fade away?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"see, i completely understand that. despite growing up in that era, i still don't really like rewatching e,ee, courage, or johnny bravo unless i have a thick pair of nostalgia goggles on. however, even being 24, i still enjoy watching chowder, adventure time, regular show, and i have a special place in my heart for flapjack despite all of them coming a good portion after the late 90s early 2000 nostalgia bubble. i attribute this to cn realizing probably with the success of adult swim, that there's more money to be made in shows that appeal to a larger audience 1328, rather than the 812 crowd."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"to be fair, cartoons at that time were a lot more organized. the animation styles didn't diverge as much and there were often all sorts of crossovers. i think that the best cartoons of today are better than those of the early 2000's, but there was certainly a cartoon culture that we don't have today. everything is all over the place because animation is becoming more culturally acceptable for adults to watch. there are a lot of cool experiments going on, but nobody's on the same page."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"i understand your points but honestly i'd say evaluating the quality of cartoons is pretty subjective. i don't have much of an idea on adults watching cartoons but for the majority of opinions people simply like to say their old cartoons were better. you, however, have your own criteria which is great since you have more to say than i grew up with them!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"i think it's fair to comment on the quality of entertainment. it's subjective, but it's also easy to tell when a show's writers are talented. i actually do a lot of comedy analysis. here's a blurb i wrote on an adventure time thread adventure time is a progressive kids show that makes a lot of winks to adults. it revamps the common plot structure of children's programming to introduce the idea of complex problems that are not black and white. it also tends to ditch any simple morals by contradicting itself in ways that promote outsidethebox thinking. it's kinda...the kids' show of the future."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"he took out mister boss, crazy cat lady, the homos in the love seat, and the night bracer all by himself when he mistook them for the real knd he got his ass kicked when the real ones came back to their tree houseov"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"hahhahaha, he was the hulk of the series."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"i haven't watched cartoons in a few years but i'm actually separating you from most people i know who say only 90's kids will get thiswatched this. you have specifics where they really don't know why they like one thing over another besides the nostalgia. however, i'd still have to say that typical 512 year olds are not going to put in much thought as to why they like the show either. cartoons are usually simple for simple minds and for the most part miss older demographics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-05,"yeah, i understand that most consumers don't analyze their entertainment like i do, but the demographic for cartoons is quickly changing to be just as watched by the college crowd as children. remember that adult swim, a programming block that almost exclusively plays adult cartoons, is up there with the bestmost popular latenight programming."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,i'm almost through it with my 11yo daughter. it's the first game that ever grabbed her attention so i already got the next one ready and waiting
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,what a lovely game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,good ol limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"simplicity will always beat new graphics, imo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"what game is this? i want to say inside, but apparently that's not the case based off of the comments below."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,art directiongraphical fidelity.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i'm probably in a minority here but i felt that while visually the game was simply sublime, the actual game itself was very underwhelming. it was a major case of style over substance. it didn't wow me and felt it was very short. but that's just me!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i remember my very first time playing it. a friend made me play it. i held right and jumped at the first cliff like it was a mario game. while limbo boy was in mid air my friend was like what are you doing! limbo boy fell on the ground broke his legs and died. ohh... it's not a jump'n'run game! i played through the whole game and still think it has one of the best endings in gaming ever!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,the game in the picture aged horribly
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,still one of the most beautiful looking games ever.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"i agree, look how splinter cell chaos theory multiplayer holds uphttpsyoutu.bedw9p3jfufc?sifsnwrklfv8xlgvc. there was even a recent fan made patch released it's incredible."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,the version on the epic store doesn't play properly on my pc for some reason.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,really straight forward game tho thats why
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"yeah, like those kids in limbo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i'm not touching you, i'm not touching you"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,yes i can believe its 2014 game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,yes i can believe its 2014 game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i can feel the impact of being impaled by that spider just by looking at this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,limbo is one of my all time faves. had it on my xbox 360 back in the day.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,oh man i need to play this again!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,getting through the secret level is still one of my all time best gaming moments.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i played this years ago and stil remember it vividly!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i got stuck pretty early on game. couldnt figure it out and quit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,are you kidding me? i literally just stopped playing a second ago.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"limbo, inside and little nightmares are all unbelievable. the sound designs specifically are unmatched"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,you maybe want to look around...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,nightmares. it screams nightmares.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"beautiful, stunning, majestic. i haven't played the game before, i'm just talking about the picture. is it good?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,wow
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"my god, is that limbo?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"honestly, limbo is easily one of my favorite games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,wrong! this isn't a game. it's a masterpiece of art.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,this post has filled me with determination
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,playdead supposedly is making new game but it has been 8 years since they released inside. would be nice if they provide any news about this new project.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"man i remember the times when the game couldn't launch on my xps, and by now replayed it on tablet billion times already."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i love limbo i first i play it in my galaxy 2 phone it was free in google store
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"no true limbo is actually 14 and a half years old, which means drake will hit on it pretty soon"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i want to see more people talk about little nightmares on this sub, it's like a crazier version of limbo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,because style is far more impactful than realism. just wish that was more common knowledge.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"oh the memories, such a good game. this one and inside have been short, but sweet experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i'm not usually an indie gameplayer, but got this because of a review on ign  a demo that hooked me. gives me chills every time i think about it. an incredible game that proves you don't need amazing graphics etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-13,"inside was just as good although the story was a complete mind fry, but limbo has a special place in my heart"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-13,reminds me of the ori games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-14,"alright, alright, alright"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-15,looks like a ninja arashi game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,inside doesnt hit hard like limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,wait for hd remaster with colors s
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,most indie games never age because they were made for gamers and not money
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,bingo. wind waker  twilight princess
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"limbo, inside, monument valley and stray are some of the few games which i actually like because of this style thing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,agreed. borderlands 1 looks way better now than any of the greybrown realistic shooters of it's time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i don't think that's the issue with aging. lots of highly stylized games aged like garbage parappa the rapper and lots of realistic games aged beautifully myst, donkey kong country, crysis, starcraft. more a matter of sensible art direction and use of the tech.. or it is a matter of gameplay, not visuals being the most important element. nobody thought early 3d games look better than 2d games, no matter their approach. but they did let us explore actual 3d worlds, which was super cool."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"idk about always, i definitely went back to some old games and went damn this looks worse than i remembered"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"have you played their second game, inside?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"imo it has very low replayability value, once you go through the experience there's little to pull you back in i'll compare it to something like super metroid, which i've somehow been playing once a year since 1993"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,they need to make it a rule that the post has to have the name of the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"limbo, you can legitimately buy it for like 12 on sale and its short and great."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,you might be. are you older than twentyfive?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,it is a 10 for me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,shit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"this isn't really true. lots of realistic games aged fantastically well myst, starcraft, crysis. and limbo looks great because it does use highly realistic graphics elements. the blurdepth of field is realistic. the diffuse lighting, ambient occlusion, shadow effects... is realistic lighting. the physics of the mc and obects in the world is highly realistic and needed to solve puzzles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,i just remembered that a few days ago. gonna be an epic game store game tho .
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,guessing youve played cocoon? howd you enjoy it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"inside is quite unsettling, i wonder what she'll think about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"not sure what you mean. limbo made use of advanced graphics for the time. it just baked them in and they weren't realtime. like the depth of field, light  shadow, and physics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,you're close! the game in the image is limbo. the next game from the dev team is inside.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i totally agree with you, i was hooked on the free demo that ends with you getting stuck in the spider web, everything after that point in the game is a massive disappointment, i didnt like the puzzle designs or the lack of horror after act 1."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,you know the version where the main character had a flashlight?httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vmvmkpcbcn4m
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,... and what is it called?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,indie games are still made for money...they still have bills to pay
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,twilight princess is still my favorite zelda. i replay it every year. wind waker just doesn't hit for me even if the visuals have aged better.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,it's also just a much better game. would anyone say skyward swordtp?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"the og of both look really bad. wind waker was on gamecube was a chunky 480p with primitive lightingshadows that now looks like trash when entire scenes are 100 brightness with only stencil and baked shadows. the walls, ground, sea, and links face being flat and featureless.. now it feels like being in cardboard boxes with pictures glues to them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-13,speaking of limbo and inside. playdead its been 8 years release something so i can give you more money.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,loved inside. that was my introduction. very cinematic gameplay. i got really sucked into it and found myself just playing it through. so very rewarding though. did they do anything after inside? i was on the look out for similar andor better games from them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,for me one of the greatest games ever made. a masterpiece in the truest sense.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-13,"bro inside was a whole era for me. one time my buddy and i got some paper and coded out the tones for the !true ending!, and it was an unforgettable payoff. i'm obsessed with that ending now and i replay it whenever i think about it. it's like a certain kind of fear? kind of liminal? the only other time i've felt like that in a game was the !escape pod ending! in stanley parable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"agree. i have never replayed it. i just think back on it fondly and i've been hoping to find something that resonates with me as strongly as this game did when i first played it. i loved it because it was beautifully done, intriguing, and short. i love games that are only like 510 hours of play time. i think this one was even less."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i really liked it but it never really hits the heights of that first level again, the rest of the game was a very solid platformer but the spider was really memorable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"no, 31 haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,where did you read this?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,nope i haven't. not the same vibe from what i've seen. the sense of dread that inside conveys is something i've never seen before in a game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i haven't played it yet, either. hopefully not too bad?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"yeh, i got it day one and completed it in my first sitting and just went... was that it?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,tp is the peak of the traditional 3d zelda games. visually it doesnt stand up quite as well as ww. and isnt quite as iconic as oot. but i honestly believe its the best overall game in the series. best story for sure. solid gameplay. largest and most useful list of dungeon items in the series. best side kick in the series by a wide margin. really cool aesthetic. windwaker aged better visually. oot will always be bigger due to its importance to gaming as a whole. and mm is probably the most unique with its time travel shenanigans. but tp will always be the best overall game when taking all of its parts as a whole.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"the cell shading is nice and i have no problem with that aspect of ww's graphics. however, i just don't like the character designs. i just couldn't get into it because of how wacky the characters looked. so, even if the graphics aged worse, the detail was much better. i also appreciated the characters and story much more."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"if they cut out the beginning tutorial of tp, it would be one of the best games of all time. i think more people would hold it as high as alttp and oot. some of the dungeons in that game were insanely good, it's a shame botw dropped dungeons altogether."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"phantom hourglass also aged nicely, the only one that held my attention."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"i disagree twillight is my favourite zelda. wind waker is a close second though, even if the late game suffers a lot"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"honestly, i think a lot of the ps2 games that were going for a realistic aesthetic actually look better than a lot of ps3 games that did the same. the lack of hardware power, despite being able to push so many more polygons, still forced limitations on the devs that still required them to be creative with their art direction. everything still looks great, just ever so slightly cartoonish, which keeps most of those games from hitting the uncanny valley."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,they are currently working on something right now. one of the lead level designers from inside made his own game called cocoon. cocoon is pretty short but brilliant. absolutely loved it. i think it's on gamepass
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"the little nightmares games are a different dev but scratched the same sort of itch for me, had a blast playing them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,without a single word of spoken dialogue it says 10x more than most games through amazing environmental and background details. truly a masterpiece
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"goddammit, this warrants a holiday playthrough"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,it was a lot of fun but i couldnt finish it. now i am curious if i can be spoiled for the ending? please thank you!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"damn, math aint mathing."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,the feeling of cocoon in a nutshell httpsmedia1.tenor.commlae6lprjveaaaaadfuturamafarnsworth.gifhttpsmedia1.tenor.commlae6lprjveaaaaadfuturamafarnsworth.gif
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2025-01-30,"yeah very true. inside is a genuine masterwork, first and foremost for its atmosphere. i would say its puzzles are brilliantly designed as well and take what would have been a fantastic work of art in its own right and elevate it to the overall masterpiece that it is. that quality in puzzle design is even slightly elevated in cocoon i would argue, but yes its atmosphere and world building isnt as strong, its just not the focus. maybe the other great game to capture the feeling of dread that inside managed might be bloodborne, of course a completely different kind of game. did you get the secret ending of inside? after getting all collectibles?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"it's nothing you haven't seen in limbo, until maybe the end of the game, but now with colors. the atmosphere and gameplay mechanics, however, play a bigger role in the horrific experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"for me, twilight princess was special because it was the last zelda game made by the original zelda team of developers that made ocarina of time, and it felt like a spiritual successor to oot oot was childhood for me and tp was towards the end of my childhood so it was special in that way. objectively, i think oot is the best zelda game ever made as far as technical and cultural impact for video games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"weird, i never really liked it. i always thought it's one of the weakest in the span between oot and botw. never liked skyward sword either but that was because of the forced movement controls."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,my only issue with ww is the lead up to the end where it's obvious they ran out of time and just gated the final boss behind fishing up treasures over the entire map.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"for me, link in ww is the most normal looking boy in the game, so its easy for me to still believe hes a hero. i love that world so so much. but also my suspension of disbelief is stretchier than ops mothers pantyhose."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,okay but were you team edward or jake?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"somerville is more like playdeads other games, from the guy who split off to form his own team. cocoon is more a puzzle game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"cacoon is insanely cool, some of its puzzles are real brain twisters"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,loved these games. excited for the third one coming
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i felt that the first one was a little too outlast and didn't really do it for me. but the second took far more clear inspiration from limbo and inside and was a massive improvement.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-13,it makes you feel vulnerable. that's difficult to do in a video game. masterpiece.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i read 35, i should start learning to read, it might come in handy one day."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,no.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"ah ok, she'll love it then."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,same and they even had the hero of time as a character in tp  he was the undead sword master dude who taught you moves. iirc that was canonically the hero of time from oot.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-14,its definitely got its weak points. the opening takes far too longan issue ss had as well. plus an abundance of chests making finding one less specialmuch like wws litany of sunken treasure. and the graphics havent aged very wellalthough i feel a proper hd remaster would help that quite a bit. the actual aesthetic is still quite good. but overall its a great evolution of the oot formula. story wise its one of the few in the series that makes you actually care about the stakes and characters. thats actually one of ss strengths as well if you can get past the controls and weak opening. gameplay is just a refinement of oot and ww. and they managed to make pretty much every dungeon item fun and useful. something the series has struggled with in the past. taking out a horde of bokoblins with the ball and chain while using the spinner to dodge around feels really good to me. and man. again. the characters. theres a reason midna is one of the most beloved characters in the franchise only behind the main 3 despite only featuring in one game. and several other side characters are quite memorable as well. i just really wish nintendo would release it on the switch 2. would love a modern port of it so much.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,team jedward.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,i'm team i don't know what the heck that means
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,"agreed, cocoon is much more puzzle based. i enjoyed somerville, but it didn't really have that spark that made inside or cocoon feel special to me. but yeah, somerville is closer gameplaywise to inside"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,all good dude it was a nice laugh for me in the morning lol. happens to me when i have no coffee!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,hope she's ok with some slightly creepy imagery. the pig is a bit off
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,yep that aspect was so awesome
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"it's a twilight reference, except it's supposed to be jacob, not jake. vampires edward or werewolves jacob."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,i agree about it missing something cocoon was so addicting i finishing it in one streamsitting. really cool ideas and just kept adding another wrinkle. thinking games are great. way different but this year i played talos prinicple 2 and it was pretty profound and great
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"oh, i only watched the last movie !i believe it's the last one, it's the one were the final battle turned out to be an imaginary one! so i don't know the name of any character"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,i've heard great things about both talos principle games. i should really give them a shot
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"i've never read the books or movies, but my fiancee did back in the day, so i've learned a lot from her. i think the series ends with bella the girl who ends up with edward has her baby eat its way out of her."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-11,you should! start with 1.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,play lorelei and the laser eyes and gorogoa then thank me later

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-12-12,"that's awesome to hear! some of the secrets i still haven't found, it's a dense game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,how did you miss the bear traps? at least the spider is clearly visible.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,the saddest deaths are the falling ones. you just hear a crunching sound and see the two lights that are his eyes vanish.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,haha this is adorable.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,yeah i get that look on the last panel every time i die
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"just because of this, i bought limbo. just so i could see the stabby part."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"how do you get past the part with the box and the water? seriously, i don't get it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,you think that game is creepy? it was a breath of fresh air after playing the hell that amnesia the dark descent was.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i died...if you can die in limbo...quite a few times after being wrapped up in a spider cocoon...it is very creepy but i am quite addicted. a good buy at 10 bucks. if only i could kick the css addiction.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,.....so have you ever played amnesia?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,surprise spiders are the worst spiders. which is moot because there are no good spiders.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-23,"if you start playing limbo and think oww this looks cute then there is something wrong with you. besides, this joke made it to one of top pages last night ."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"i may have to gift it to myself, i finally got a holiday achievement that was bugging me and my reward was a gift copy of limbo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,that boulder came out of nowhere... i went flying like 20 feet... tt
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,it's amazing with the vibrating controller  it's almost like a little shock that comes with the images!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,exact thing happened to me. now i'm onto killer saws
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,rehash.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"yes, this game is trialbydeath, and to get through it you will have to watch that little boy die in so many ways."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,this game was hands down the most emotionally draining experience i've had in gaming.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,this game is ridiculous to play or even watch. me and my bros were super distracted during finals because it went on sale the week before.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"a friend had me play this a couple of days ago to watch how i progressed. i was so intrigued by it that i purchased it for my laptop yesterday. my luck, of course, is that i don't have shader model 3.0 and cannot, therefore, play the game. christmas just got depressing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"alright, i'm sorry for jacking this thread, but i feel like i've played a free version of this game before. it was online and had the exact same graphics style, but i didn't have to pay for it? was it a prequel or was this once free to play?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,still not as terrifying as that one castle game i can't finish.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"if you look anything like you do in that picture, you're fucking adorable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,lesbian gamers
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i have been playing a bit or arkham city while hanging out with the family for christmas. i must say penguins museum can go f itself. first the t rexspoiler made me piss myself then tinyspoiler made me drop my controller!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i think you have a tumor...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"you look cute, i better check if you even posted on gw"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"and the moral of the story is whoever made that comic is easily frightened by basic black models of what may resemble something more gruesome were they depicted with color. what i'm trying to say is, stay away from amnesia or you'll shit your pants and bleed blood, you fag pussy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"yeah, but the third strike catches you unaware"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,the first bear trap nearly gave me a heart attack!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i think the worst ones are when you're slowly crushed by a weight on a pulley. you bend over into a praying position as you get crunched...o.o
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,or the child hanging himself...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"disturbing? after all of the terror that that thing puts you through drawing that fucker into a trap, yanking it's last leg off after it tries to attack you again 32323232, and rolling it's helpless body into a spike pitspoiler was one of the single most satisfying things in recent gaming history."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,that sound is great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,the squish when you drop the main body into the pit of spikes is also quite disturbingspoiler
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"when you have to roll it right afterwords i was skeptical! i'm sitting there thinking, but it still has fangs!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,go back to rwtfrwtf
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i get that look on the last panel everytime i go to rwtf
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,the way it aims its leg before it stabs is so super creepy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-17,"i got this game in the same manner on a whim after someone said in this threadhttpen.reddit.comrvideoscommentsps4n7nightsnowboardinginanledcoveredsuit that the game resembled that video. i googled the game, saw a single screenshot, and instantly went on to get it without a second thought. as a nongamer, this game is the best form of entertainment i've enjoyed in a long time. pure gold. it felt like watching a movie. and the end is mindblowingly beautiful."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"i spent a good hour trying to float across the water with it, until i gave up and googled it. i felt extremely stupid."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"drag it back, you'll see"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,hold control and drag the box back. you can take it back to a branch you can climb up i think
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,don't feel bad  i tried to use momentum to float across on top of the box for a good 1520 minutes before i discovered the solution. that was one of the more frustrating puzzles. overall it was a great game  i'd definitely play more levels if they were released.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,if you're already gonna ask  might as well just look on youtube for solutions.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"i'm a person who can't play halflife 2, because it's too scary. you can only imagine how i played amnesia. hint i kinda didn't."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"hah, my friend and i went to this after finishing amnesia at a 7 pantaloons were shat. definitely was a breath of fresh air."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i got it for a fourth of that. boy i love steam sales. great game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i kicked the css addiction after they ruined the game with the major patch several years ago...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,me and a friend played through amnesia and then got limbo and coop'd it pass the controller when you die and laughed the whole way through.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,spider bro begs to differ.httppics.blameitonthevoices.com022011spiderbro.jpg
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"if you start playing limbo and think oww this looks cute early limbo looks kindof cute in a phantasmagoric way. then you encounter the first bear trap, the giant spider, the spike pits, you realize you can't swim and miserably drown, the dismembered children and the live ones, which are worse and you find out these fucking parasites of shit which stick into your brain."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"you kill the spider slowly for half the game, and then it gets very difficult with elaborate puzzles  no room for simple action combat there."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-17,the game as a whole was perfection for me but it was the ending that just stabbed me right in the heart. so beautiful.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"the entire game is amazing, it starts getting really interesting when you start messing with gravity and chainsaws xd"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,have you tried the url in the last panel of the comic?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,that depends. do you live in america?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-17,what'll haunt me is how short it was ... the best game i've played in my entire life is also the shortest. not fair. and playdead's second game is still 3 years away ... i can't wait that long.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-27,"2.25 during the stream sale. totally worth it. depends on the person. i just finished every achievement, and found numerous problems. namely, the game is too easy. limbo, while it has an excellent atmosphere, has very poor game design for the following reasons  no closure.  no replayability.  too repetitive, frustrating gameplay because your timing is not within the 5 ms window. it's like the book lord of the flies. completely overrated. i tell my friends that, like mirror's edge, you have more fun watching the walkthrough on youtube, sadly. it will save you the frustration of dieing. over. and over. again. cool atmosphere, just poor game mechanics. oh well, least i only wasted 1 day on it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,limbo is emotionally draining? that's cute. guy who beat amnesia
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"not at all. this game was snatched up by microsoft right after first gameplay and released it only on xbox 360 for over a year, only recently quietly ps3 and pc versions came out. it has too elaborate graphics to run online."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,that one castle game?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"one of the most satisfying things in that game to me was getting past the giant mosquito thing and ripping it's leg off. the music was just so amazing, it made what i did seem beautiful, not disgusting. spoiler"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,but i only just got out
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,nothing on rwtfrwtf is weird anymore.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i shall go try this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,that was one of the more frustrating puzzles. i have far more trouble with the gravity ones. still stuck at the second gravity puzzle and i think i'll have to rely on the internets
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i found the whole of amnesia to be about as scary as ravenholm.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i wouldn't dare to paly amnesia when high.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,major patch several years ago you mean when they released counter strike source? p
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,moot links to greentext story nicely done

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-25,want a cookie?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-25,amnesia
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-25,shitty comics that say that limbo is horrific and comparable to amnesia? that's my guess... based on empiric evidence.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,you were playing limbo with your kid? sure that's a good idea?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-25,yaaaay my favorite fighter being referenced
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"i'll admit, this is one of the first games where i'm required to drag a dead childs body out of a river, and then push into a pit of spikes so i can cross over itspoiler"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,it's not a dummy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,no come baaaaaaaaack stop joebro you criminal scum the dark brotherhood have come for your life
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-25,"granted, it is in general more tame, but if you scroll enough theres still plenty of stuff that is wtfworthy"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i don't think i had to resort to the internet for any of the puzzles. i believe there were more difficult puzzles than the box and water one but i had the aha! moment sooner with them. a few of them required timing when the world starts spinning and i died more frequently on those ones. but the water one was the most frustrating for me because i kept trying the wrong solution for so long. my only real complaint about this game is that it was unfortunately short. i would have preferred another hour of game play at the least. i think i paid 15 for it and although it is one of my favorite games of this year i feel it should only have been 510. if he publishes a sequel i will definitely pay for it again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"well, i've managed to get about 4 rooms into ravenholm over two weeks. i think i might try another room soon."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"seriously? either ravenholm was way too scary for you, or amnesia didn't affect you at all. i'm guessing the latter. i was scared by ravenholm when i was 14, now it's a sunny walk in the park. amnesia though... it's just scary."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"you know, when watching the trailer for the game, i had no idea it was going to be that violent andor scary. it just looks like a stylistic plat former, but the puzzle element adds many a gruesome deaths."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,haha. yeah. what did you do as a kid? live in a church?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i just realised nothing about that part seemed odd to me as i played through it. i might have problems.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"yeah, it is. i played this level a few hours ago and made the same observation. if you look closely, you can see that the legs are basically planks tied to each other and not humanlike such as the rest of the characters."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"as far as i'm concerned, ravenholm and amnesia both had a really creepy atmosphere and a few somewhatunsettling bits, but never really crossed the threshold into actually frightening."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,plat former.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,played that part last night. dummy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i think you guys wish it was a dummy. it wasn't a dummy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,"amnesia was 97 creepy, and 3 terrifyingrunforyourlife frightening. most of the game was atmospheric build up. getting you on the edge of your seat before they sent anything horrible your way."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i think you just overreacted like 1000 times more than anybody either expected or cared. i don't care that much to get you so worked up over something and to tell me that i'm calling people insane. honestly you need to chill the fuck out. somebody is wrong on the internet. holy shit dude.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2011-12-24,i'd say the same back if you weren't being a condescending prick about this entire ordeal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,"having never played this game, i don't understand, care to explain ?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,play inside. that game is terrific from start to beginning. my game of the year for sure.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"so weird, that's exactly what i did"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,this game is very satisfying when you get through puzzles. i love this game. bought it twice.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i did myself an injustice and actually stopped halfway through
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i stopped because i got stuck
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i'm afraid to get inside because of this exact reason. the game is good enough but i got bored halfway through because it's just obscure puzzles with a vague plot. does inside improve on this at all or is it essentially the same thing?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i actually stopped just before the final puzzle before i didn't play it for a year. imagine my surprise when i came back and only played 10 minutes to completion.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i got stuck a ways in and couldn't figure out what to do next. gonna have to pick it up again soon.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,there's a steam awards category for ya
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,that's..........so true.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,so true !
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i got as far as the boxes and the belts, and i just couldn't face dying again and again the factory i think it was."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"this game is awesome, if you left it unfinished, well might as well consider finishing it now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"what? halfway through is when the spiders stop! i think, it's been a while"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,got through the game in a couple of hours. then end is pretty cool
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i played most of it, like 3hrs or something and then got stuck at a puzzle and never picked it up again d"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-04,i enjoyed it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,fallout is not a game to be played near a window cos you might fallout.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i beat it in 3 tries, noobs"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,"heres one definition of limbo an uncertain period of awaiting a decision or resolution an intermediate state or condition. the fate of the contras is now in limbo synonyms in abeyance, unattended to, unfinished it's just a joke."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,there is a pretty dark twist halfway thru the game. don't want to say more without ruining the fun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"not op, but for me the last half of the game just wasn't as good as the first half."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"joke on the definition of limbo, or maybe the lack of story"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,probably because of the giant spider in the game. so many people hates it. i do not think it is related to the plot. edit so much hate...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,from start to beginning  damn that's brutal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"yeah, but only until you exit the game. then it's just shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,one of my favorites
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,as a big fan of limbo i don't get the hype for inside. maybe my expectations were too high. it could also be that it felt too easy in comparison to limbo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i like how it starts off as a kind of vaguely nightmarish sidescroller, gets more nightmarish as it progresses, and then essentially turns into a tool video."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"yeah i got stuck at the part where you can turn gravity on or off i think with the floating boxes. i loved what i played, just never finished twice! on my ps3 and ipad."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,me too. i was kinda enjoying it spooky spider at the beginning was terrifying but then fizzled out a bit with all the water puzzles.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,same. i really want to finish limbo and get inside or outside...whatever it's called. it was even on sale for 9.99 this week and i wouldn't buy it because i just can't finish this game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,"i love chipotle so much, that i poop it out twice"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i never got into limbo, the aesthetic, the controls, the puzzles, nothing grabbed me, i only ever got about a third of the way through. i loved inside! it is high on my goty list. it has one or two annoying puzzles, but that was more down to me than the game. it is short, but for a game without dialogue, it spins an intriguing yarn in your head. very memorable."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i thought inside was absolutely amazing
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"opposed to the others here, i loved limbo, but hated inside. i managed to beat it in 3 hours on my first run and the story made less sense than limbo. the only thing that was good about inside was the puzzles were well done and enjoyable, but not nearly enough of them again, 3 hours. also i wasn't a fan of the ending sequence."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i just watched a lets play and i was figuring out the puzzles before they did. i'd say its easier than limbo but still a very very vague plot.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,the game also kinda sucks at the halfway point.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,so is what you're saying is the game is unfinished. s
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i thought the darkest twist was at the very end.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i played through the whole game and dont remember any twist halfway through.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"if you post spoilers, people downvote you so your comment gets buried. not hate, just trying to hide spoilers, and tell you they're not welcome."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"lmao, i actually meant to say from start to end. oh wells."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,then it's not inside anymore?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,you must have played it wrong. joke
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"it was probably the fact it was at most 4 hours longs, and that's being gracious. i fucked around a lot in it looking for shit, seeing what it looks like to die etc.. and completed it in 3 hours."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,upvoted you because you shouldn't be downvoted for disagreeing with some people.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"you should finish it, if you're at the gravity part you're very close to the end and the ending is pretty beautiful."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i was about 30 seconds away from walking away from the game at that point boxes and the ramp thing and then i beat the puzzle. the boxes have to be in an almost pixel perfect spot. like the other commenter said, you are super close to the end. try to finish it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,hey me too! i guess it just got kinda boring and didn't hold my interest
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-31,make sure you get chipotleaway. it is important
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,is there a story element or just puzzles tho?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,it doesn't. it's a great indie game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i agree. the forest bit was great. fantastic atmosphere, and then that spider. when you get into the factorybit though it loses a lot of that charm. while it's still ominous and dark, it starts becoming more of a generic puzzle platformer then."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,no..it's a pun on the def of limbo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i'm pretty sure the darkest twist is the entire damn game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-04,it is not a spoiler i believe but no problem. it is okay to get some down votes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"yes, that's one of the jokes."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"there's a story, but there's a lot left to the imagination, i thought it was really interesting."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,frustrating as fuck at times though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,agreed. it needed more spookiness to keep the vibes going
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"no. you're striving the entire game. in getting to the end, the child loses. but you actually have to think about the ending instead of just enjoying your success at the game to realize that. the win for the player is the loss for the character.  i fixed the spelling."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,very dark....very very dark...except those beady little eyes...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-04,"you might not think so, but most people would probably consider that a spoiler."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,removed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,loses why don't people know this? edit op has since fixed his comment.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"see, i always thought the implication was that the kids were dead to begin with, and it was literally you travelling through limbo after death to determine whether you're stuck there, go to hell, or go to heaven, with completing the game being escaping to heaven and getting killed without restarting leaving you in hell.spoiler then again, i'm not up on my christian mythology, so i may have been reading too much into it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"httpsyoutu.be2kgzz89mhq?t95 observe. you get to the end. now you have a helper. say you keep playing. what do you do next? you've found your sister, but you can no longer move to the right, and the ladder is out of reach without one of you at the bottom to boost the other up. if you keep watching the end of the credits, it comes back to the same scene with a broken ladder and a dead body at the bottom of it. maybe someone escaped, but certainly not both."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i know it. i got it wrong because i did a bunch of presubmit editing trying to clarify the difference between the player and the character. to lose  both have one o. too loose  both have two o's. i always found that the easiest way to remember.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,httpswww.reddit.comrgamingcomments5lbqy7wheninlimbodbvhkd7 no mythology needed. just observing the state at the end of the game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"i just watched this and the only thing i see is the last rung of the ladder hanging off the end, not a body"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i don't see a dead body.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,i like the sneaky edit
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"if you turn on the annotations, it points out the flies circling the decidedly nongrassy lump at the bottom, neither of which were there when the credits started. a bit hard to see on youtube, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"there are flies circling at the bottom that weren't there before the credits. it might be a bit hard to see in youtube, but there's an annotation pointing them out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"sorry. you're right. i should have said, since you were specifically commenting on what i went and fixed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-01,"ah, ok. wouldn't have caught that otherwise, thanks."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"hello! i'm the oneman developer, inasa. all the criticsm is really helpful and i am aware of the emptiness and boring gameplay. it's a work in progress and i didn't plan for everyone to suddenly find my project. i had 100 followers on twitter 3 days ago to put the suddenness into context. game dev is a small hobby of mine plus i'm still a full time college student studying illustration so i really hoped that people found the project in a more finished state. hope you are interested in the development! follow me on twitterhttpstwitter.cominasafujio i don't have anything else setup!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"not too much more info other than the title, it is called inaka project for now and is still in early development so no release date or platforms announced. no website or anything so the only place for updates at the moment is on the developer's twitter inasafujiohttpstwitter.cominasafujio not my game, came across it on twitter after their tweet sort of went viral."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"pff, the gaming world is too maildominated as it is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"the first seconds of the video like rise and shine, mr. freeman."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,how can i prevent forgetting about this in a couple minutes and actually keep up with more news about releasedemovideos?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i lived in iwakuni for years and would take the local train to small villages in the middle of nowhere for fun. grab a 6 pack of chuhi beers and just wonder around for hours. it looks exactly like this. gunna have to follow this one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i'm getting impression that this game will be a lot like firewatch but with more things to do and places to explore. and it sounds awesome.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,can't wait for the totoro dlc
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,this is why i hate video games. it appeals to the mail fantasy.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"me, playing video games, circa 1999 i wanna be a wizard or a ninja or a vampire on a journey of vengeance! x200b me, playing video games, circa 2019 i'd just like to be a mailman."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,this makes me want an entire vr game that is very realistic that sole purpose is to teach you how to usenavigate the japanese transit system. maybe even have it teach you the basic words you need to understand.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"there's definitely a market for this type of project. for instance  my dad plays gta 5. he's never shot a weapon ingame. doesn't do any of the things the game was meant for. all he does is explore. he's old, is at the early stages of dementia, and gave up driving a while ago. he no longer travels, due to health reasons, but he enjoys exploring a virtual world based on a real location. he drives carefully in gta. he obeys every traffic light and sign. he doesn't crash into people. sometimes the ai crashes in to him, but he understands that he's not playing the game as intended so brushes it off. he explores. he takes pictures. he eavesdrops on the conversations of the npc's around him... he doesn't do any missions, etc. and holy shit does he enjoy it. with a little more world building and populating it  this could fill a great niche. excellent work!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i love simple concept games, especially when done well. i hope development stays on track and we see it released soon!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,nice to meet you upickledseacat

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,probably not a game for me since i'm already living in the inaka .... though i gotta say it's nice to see a game that takes place in contemporary japan and not in the tokyo metropolitan area lol.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i thought this was vr and got so excited
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,the scenery is giving me your name vibes.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,postal 4 takes the series in a very different direction
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,inaka means country side or rural area in japanese for those wondering.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"the art style reminds me of jalopy somewhat, but far more than just that. hopefully this game will be half as fun as the monotonous fun of jalopy, so i can put plenty of hours in it. now what would be really neat is if it subtly taught you words and phrases in japanese. slowly over time going from english dialog with the people you interact with to japanese while having some kind of reference key in case it doesn't fully click quite yet."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"looks good, now make the whole earth."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"looks great even from the little bit available. if you set up an, behind the scenes showing the progress on a site or email updates, i would follow it. not sure where you plan to take it but makes me think of a miyazaki movie theme. would love to be able to walk through the various worlds and locations to interact with characters porco  calcifer! from his stories!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i recently studied abroad in japan for 6 months and one of my favorite things to do was just walk around and explore. seeing acouple if these scenes literally brought tears yo my eyes because of how similar they are to the real thing. i am very excited for this game and hope you finish it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,can you make a mod when you're done to make your game's setting a different fantasy world from the isekai genre of anime? maybe do multiple mods like a ghibli mod and a mecha world mod and a magical world mod and a post apocolyptic world mod. they could be dlc and could have different stories. you could try to partner with corporations without selling the rights to the base game!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,whats next? a game about being an acocuntant?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-02,"postman pat, lost in japan."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-02,"best of luck, dude. i could see this turning into a lot of people's chill game like euro truck simulator. take your time, don't release it before it's ready, and don't go beyond the scope of your abilities as a small one developer project. do all that and i think you'll have something pretty great."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,it looks great so far! i like the concept very much. even if it ends up becoming a short game it looks like it would be a lot of fun. good luck with your studies and this project!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"keep in mind as you gamify your project that not everything can or even should have a specific gameplay relevant reason for existing. for a game's world to feel real, there has to be stuff there that exists simply for the sake of existing. what i mean is, every inch of your world shouldn't be houses you deliver mail too. make sure some of it is just empty countryside. that makes the world feel organic instead of like a giant theme park. and make sure the player has reasonable, if not full access to this space. let them go rogue and climb mountains if they want. put in local wildlife. real life happens all around us as we complete our daily tasks. this has to happen in games too for them to feel right, and a lot of developers don't seem to understand this."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,don't feel bad! i love this. i lived in japan for about 3 years and i miss it every day. this game works be so relaxing and make me so happy. i wouldn't go into this game expecting excitement. that doesn't seem like what the point is? and that's okay.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i think it's a cool concept personally. don't let anyone get you down, not everything has to be fast paced action packed. sometimes slow and beautiful is just as engaging. i like the idea a lot though keep with it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"hey, i watched the video, and i was wondering what house the player is in near the end. see, as far as i know, postmen aren't supposed to or even allowed to enter houses, so what is going on there? i kid, but i am curious about the reasoning behind a postman entering houses where the spirits and yokai presumably are."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,x200b i'm very interested in playing this. just watching the short video made me so nostalgic for my life in japan. i was in a fairly rural place and miss it so much.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"love this. as a garbage man, if you ever need some solid input, i work for an old school type manual labor garbage company where we ride on the back and hilarity ensues. holler"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"is your landscape based off of kamakura? it reminds me a lot of that town, just from the short clip posted above."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"where are the people and spirit's? world looks beautiful though, very gibli."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i feel like the zenness or meditative quality of this game would make it worth while. the nature sounds the introspection while walking in green spaces. having meaningful connections. i think its beautiful
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i love the idea! i'm a postal clerk myself, so the idea of getting to experience a foreign mail carrier's daily life with some fantasy thrown in sounds great to me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,this looks really cool.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i have a few things to say about this very excitinglooking project! first, the whole interacting with spirits and ykai part is what really drew my attention  i absolutely love the idea of kind of a peaceful world to interact with supernatural creatures. if youre implementing a lot of different ykai, id love to see some more obscure creatures in there, like the little ink stone spirits the suzuri no tamashii, right? i learned about them from gaijin goomba. what if your bikes a tsukumogami though and that gives you the option to go faster? although that wouldnt necessarily be a good thing if the whole point of the game is to take it slow and soak in the sights but one thing i am curious about is the location where the game is set  as well as the kind of scenery well be seeing in the game. obviously there wont be any urban cities or anything, but will there be mountains? shorelines? forests? hot springs? snowy areas? caves with no real apparent purpose in terms of delivering mail, but that you can enter for no other reason than to explore? lastly, and i feel this is the most important one  to me, at least. please, please, please make this available for mac as well as pc. i want to play this game so badly when it comes out, and itd just break my heart if it was locked to one type of computer id have no money to buy. with all that being said, no matter what, im going to be looking forward to this. good luck, and have a wonderful day!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i'm looking forward to playing this. i unfortunately don't have a twitter, but i hope yoi post updates on here as well. what are you thinking about for background music?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,do your own thing! it looks beautiful. i dont know whether you intend it to be more reflective than anything else but im impressed just from that footage and knowing some of your intentions.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i think it looks incredible personally. ill be buying it at release for sure. nice job!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,that seems like an a game for improving japanese skills!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"it might just be the fact that's also set in japan, but so much of the art and scenery reminds me of studio ghibli films the train, spirited away, the roadsneighborhoodhouse, grave of the fireflies and ponyo, the temple, pom poko. like i said, it might just be because it's the same setting, but it's very evocative."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,looks like a perfect game for switch.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"this looks so so so amazing, like my dream game! is it possible to turn off the laggy reddot crosshair though, kinda takes you out of it. and have you got a patreon?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"fantastic game! looks very relaxing, fun and unique. can't wait to give you my monies"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i know it would be incredibly difficult as a one man dev team, but this game looks like it would be so cool in vr. maybe someone will mod it at some point or sony will see this and want it for psvr."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"dude it looks great! i had a flashback to ninnaji and the path leading to it, definitely looking forward to see where you go with it! artwork looks so relaxing, good job"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,please get it to switch. i love japan and these scenery really took me back there. id love to play it on my switch. it looks amazing!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,impressive stuff. keep up the good work!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i want to play it! i went to japan a few years ago and some of the best time was walking around kyoto with no one really around and being able to take everything in
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,get in contact with jared petty. this is a jared petty game if i ever saw one. he would be your biggest advocate.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"well hey if you ever need a voice actor for the game, i'd love to help out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,add vr
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i think would be really cool to see some japanese folk lore in the game like kappas along the river side and what not
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i am very interested in japanese culture and would like to play this game you are currently developing. looks good btw
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"looks lovely! imo the sounds will really make or break this. i can already imagine the cicadas haha. little story.. i was a exchange student to japan once. my host family did not like temples or shrines so i would go out to find them myself. i came across one called jakkoin. i walked abooout 2hrs to get there lol. it was up a mountain. i rarely take selfies but i really liked the place and i was alone so i tried to take one. my foot slipped but my foot found ground. i looked back and saw that my foot slipped onto an small ledge and if it didn't, i would've fallen very far down. i thanked whatever spirit was there for saving me from my own stupidity haha. went back there 6 years after. there is now a solo elevator going up for the elderly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"don't take the criticism wrong. i also think it looks lonely but that's not necessarily a bad thing. the little shot alone gave me a very melancholy feeling, looks and feels really neat. gives me a feeling i normally don't feel in a game and games are all about giving the player different emotions,like joy, anger, frustration or scary. i think you're doing a very good job!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,keep up the great work! this looks like an incredible work of art!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"im honestly so excited to try this game, it looks amazing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,your game is beautiful you obviously have a talent for settings and scenery as well as photography if the video is any indication.  i look forward to seeing what the interaction with people and spirits will be like! good luck!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"hi! i think that ambient sound is extremely important for the atmosphere. make sure you have plenty of long tracks so that repetitions wouldn't be noticable. and splice in some procedural events, like cicada chirpings, bird calls, random insects flying by etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,hey inasa. this idea is freaking awesome and i love it. i love it. keep at it. i'll buy it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,this seems great! what else can we know about the game? how much will it cost? where can we buydownload it when you're done? is there any way we can support you? keep up the good work my dude!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,already looking good so far
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i would buy it 100 times! have you seen goat simulator? its a good example of a fairly simple playful open game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"not going to lie, i'd still pay for an empty game like this just to be able to explore the japanese countryside, as i myself has never seen japan and would like to. hope to see more of this, good work!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"hi, i hope you won't be overwhelmed with people responses. love your game aesthetic, just keep your pace, and avoid from burning out."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i honestly can't tell you how long i've been looking for a game that just lets you bask in its beauty and explore the world around you without fear that something catastrophic is going to happen. just being able to go to a place that doesn't make any demands of me would be amazing. please keep developing this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"seeing the earlier stages can be charming. i would like to support you a bit. no expectations, just free money because i really like the feel of your project and your attitude. do you have something set up for this? edit i saw through your twitter!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"sometimes boring can be cool, reminds me of how amazing firewatch was and it was just a suspenseful walk in the woods"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,what is your plan for this game as far as gameplay is concerned?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,this looks amazing so far and i hope it turns into something even better. i'm joining your patreon and seeing where this goes.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"this looks to be incredibly relaxing, and i cant wait to give the finished product a try. well done my dude, keep at it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i'm extremely happy you got some spotlight,but it's now your reddit obligation to hustle i'm sure we all want to buy this masterpiece when its finished! good luck and godspeed my friend you're doing good"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,just make the player character a stand user. that should liven things up.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"if only we were all that lucky with our interests. congrats on getting all of that attention, the project seems like it will be amazing!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,now make an adult version simular to postal as a mod!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"omg so cool! i hope you have the resources to make it as a vr game, it would be awesome!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"dont listen too much to people wanting more gameplay, do the game you want to make. i really want more games with less gameplay, and i cant be alone. i dont always want challenges, sometimes i just want to explore and chill without having to do shit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"oh i forgot to mention it's also story driven, so it's not just about wandering around a pretty world"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,this would look great in vr
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i spent some time at a homestay program in the countryside near kyoto, and i got immediately nostalgic upon seeing how you've recreated it here. fantastic work!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,yeah i had just fully submerged myself into firewatch and it just ended. the mystery was weak in my opinion too. definitely didnt do the game justice if you ask me.. i could have spent hundreds of hours in that world but havent played it since i finished.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i rode jr trains in osaka and tokyo in 2003 and had no problem getting around. biggest challenge was finding my stop on the fare map so i could get the right ticket. in 2005 i went to nyc and was far more confused than i was in japan. i'm american. after moving to greater nyc for 7 years and riding the trains daily, and visiting japan annually in that time... i still prefer the japanese system, and find it just as rideable as nyc transit."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"oh absolutely, the game has to be welldeveloped for me to play it more than a few times. this is a mail delivery game with npc interactions, so those functions should be especially smooth, plus whatever extra features that follow the npc storylines, if any. i guess that's the other thing, it needs to be a fleshed out game, with some sort of story. if you're delivering mail to a mountain town, how does it differ from interactions found in a seaside town? why are you even delivering mail? why would you want to talk to other people? what's the motivation?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"this game makes me think of firewatch though. the gameplay in firewatch wasn't exceptional by any means, but the story driven aspect of it was."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"emptiness with random easter eggs, makes the emptiness more interesting with minimal effort. there's probably enough popular stories that take place in the countryside that you could toss in a few small references with out needing to expand on them or build them up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"also as much as people love to complain about walking simulators a lot of people, myself included, love them. games don't have to be only action movies. a game can be whatever you want, including just walking around looking at things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"emptyness not necessarily a bad thing, given the context of the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"one thing i'm curious about is if you've considered included abandoned houses or the demographics of the population. when visiting small japanese townsvillages 28pplkm2  i noticed many homes were abandoned, and a vast majority of residents were elderly. i guess the question is, is this more heyday inaka or modern day? modern day is still beautiful but there is a certain bittersweetness in knowing the communities are disappearing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i hope you actually read what i said. the theme park aesthetic is the problem.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,that game has far too much noninteractive shit though. feels like over half the random house and buildings you find arent interactable at all. theres gotta be a good balance of it. when most of the exploring you do leads you to places that just exist and you cant even find a story on why their like that its a little lame.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"yikes, there are better open world games then that. i'm saying this as a diehard zelda fan. i've got tattoos, i've played all the games, i love them but botw could have been a lot better. monsters were monstera, monsterb or monsterc in different colors. there were 4 small dungeons. the shrines were pretty formulaic. the weapons and items were pretty boring. they made a fabulous engine and platform for a game with wonderful graphics, physics, world and mechanics but what they filled it with was lacking. i'd honestly fall in love with and agree with you if the next in the franchise was the exact same game but they spent all their focus on the game story and content."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i preferred it that way compared to the grand conspiracy you normally expect in such games. it played with your expectations without overdoing it or becoming the sole purpose like doki doki.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i agree. right after i got hooked they jumped 45 or so days into the summer and i knew itd be too short.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"sorry i didnt explain it well the big signs will be on the right and left for the two different directions and the major stops, usually near the end of the line, are listed on those big signs. they telks you which platform goes which direction example a train line connects boston and new york. you want to go nyc to someplace in between boston and nyc lets say cambridge as an example. i dont actually know if thats correct geography. youre not sure if you should wait at the platform on the left or right. but you know cambridge is towards boston. the big signs say new york on the left hand side, and boston on the right so you walk up to the right hand side platform going towards boston"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"yeah, and unfortunately this video was completely empty. making lively npcs and writingrecording scripts for them is actually more difficult than making the world they live in. maybe this will actually be a real game that has been fleshed out."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,im a big fan of this concept for games. those little easter eggs that someone can find just because they're checking an area out is almost magical sometimes. not to namedrop but this was a fun part of endearing games like morrowind. only name dropped for reference n figure that its old enough to not be an issue
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i dont know, i kind of appreciate it. its definitely a slow moving game and thats not everyones thing, but as a personal preference i see enough moving parts to stay thoroughly entertained."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,so what do you put above it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,i definitely agree with you. i just don't see why other people find it the most amazing gaming experience when there was hardly a game to be found. just pretty scenery.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"both engines are super strong and you can make pretty much whatever you want in either. both have a good renderer, physics engine, marketplace, a large community, good licensing system for smaller developers, and support for many platforms.  in unity, scripting is done with c which is easy to work with, but requires some coding knowledge. in ue4, you can write a lot of code using blueprints which is a graphic language of connecting nodes  easier for a nonprogrammer. if you require heavier coding, you have to use c which is less user friendly than blueprints or c. unity used to be the easier one to get into due to licensing, but nowadays it's just a matter of preference. unity has a bad reputation because the free license requires showing the unity logo when the game starts so a lot of crap games have that logo, while the good unity games don't show it so people think unity games are bad. some example good unity games are ori and the blind foresthttpwww.hardcoregaming101.netwpcontentuploads201712oriandtheblindforest91100x619.jpg, hollow knighthttpsassets1.ignimgs.com20170919switchhollowknightscreen1415058598434411280w.png, and escape from tarkovhttpwww.makinggames.bizwpcontentuploads201711eft3.jpg. as for ue4, a lot of top notch games are made with it so it doesn't have that image problem."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"yes, i agree. it was just a bit of a let down in the moment. when i found out what was really going on, i couldn't help but feel a little sad that the big adventure and conspiracy i thought i was going through was really just a bunch of paranoid conjecture by the main character, being lead on by some guy in the woods, and that the reality was just him being sad and lonely. in hindsight it definitely makes the story better, but it was a really weird tone shift while in the game. the game just left me feeling kind of empty, without any sense of closure. maybe it's just so profound it's going over my head."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"that was the reveal, yeah, but it's not a very satisfying one after the build up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i'm aware! and i think that the twist fits the theme of the game better looking back on it. i'm just saying after all the buildup and the clues and mysteries all that, the fact that there was no conspiracy and it was all just him trying to make up an adventure to avoid the reality of his own life, it was a bit underwhelming."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-02,"same here, i've never had any problems using their system and i didn't even research how to do it before i showed up at the station. you might need an agent to explain things to you at first, but you quickly figure it out and it's sooooo easy after that, especially with a pasmo or suica card."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,what ucaveman108 said. i'd say elder scrolls instead of skyrim as oblivion beat the hell out of it in terms of freedom to me. id probably add dragon age and maybe mass effect to the list but that could be pushing open world criteria. it is fun to play a game multiple times and each playthrough can be completely different...botw was just more how many shrinesseeds you decided to do and what order of the beasts.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"i wouldnt say the most amazing gaming experience, but a pretty amazing one. the game didnt hold your hand, you to decide what was worth exploring, when, and how. it defiantly captured a strong sense of adventure because of how open ended and up to you everything was."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-03-01,"don't get me wrong, it was a bitchin' game and i'm super excited the path the franchise is taking. it's not the endallbeall best game i've ever played in my life but it's up in the 5 of zelda games for me, which that does get it praise."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"you adjust to the pain, it's not as bad as it's made out to be"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,like anyone is gonna look good in their 80's. a bit of colour won't make a shit of difference.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"something well done from the original resident evil. that game was the turning point for me realizing that games were far more than just games. it changed my outlook on gaming altogether. it was much like playing mario for the first time as a 7 year old. with that said, something from the first super mario brothers would be equally as welcome for the same reason. edit scratch that. if i were to seriously consider getting anything, it would definitely be the star ship from galaga. without a doubt. the others i mentioned would be a very close second."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"i dread seeing the amount of tattoos that our generation has once they're older. i don't ever recall seeing a grandma in my lifetime that's sleeved up. it's going to look quite ridiculous. i know i'll get down voted, and that's fine. comments like mine seem like a good idea in my life right now can be deleted, unlike those tattoos."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,did you just call it an app?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,the company that made this game released another with a similar style not too long ago. it's even better imo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"nope definitely white ink. source having it myself. my brother is a tattooist and has done several of mine with white in them and it looks just like this. even after almost five years. i've seen others done by him with white highlights in them that also look just like this. tattoo ink is far, far better than it once used to be. they have a science to that shit today to make it stay the brightness that it is when it's first applied."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"i tell people that have never had one to super glue a piece of duct tape on to the part of the body they are thinking about getting one, let it set for an hour and slowly peel it off over the course of a couple of hours. this to me is best pain comparison i've yet to think of so far."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,i think that's not what he meant. the tattoo itself won't look good as it ages. there are a lot of grey shades and they will fade over time. the tattoo will eventually turn into a blurry mess.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"yeah i meant the tattoo, its not like i was commenting on her looks... i cant even see her face in this photo so im not sure how you drew that conclusion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,it will look godawful well before she's 80.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"ehh, it's not like old people have attractive skin anyway. the tattoos themselves probably won't look great but seeing a tatted up granny doesn't sound terrible, if anything i'll just think she's an interesting old lady"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,i have vivi and red xiii from final fantasy on my entire bicep. it may look like shit when i'm old but it's not for everyone else. it's for me. it reminds me of my childhood and all the good memories i have.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,well here's the thing. it's not like my body is gonna be wonderful by the time i'm 70 anyways. and when the time comes it's going to be normal to have tattoos when your old.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,i feel sorry for you if images inked onto someone else's skin has such a personal effect on you.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"imagine a girl seeing her grannies wrinkled, faded tramp stamp that says insert here yikes"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,inside was good but i far prefer limbo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,i was quoting the original thread on this tat from 2 years ago.  httpswww.reddit.comrgamingcomments2blkmhimpressivelimboink
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,but the pain honestly fades on an area like the bicep. i got a big vivi from ff9 and red xiii from ff7 and there was only a slight pinching for the first 20 minutes or so then i had to fight sleep because i couldn't feel anything but the buzzing. i feel like this testing like this would just suck. now when i got my velociraptor sherlock holmes on my calve i spent the whole time debating whether should just grip the chair really hard or bite it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,via black magic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,but you got the tattoo to be unique...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"yep and to add to this, who cares man. we all end up the same anyway. live while you can. i'm pretty inked and have no regrets. do i look at some of them and go was that smart? then i'm like fuck it, i'm dead one day anyway. fuck what other people think."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"please, i can only get so erect"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,inside! of what?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"i thought inside was disappointing, personally. i adore limbo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,"like i said that's probably the closest comparison i could find and yes some places are far more painful than others, my bicep was a breeze but my chest was a much different story, right next to the armpit and middle of my chest especially."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-24,nah. guy with tattoos
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-25,the outside!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2016-12-28,by god chest was painful in not just the chest area but i felt like the pressure points right behind my ears were being stabbed. causing my head to ache as well.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-21,"kinda random, but shortly after the avatars were introduced there was a program maybe netflix? it's been a while, i forget where you could sync up with your friends and watch movies together, mystery science theatre style, with the avatars emoting and whatnot. definitely miss the days of groups of online friends watching shitty movies together and chatting during the whole thing. does something like that still exist?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-21,"i was a avid online gamer during the 360 era. had dozens of friends who i could play with no problem. from like 06 to 2011. but after 2011 real life happened, followed by sporadic bouts of homelessness. and because of that i missed most of the xbox one era. after about 2012 it would be almost 5 years before i started gaming again in 2017. but by that time i couldn't find any of my old friends on xbox one. i still had fun, but it clearly wasn't the same. by late 2018 i had to pawn my xbox because financial difficulties reared it's ugly head again. hopefully by the time the new xbox come out i'll be better situated and build up a even better friends list....hopefully."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,yeah crazy to think back on those days. i never had internet but my friends did and i remember like 14 kids in the class would be on at any given time and we all had the same schedule and free time at night. nostalgic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,"when i was a kid i kept telling myself video games are my life! when i'm 55 i'll still be playing video games! i just turned 24 and they just don't do it for me anymore. i thought there'd be a super dramatic event that just tore me away from them but without all those people on, like back in the day, there's really no point least for me."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,the few friends i have left who game just play single player games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-21,they prostituted us to the west.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,"i moved to another country but every weekend my friends from back home and i would meet on xbl and play games for hours. cod4, mw2, gears, halo 3 etc. then slowly they seemed to forget about me. sometimes id show up and they had full lobbies. id wait to play and sometimes they never freed up room. once when i was back home visiting we made plans to hang out but suddenly my friends said theyd be late. the reason was they all took a drive out to one of the shops in another city we had always hung out at and lost the time. they didnt even invite me even though i was free all day waiting for them. they just simply didnt consider me since i hadnt been physically part of the group for so long. it all came to a head when black ops was released. like every game, we planned which game wed buy next to keep up our weekend gaming sessions. i had to buy because you cant rent games in this country. we played once and everything was as usual. then the next weekend i log on to see my my friends playing madden or something. i waited for them to finish but they played all night, continuing to say theyd be done soon. when they were done, they were too tired and going to bed. the same thing happened the next week and the next. finally i asked what was going on. they said they really didnt like black ops. surprising as they loved everything cod thus far. but they insisted that they had no fun at all playing it. this was just before winter holiday so i told them i was planning on traveling to a big city where id be able to sell black ops and get a little cash since it was still new. they said to do it because they were done with the game. i was disappointed but id rather get a little money back than keep a game that id never touch. after the holiday, i got back to my apartment and went on xbl to see if maybe theyd like to play an older game we all had. my friends were all online... playing black ops. i was confused. i sent a message. they said while i was away they decided to try it again and now they realized it was fun. they told me to join them to which i reminded them that they told me to sell the game and i had. they said maybe wed play an old game together later but they were really enjoying black ops and didnt want to stop. i saw them online playing it every weekend for the next few months. i stopped messaging them and eventually we stopped talking at all. i was completely forgotten. i became a nonentity."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,"this is me now. i'm 28 and back in 2010 or so, i would work, come home and game with everyone i had just saw at work. man, we did that so frequently. now, fast forward 9 years later and i switched to pc and kept in contact with two others. one just had a kid and they're never on. the other hasn't been on steam for well over 2 years or so. i feel like either i'm the last of my friends who games, or someone who should just move on from gaming. maybe a mix of both."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,i removed a ton of people i havent played any games with in a long time. most were last from mw2 and bf3 days. either were not on any longer or just used xbox for netflix etc. it was kinda cathartic honestly. rather have a small list of gaming people versus 30 watching tv.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,"yeah i cant buy games with the intent of playing with friends anymore. too many moment likes this, and im talking about friends i still see, still talk too, and still game with regularly. they just cant seem to make up their minds. they told me to get the division and we played one night, then they were always on, id invite and jump in their lobby, then they would kick me or something. then the other friend, same shit. then i saw them playing with each other, id hop on and they would kick me. said fuck it. sold the game and unfriended them on xbox for the longest time. pretty sure they never even noticed lol."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-21,i never played gears 1 during its prime but i met my a long lasting group of friends i had for three to four years during gears 2. group of adults who weren't full of shit and treated me nicely. most of 'em are gone now but i enjoyed the time i had with them a lot during gears 2  3. i had a different group of 'friends' throughout my halo 3 career. unlike the first part of this comment though i voluntarily dropped contact after they kept acting like asshole children with ridiculously cringey attitudes. we went through legendary together but not much afterward. had to do reach with an entirely new group.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2019-09-22,i put so much of my life into halo 3. i used to tell my gf i was tired and would go to my friends house to play for like 6 hours a night.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"that game, i will admit with no shame or guilt, made me cry like a little girl."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"yes, ive played it to the end, but why would she kill herself?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,does she have a deviantart or anything like that? i am looking for artists for a future card product project.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i stopped going to the stupid site 9gag 4 months ago cause i couldn't handle their rude, dumbass, total antiamerica fanbase. now that i'm a redditor, i noticed something. alot of these posts are about something someones bfgf did or made. andddd, on 9gag it's all about the lonely, grammarless friendzone posts... basically, 9gag is full of friend zoned whiners, while reddit's full of cats, rainbows, and everything else mouthwatering"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,this game gets the babes going.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i did the whole game in one sitting with 5 deaths or less. i'm familiar with it. your girlfriend is a good artist, and she should be happy about it. she also has big tits."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"awesome, yet creepy. exactly like limbo!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"limbo was on sale on steam yesterday it might still be?, so i got it. i must admit, the first 5 minutes of the game freaked me the fuck out... when you first run into those bear traps and it just snaps up out of nowhere i literaly jumped and stood up from my chair for 30 seconds before i sat back down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,i was feeling shitty one day when my friend called me and invited me over to his place to play some games. never have i laughed so much over getting killed..which was alot.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i haven't played limbo, so i will never understand what im looking at."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"limbo was so engrossing, fucking loved that game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"whoa, deep"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"here, have the comma you are missing in the title. ,"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,man. your girlfriend sure seems depressing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,hang on and i will let you know later.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,and if you're not familiar with limbo go buy it now as you're missing out on a great indie puzzle platformer.httpstore.steampowered.comapp48000
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"if there's one thing i dislike on reddit, it's pandering art posts like this one. look at this piece of art my friendbuddysonmomdadgirlfriendboyfriend made. please upvote it! if the art is good, then let it stand on its own. if it has to be propped up with simplistic, manipulative cliches, then it doesn't deserve to be upvoted."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,this game is great! and so is the picture! i like the effect of the ink. everyone who haven't played this game should do it. the history is original and the gameplay is interesting. i recommend it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,are you in need of medical help is my first question?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"but, he is already deadspoiler"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"nope, just graphite and ink."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"yeah, i'd like a girlfriend too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,so amazing it's been posted before.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i don't think she's made anymore based on games, though i'm sure she could. maybe i'll tell her you guys would like some more."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,yes! that is a fantastic idea.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i'm calling this an advertising topic. limbo goes on sale and someone happens to post an anonymous painting about limbo on reddit. inevitably someone else will comment that it's on sale, and even if they don't people will see the game, check steam, see it's on sale and decide to buy it. the user has only been a member for 12 hours."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,impossibru!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,i see what you did there
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,somebody's single!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"can i ask you how else he should have put it? he would lie if he told he made it, and when he doesn't mention who made it people would ask who did anyway."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"in all fairness, he could have painted it with his right hand."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,seriously this shit is annoying as fuck. how is it that every greasy ass acne ridden gamer has a girlfriend who has nothing better to do with her time than make shit for him? seriously reddit shut the fuck up. at least make your lies more convincing and say your friend did it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"seriously i would buy something like this. . . . as for the game, i've never checked it out but i will now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i never understood this. if they did it, they might get more karma in recognition of their efforts, not their ability to nab a talented girlfriend."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,you should try it out. it's on sale on steam and it's super cheap on the xbox 360 marketplace. it's an indie platformer puzzle game. super fun....but super depressing. play at your own risk.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,i'm pretty sure i've played better freeware flash games... that lasted longer. not worth the 2.50 i spent on it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"i didn't know you could get this effect with graphite.. sure looks like watercolor. oh well, in any case it's very well made! i think this is my favourite fan art of limbo so far."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"awesome, has she done anything else like that?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,when? and the source of your information is...?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,great!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"well guys. i hate to say it but my girlfriend did make this. not for me, but because she liked the game. and i'm no greasy ass acne face gamer. i'm a wellkept lady who thought the good folks of rgaming would appreciate this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"she didn't do it for him. she prolly got a creative vibe and started painting. i don't know if you have a creative outlet, but most of the time you just dont churn out shit like on a treadmill. you get an inspirational blast and get to it. her boyfriend then saw the work, appreciated it, and uploaded it to reddit for points. tldr he didn't say make me a painting bitch"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,but internet points!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"the game was good, but sadly not long enough, you'll get through it in less then 34hours. if i remember correctly, it might be even less. its good and full of surprise, i dont know anyone who didnt like it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,recommended. fun puzzles but it's the atmosphere that makes it. makes one good night alone with the lights off and with headphones.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,because the reddit hive mind is more likely to upvote something that a girl made.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,i'm not sure why you're getting down voted so much. i think that you're correct.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,i happily spent somewhere around 8 when limbo first came out. 100 worth it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"these are two others she made. not game related, just selfreflective pieces. httpi.imgur.comn48le.jpg"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,got me too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,didn't you just do the same thing?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"well i am on the internet, after all!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-30,"then people would ask 'who made this?' he'd respond 'my girlfriend' and he'd get as much shit as he does now. conclusion, people should stop whining about it, it's not hurting anyone."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-05-31,that's fantastic still! 0

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"this is actually just a visualization of the depth buffer using reshadehttpsreshade.me and depth3dhttpsgithub.comblueskydefenderdepth3d just to enable the depth map view. you could probably do this with any game that allows depth buffer access ex. games on this listhttpsgithub.comblueskydefenderdepth3dblobmasterreadme.md. the depth map view can be enabled in the shader's settings. your mileage may vary! i would try to play borderlands 2 entirely this way if i wasn't playing through it for the first time. also, i don't think it's possible to play any game entirely in this mode because there are definitely moments when there is no depth buffer ex. menus. edit on a hunch i found out that some awesome people have already made this shader for dark soulshttpswww.reddit.comrdarksoulscomments3ctk65workingonalimbomodbutwithfullguianyone a year ago. also for kicks and giggles i found that this technique works in fallout 4httpsgfycat.compoliticalunfortunategrouper as well. edit 2 here's a comparisonhttpsgfycat.comsentimentalmistyarieltoucan of the effect with and without the depth map view enabled. i disabled the shader during this clip because i was dying edit 3 i found that another awesome redditorhttpswww.reddit.comrborderlands2comments3g6jf9limbolands2borderlands2withlimbomod has done this for borderlands 2 a year ago as well, although their video doesn't seem to exist anymore"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,do you mind telling me how you made this happen? looks super sick and i really want to try running borderlands like this now

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,did i play too much borderlands that i instantly even before the shot of the house recognised it was at tiny tina's place?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,ive played so much borderlands 2 i know exactly where he is and what mission he is doing. its the one where you go find that doctor that drops the infinity gun. if im not mistakened its also the gun he using or just a repeater. the second clip is probably the mission where you have to burn the insects or he is just prancing about the area.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-20,this could easily be released as the hot new indy game and people would have no idea.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"itt i'd play the shit out of this mod that makes the game look legitimately worse. i'm all for a toneshift in the colouring, but this is just removing colours and everyone else pretending it looks nice."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,the game would probably a lot scarier this way if you used something else than the infinity pistol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,so you're just playing it through the reshade depth buffer?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,that looks a lot scarier.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,you can also use depth maps in conjunction with a normal video to add depth of field to videogames in editing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,is there much of a modding scene for the borderlands series?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,this reminds me of that game where you run through the forest as that child and get caught in traps and stuff.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,the infinity is so awesome. gunzerker with two of them and in the gunlust spec and a bee shield did so much damage.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,i heard that borderlands was originally going to have a super realistic look almost like fallout but they decided against it because fallout was already so successful.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,thank you for not referring to the game as celshaded. that's an argument i grew tired of quickly.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,awesome. would be a great mod for left for dead.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"yea, but who uses the infinity"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,wait. what exaclty is this? because you won't get this gradient from dark to light just by removing the colors.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,the part where the dude got lifted in the air looks a lot cooler without the effects.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"the part i didn't like about borderlands was all the backstepping when fighting things. everyone wants to come up and melee you and in order not to get hit, you have to either kill them before they get to you or walk backwards while you load your gun because guns don't have large clips and you suck at getting headshots because the enemies move to erratic and guns don't do that much damage when hitting the body so you waste ammo missing or doing no damage and have to reload. then, the respawns...what? give me at least 6 minutes before respawns. an hour would be good, imo."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,well now i wanna see a dark game given cartoony colors.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,you mean borderlands with just the zbuffer representation?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,not gonna lie that looks absolutely terrifying.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,i think you mean depth buffer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"this should completely change the feel of the game, as if you've only payed 5 for it and it's indie."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,this looks like a zpass depth pass
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"anyone else here ever do the 'evil smasher' glitch? i think that was the most fun i've ever had playing a video game, especially after grinding for so long in that game and being barely able to beat bosses. evil smasher glitch  infinity pistol... so goddamn amazing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,this is a game i didn't even know i needed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,infinity...must not be playing on anything higher than normal.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"i'd play the shit out of this, i'm all for minimalism in shooting games. i flipped my shit the first time i played superhot but that's more of a puzzle fps than a full on fps."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"i tried to get back into this game, but the frame rate and graphics are pretty dated, are there any mods that make it look nicer?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,is this a mod or can you just turn down the saturation and turn up the contrast enough to get this result? i've never looked at the settings.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,can you mess with settings and do this?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,this is a depth matte.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"that's a z pass. passes are buffer images used to make some calculations easier in rendered images. for example, this z pass could be used to calculate atmospheric perspective objects further away fade to the sky color because the little sky particles in front of you start to add up. the whiter the pixel closer to 1,1,1 rgb the more the shading color gets mixed with the sky color. it's called z pass because normally y is the vertical coordinates of a 3d world, the x is the side to side coordinates and z is the depth coordinates. if you have any questions let me know. i'll talk about computer graphics all fucking day"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,whaaaaaaat? do you have a video link of this?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,that's just called a depth pass
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,couldn't you do this with any fps?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,i think you meant to write that they just isolated the depth pass edit yep... you wrote it in the comments. oops
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,im disappointed they decided to go with an action rpg approach with limbo 2.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"i have it running on borderlands 2 now after seeing this post, does anyone have a way to get the hud working again with the limbo effect? its playable without, but for a longplay, itd make life way nicer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"ugh, how ugly. gotta give credit to the designers of borderlands for crafting such an iconic and fun world."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,this looks sick as fuck... is this for the pc only? howd you do it

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,there a way to overlay the hud or menus on top of this? i saw nothing that would help in the settings or file for the shader itself
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-20,fo4 would be fucking terrifying with ghouls.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,i would try to play borderlands 2 entirely this way if i wasn't playing through it for the first time. i envy you so much right now...
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,oh shit doggy wtf!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,the lack of dithering results in some heavy banding and that triggers me greatly. if you know some shader code i suggest adding some noise to the frame prior to color quantization.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"i'll admit, i tried using normal weapons but i kept dying because i couldn't see the crosshairs and reloading felt like it took forever. d i was surprised to find infinite guns in borderlands, i nearly sold the one i got before i realized what it was"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-21,as a gaige player it sucked that i couldn't use this gun.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,to me it kind of looks like the limbo aesthetic applied to a fps.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"tldr if a piece of gear has red text, try it out before scrapping it. i've got around 4000 hours into borderlands 2 and a big piece of advice i can give is that if a piece of gear has some red text flavor text such as in the case of the infinity saying it's closer than you think! no it isn't you should always try it out. red text on a piece of gear means there is some special property to the piece of gear that might need some experimentation or looking up on the wikihttpborderlands.wikia.comwikiborderlandswiki before seeing it's true potential and uses it may have. some unique effects are pretty good such as a pistol that has it's shots split into multiple shots effectively being a shotgun or an smg that has moderately low base damage but does amazing critical hit damage. other effects are not as helpful and some are even detrimental. but that doesn't detract from the fact that red text items have special and unique properties. red text effects can be found on unique weapons blue rarity items that are often given from quests as rewards or drops from bosses and legendaries orange rarity items that can drop from practically anywhere but certain mobs have a higher chance to drop a specific item such as doc mercy dropping the infinity. don't also get too sentimentally attached to your items if you're not at end game level. even if it's a sick legendary that helped you out time and time when you first got it, it's not worth using over a blue or even a green that is a much higher level. once you severely outlevel a gun, it's garbage. alternatively, you can hold onto it and transfer it to a different character for them to use when you start a new playthrough with them. one last thing i can suggest immediately for a first time playthrough is turn on subtitles and if a character starts talking because it was triggered by a mission turnin or progressing in a quest or area, don't do anything else if you can help it. dialogue can easily be overwritten by other dialogue and there is no way to resumeplayback already started dialogue. far too often characters will cut each other off and you could miss out on some of this game's beautifully written script. if you're interested in more details or have any other questions, let me know via comment or pm. i'm always open and happy to share information and guide a new vault hunter."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"they enjoy what i don't enjoy, they just be wrong. how about you give us a run down of what games you've tried it with and we'll judge your list. sound good?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"there are a few different projects out there such as vorpx and vireio that attempt to support vr rendering as broadly as possible on games not built for it. the best supported games use geometry 3d mode meaning they actually convince the game's engine to render the full scene geometry for each eye. the fallback mode that works on almost anything is zbuffer 3d which, as you said, sort of works but has funky artifacts. it winds up looking a little flat as though near objects are cardboard cutouts instead of being fully 3d. generally this effect is not compelling enough to try and actually play the game without a ui, pausing to vomit during cutscenes, etc. but it is pretty cool to see."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"actually, cryengine used to do that for their 3d glasses support. they simply interpolated the missing pieces in screen space. this was done to avoid having to render the whole scene twice. i don't know how the climb handles it right now, the info i have is from a presentation of theirs from around 2010, long before vr was a thing."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"indie  lazycollegekids is a great circlejerk and all, but that's not why you don't fight back in horror games. in survival horror, removing your ability to fight back greatly increases the tension of the game and the environment you find yourself in. most games, all you need to do is aim your biggest weapon at the baddie and click. that removes all sorts of stress and tension, which is great if stress and tension aren't that important to you, or if you can achieve them by other means eg stronger enemies. good horror puts you in a situation where you can't fight back because that's the most terrifying thing of all is being helpless. silent hill and resident evil are both technically horror games, but allowing you to fight back takes away from the helplessness. they're spooky, sure, but not actual horror. outlast, on the other hand, terrified me... biggest reason for that is that i couldn't just bash a trigger button to make the problem go away."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"the flaw with a lot of these games like outlast is the ai though. the first time the generators went out i got chased by a monster. i ended up hiding in a locker, which the monster looked close at it then checked the one right next to it. well the monster walked away and i start walking back only to realize he hadn't made it that far. monster chases me again, i hide in the same locker, monster checks locked right beside me. this happened another two times after that from my impatience. every time i'd run to the very same locker, and every time the monster would just check the one right next to me. i had to quit after that."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,not op but jumpscares are laaaame. thats why i loved alien isolation. so many games and films rely on them to make them scary that the rest of the gamemovie is just 'waiting for inevitable jumpscare simulator'.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"i just don't like horror in general. i love horror movies, but that's more passive. i was on edge the whole time just waiting for something to scare me. constantly looking all around. i was so twitchy. i don't at all enjoy the suspense."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"that is bc you are propably a gamer only and don't understand how much work it actually is to work on a game. im leaving the asset smashed games out of this but making a game is never just the product of pure lazyness. i know where you come from tho, because when just had the experience of playing games you only see the product but not the actual path of the work, which makes it seem so much less than it actually is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"a lot of them are college students just figuring out what they're doing. so it's less about effort put into it and more about experience gained, i'd say. that said, plenty of them are utter crap that should never have seen the light of day."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,have you ever made a game. i've tried. it ain't fucking easy. minimal effort ends up with the sort of thing that is never fucking leaving the biohazard folder on my computer.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,diablo was heavily inspired by other games as well. you can watch the david brevik's postmortem on diablo it is pretty interesting. everything comes from something. granted some are blatant copies versus taking an idea and adding a twist or new flavor.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"and to be fair, god of war wouldn't either, it's one of the most blatant dmc ripoffs out there which is actually the reason i could never personally get into it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,yeah i mean it's fine if there are some elements used to inspire innovative work but when some nonamed chinese company comes in and straight rips off a game almost entirely with no recourse because over there they can do that sort of thing....it gets old fast.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-20,"see, i this always bugged me, the original devil may cry was amazing. deserves some recognition. but now i really do wonder what the first of that genre was, or the family tree. i would say it pulls a lot from games like legacy of kain soul reaver, but with a bit of actionrpg mixed in."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,how is this possible when god of war was released in 2005 but devil may cry was released in 2013?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"this shit kills me. why wasn't god of war called a ninja gaiden clone? ng came out before god of war, and has most of the same ideas behind it as far as the action combat goes. for that matter, castlevania lament of innocence came out in 2003 and, same thing, has most of the same ideas behind it that would go on to make god of war what it was. i'm sure there's more games going back in the years before 2005 that have the same playstyle, but what did god of war do to earn the title of the first actionplatformer with combos?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-20,but i would still have a book with dismembered dogs on it in my house.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"and what part exactly is game breaking because the game worked perfectly fine with it. edit that's plain bullshit especially since there are a tons of real game breaking glitch where you can glitch out of the map and not die, so you're essentially soft locked. i've had a total of 3 happening randomly and 6 others though they had death zone so i could escape"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"not 3 years after release. at that point, it's part of the game and they're removing a feature."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"except the change is linked to your current game quitting would reset it and worst case you either kick the guy or leave. also trivialise the game is by far exaggerating. it doesn't trivialise the game as much as the mechromancer's shield glitch and it's still there. you're almost comparing it to someone bringing obviously edited weapons to one shot everything, which would never happen even now... right? oh yeah actually...."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,and none of that shit is relevant to that specific glitch since all you said can still be done.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,oh okay i understand now. thanks for explaining. to avoid that feeling i like to introduce the game to other people and watch them play it. closest you can get to experiencing it for the first time again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"without the crates it's just, well... running in the dark."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-20,yep. i basically lost immersion at that exact point. box puzzles were artificially difficult and took you out of the atmosphere of the game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,secret ending explains everything.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"i recommend looking up some theory videos. spoilers. my favorite theory is that the current state of the nation is one of fascist regime. under this regime, all sorts of scientific studies can be performed. the government decides to start experimenting with control. in the beginning, you walk through a farm with pigs and such. they were the first test subjects. after that, a facility was built to test the control on humans. the rest is entirely speculative. the large blob at the end that you play as is a hive mind. after the control experiments, the scientists wanted to compound intelligence and control it. i believe that the blobs intelligence is so great hat it actually powers the whole facility's mind control schemes. it is connected to the samesimilar nodes that you interact with to control people in the game. i think that the boy is an experiment as well for security purposes. as with any artificial intelligence, there is the risk that it will want to free itself. i believe that the blob is 1. attempting to free itself by controlling the boy to break into the facility or more probably 2. the boy was placed in the woods by the scientists and the hiveminds task was to free itself as part of an experiment. it's possible that this experiment has happened many times. the facility seems to be falling apart. could it be from the hive mind escaping multiple times? or is it because of the mermaids? we will get to that in a second. near the end of the game you come upon a museum display of the exact mountain and beach you fall down to in the finale. it seems strange that it is there unless it was planned. a final question to answer before we move on. how can the hive mind reach the boy with its mind control from so far away? well, the secret ending gave us the his answer. the nodes that are throughout the game work as modems for the blob. it can control the whole facility through them. when every node is destroyed, the boy turns off. alright so the mermaids and the description of parts of the facility. i think that in attempting to make the hyper intelligent blobhive mind, there were failed experiments. the mermaids are them. so that part of the facility was garrisoned off and only to be accessed in a submarine by certain people. the mermaids caused more destruction around the facility to flood it, so as to navigate. it is clear that the mermaids must stay in the water. orrrrr, the mermaids are part of the security system so that outsiders cannot enter through insecure entrances. i doubt it because building a huge facility then flooding it makes no sense. especially when consider the point of the hive mind is to create intelligence for a post apocalyptic fascist regime. which brings me to my next part of theory. what is up with the shockwaves? alright so there is very little to draw from here. however, i think it likely that some sort of apocalypse happened in that world or nation which eliminated much of the population. the facility was trying to recreate those conditions. orrr, the regime was developing a weapon that used shockwaves. it's a government facility. it's possible multiple studies were being done there. perhaps military as well. alright, well if anybody else has any interesting thoughts please share."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"yea. i don't agree with it either tbh. i mean, following that same logic you could say every fps is a what...wolfenstein clone, or a doom clone. which one came out first?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,"like in your other comments, a gamebreaking glitch doesn't mean it's literally unplayable  it means it's not playing how it is intended. you can cry as much as you want about your definition of it, but you are actually wrong."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2017-01-19,i don't understand your point. critical glitches shouldn't be fixed because there are other hard to prevent exploits out there?

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-08-06,it's pretty fun but sometimes gets annoying cause you will die lots and lots due to the fact you don't know what's coming and literally cannot adjust on the fly. it's mostly pretty easy with a few incredibly difficult puzzles thrown in.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-16,thanks!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-16,that's actually just the colour the shirts come out as when you bleach them
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-16,i'd say go for it! maybe try and add some foreground.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-16,well i use the shirts at work because they're cheap and easy to make. so far i haven't seen one rip. i don't use a lot of bleach either. 5050 blend with water does the trick.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-16,"haha, well if you're an honest redditor you dont wash your clothes anyways."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-16,i just gave it a light spray actually. spray to heavy and it causes the design to bleed past your stencil. lighter sprays usually make the stencil look sharper.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-18,did he molest you or whats the point of this thread?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-18,"last night my 3 year old made me stop playing fable 2 when he woke up, all grumpily demanded that i exit to the xbox main menu, pointed at the games option and made me go through every game i had and he kept pointing at limbo. i started a new game and got up to the spider part without dying. the tv is connected to some speakers with a subwoofer so every time the spider would hit the ground it would make him jump. he wanted me to play the game to walk around in that world, he just doesn't want to know anything about that spider. i had to stop playing the game as i know it gets bad from then on. he's a weird kid, he would play katamari for the xbox but only to walk to the center of the stage where all the cousins dance or to watch the game movies over and over. or he makes me play civilization for arcade just so he can listen to the characters talk in that weird language. loves freakyforms for the 3ds, loves mario. i think he will be an obsessive gamer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-18,that is hauntingly awesome!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-18,"limbo doesn't seem like a very good choice for 'feelgood' art. i've said this before, and i'll say it again, but part of the reason limbo was so good was because of the bleak, hopelessness of everything, which was all accentuated by the bleak, grim art style. adding hugs and flowers and love which i've seen before, not only here just takes all of that away it neuters it. but hey, if he liked it, then more power to you."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-18,"you have a really good point! honestly i was really only going off of the art style, not the story line. i loved the art from the start of the game and wanted to see if i could mirror the silhouettes. but i understand your point of view, i can see how it could be interpreted that way."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-06-17,i disagree.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"absolutely agree, martin stig andersen did such a great job on sound and music in limbo, its a beautiful game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"it's really an awesome experience. the only thing i would change about it is to have more parts like the creepy forest in the beginning. once you get into the more mechanical places, it loses a bit of the scariness and the beauty of the earlier parts. it does add an intense feeling of emptiness and being alone, though. the only things left are machines and you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"my favorite part is how hopeless the whole game feels. every other human you encounter seems terrified of you, and everything else seems like they just want to mindlessly slay things. playing it for too long makes me want to curl up in a little ball under my blanket."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"i bought limbo with no expectations. i had no idea what the game was about, my friend just told me it's a real treat. and, after playing it, it really is a treat! great game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"yes, yes you do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"it's not actually that terrifying of a game. there's a shock factor each time something new pops out of nowhere and kills you, but once you know what to expect there's nothing scary. also, the spider only appears a couple of times and only in the beginning."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,right click  inspect  right click on the node in the code  delete node
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-02-28,"in chrome, you can basically just right click and say inspect elements. you'll get a little window on the bottom that will display the html. when you mouse over a bit in the little window, it will highlight what that is in the main window. then you can just right click  remove node. if you need quick and simple, , you can delete everything in the center portion except the video you will be left with black bars on the side for widescreens, but the other way deleting the objects that are unneeded in the mycontent section will leave the video fit to screen. when you're done, just close the little window. if you screw up or want to see the original, just refresh the page. there's probably a way easier way, but it only takes me about 30 seconds, so it's not a big deal to do, especially when i leave it up most of the day."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"return of the obra dinn. it's a puzzle game where you have a pocket watch that can take you back in time to the moment of someone's death. one day, a ship called the obra dinn set sail and never returned... until today. your job is to go aboard and figure out what happened. it's not enough to just see how they died. you need to find out who each person is, what killed them, and who their killer is, if applicable. not every body is still on the ship, and not every story will be told in the order that it actually happened. you need to use every clue at your disposal to solve the mystery. it's my favorite puzzle game ever, i wish there were more like it. if i had to guess, it was maybe a 3 or 4 hour game? i don't know for sure, but it's definitely less than 10. btw, if you're the type to go for every achievement in a game, i'd recommend looking up the hidden achievements before playing. one of them is kinda... well, dumb. if you don't do it the first time, you'll need to play through the whole game again to get it, and at that point it just feels tedious. but the game itself is still super fun. edit it's made by the same guy who made papers, please, another great game that's probably under 10 hours if i had to guess."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"honestly, roguelikes for the most part might be up your alley. procedurally generated games in essence. typically roguelike runs tend to least up to a couple hours before you either win or lose, then you potentially gain progression to have better cards our a new ship next run. the short run times are perfect because you can pick back up after a long break and not have to remember where you were ftl faster than light is phenomenal. the gameplay is 2d top down space combat. you select areas on your opponent's ship to target with your weapons and you manage the crew inside your ship to tell them what stations to man for certain bonuses, what to repair, what enemy boarding crew needs killing, what fires to put out, etc. peglin is a fun little game that is basically peggle roguelike, fighting enemies by hitting pegs on the board to deal damage, getting better orbs and upgrades, it's fun if that's up your alley. not a roguelike, but fits the vein of i just want to play when i can and not have to remember much about it  deep rock galactic. great game about space dwarves getting sent into a hostile alien planet to extract resources while the buggy denizens try to forcibly evict you. sometimes with explosive bugs, those are fun. but you have guns and explosives of your own to fight back. each of the 4 classes has a suite of guns and tools used to make navigating the caves easier. not going to last them all here, there's a lot, but the game is very fun and is one of my favorites rock and stone. the missions are nice and short, lasting anywhere from 10 minutes if you're lucky to 45 minutes if you're very unlucky. deep progression, lots to do, hard to get bored of it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"all the halo games master chief collection is a great deal. like 5 games in one theyre all great standalone stories, so you dont have to play them all at once. similarly, the call of duty campaigns as well. id stick to the most popular trilogies. mw1, 2 and 3. the originals not 2019, although mw2019 is not bad and world at war, bo1, bo2. unfortunately its way harder to find deals ob these games id wait for steam summer sales. if you like story, id say look into specifically story based games. many of them are short telltale games, and walking simulators are a good place to start."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,highly recommend the game 12 minutes. very unique game that can be completed around 68 hours

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"skyrim and fallout is good. the main story is only a couple hours long, but there's enough side quests to keep you entertained even if you don't have time to play a lot. i usually boot up skyrim, do a few quests, run around tamriel, or try leveling something then go about the rest of my day. also, i suggest getting a miyoo mini plus. it's a handheld emulator that can run up to ps1 and is extremely portable. pretty good if you don't have lots of gaming time it also comes with preloaded emulators and roms. not sure if that's legal, but that's less time setting up and more time playing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i'd actually go a different route. after i started working full time i've completely switched to playing roguelikes like spelunky 2 or the binding of isaac. an average run usually takes about 40 minutes to an hour and it's basically never finished because of their replayability so you can go back to it every day.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,first and only play took me around 5h both combined. was a bit dissapointed with all the hype on reddit about them. but they were fun nevertheless.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i would reccon first playthrough is under 8 hours tbh
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,portal for sure portal 2 could be longer if you get stuck or take time to poke around.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,portal reloaded is really good too. the storys kinda corny but the puzzles are really hard.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,the story is worth it even if you have to play on safe mode.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i gave up at that large sea basin after chapter 3 or 4.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,edith finch is amazing. might not be everyone's cup of tea but the best walking story game out there
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,edith finch always jerks my tears  such a good story
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i found fire watch a bit underwhelming and edith finch a lot terrible. to be fair, i was coming off of outer wilds but walking sims are just not my bag."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i think i remember playing that back when it was a skyrim mod. i mainly remember going how the fuck do i get out of here
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,also available as part of humble bundle this month!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,this game is amazing
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"man, i got stuck super early, at least i think, and didn't want to look anything up, and i just fell off. sucks,because i love it, but i can't figure out how to save the woman in the bathhouse.."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"oh my god i love this game. i played through the first time with internet and found another player. we beat the game together with only chirping. never found out the gamertag of the other person, but we stuck together for the 3 hours it took us. it was a really neat experience. a while later i tried again, only no internet. it was a bit lonely, a different vibe to the game. completely astounded me that a game could change by not having another chirping player to horse around and get through the game together."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i came here to say journey and im glad its been mentioned already a few times. beautiful game ive put over 70 hours in it, just cause every once in a while i have to go back and do it all over again. only takes me about an hour or two each time so ive played a lot of times"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,abzu. same kind of game but underwater
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,"sounds great, will check it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,that is a really cool game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,came to say this. and brownie points for an earnable trophy for completing the whole thing in 2hrs
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i agree, although the full price tag is far too steep for what it is. i just about 100 completed it in 6 hours. that's not worth 30 imo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"if by puzzle you mean am i mentally challenged then yes. otherwise this is a game for people who think pretending your a cat is fun. for me this wasnt event worth being free, waste of time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"second this one. i do have time for both long and short games, but love a good short game i can rock in a weekend or so."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yes! it's about 5 hours long, and absolutely beautiful. imo it is a little overpriced 30 for it's length, but it has a great story  even though you play as a cat, and so you can't actually talk."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-02,"yes but i really dislike the ending. !i just want my kitty to reunite with his friends, and it never happens !"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,glory to artzoka
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,obra dinn by the same creator looks cool too
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"this was gonna be my rec too. just finished it for a second time, i played strictly the story for the plat and it took me about 6 hours."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i dont think its quite as short as op requested, took me about 20 hours, but yeah a good suggestion otherwise. surely can be done in under 10 if you go for the main questline only, but thats kind of a waste imo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i really want to play it, but missed the first one. and i don't want to get spoiled from morales ..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,uncharted 4 did that for me. what an amazing game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"the movie industry has shrank from 20 bill to 2 bill in the same time span the video game industry has went from 2 bill to 200 billion. so i would argue that not only is it on par but it has surpassed it. i upgraded my pc recently, i dont see any up coming reason what so ever to upgrade my tv lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,1 on ftl. great game for short bursts of gaming
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"while we're on ftl, their other game into the breach is absolutely phenomenal. still wish it would come out on consoles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,soooo it's a roguelite.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i really gotta go play some ftl again, one of the few roguelikes that i really enjoy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,but dont you dare pass on the second.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"rc rift apart sub 10h? alan wake 1 i could see, that was a fun quick play, but i must be 10h into rc and i'm maybe 50 through main story. but i suck at platformers, which it's a lot of."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"second this, the main story will take you about 8 hours depending on how fast you can get through it, but thats just the start, or about 40 of the game. then, you have the b sides, c sides, chapter 8, and chapter 9 chapter 9 literally took me almost as long as the whole base game essentially the game itself is short, but if you end up liking it a lot there is so much more optional content you can do"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,metal gear solid games a few hours gameplay and 10 hrs of cut scenes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,dead space is also about 10 hours.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-02,glad to hear someone mention pony island. that was a trip!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i was really surprised by sable, i tried it on gamepass just because of the visual without knowing anything about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"had to scroll way to long to find outer wilds ! i'm in the same boat as op. was playing outer wilds in the late evening after work and it was so calming, wandering into space, exploring,... single greatest game i've played."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i have about 20 hours in the game according to steam. howlongtobeat also has it at 16. 10 hours seems extremely optimistic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,standing here i realise
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,the best 10 euro i have spent on a game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"while i would call hades my favorite game its tough to recommend if he only wants a 10 hour game, took me way longer then that to even beat my first run lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i recommend all these games as well.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,surprised this isn't higher up. i'm very much like op and love short games. just finished the first one and it's dlc. one sitting for main. one more for dlc. would've finished even quicker if it weren't for the long load times when you die.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yeah, but none of it will make any sense if you haven't played the rest of the series first. it's literally the last game they ever released, and the last in the timeline. if you want to play doto, you have to play dishonored 1, knife of dunwall, brigmore witches, and dishonored 2 first. luckily, none of those are very long games either. 1214 hours or less."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"dread is the perfect length for a metroid game, these games are meant to be played multiple times trying to go as fast as possible. in fact 7 hours is quite long for dread."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"unless you're speedrunning the game, i'm not sure 10 hours is realistic. i guess if you skipped absolutely everything that isn't main missions, it'll be around 15 hours. but i probably put around 30 hours in before beating it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"ive played both walking dead and wolf among us, highly recommend both. walking dead is self explanatory. if you like noir and fairy tales wau is an absolute gem. any of these games are really easy to get into and out of. great for limited time commitments!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i'd say that steamworld dig 2, steamworld space and steamworld quest also are very approachable games of suitable size."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,that's what's great about hades. it could be 10 hours or could be 100 hours.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,im close in 13 hours. the game says i'm 100 but i'm missing 3 achievements get all other achievements included because they're just annoying grinds.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,"announced? that sequel is imminent my dude, and boy does it look like it's going to rip"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,"also split into chapters with a last time summary, so great if you have to keep picking it up and putting it down."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,that was a very short game. when it ended i wished it could be longer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"see the problem is when you suddenly don't have time to game for a few weeks and completely forget where you were and what you were doing, happened to me with ff7r, never got back into it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"speaking for myself, while i do enjoy playing longer games too, short games are nice because it's easier to put them down once they're done and focus on other stuff you need to be doing. for instance, i loved baldur's gate 3, but until i beat it, it was always invading my brain when i was trying to focus on work."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i i'm in a similar situation like op and i do play some long games from time to time they're mostly my comfort games i know well. i can't play some of my favourite games because they're too big, long, complex and it's hard to keep all of the stuff they require from me in mind through days or even weeks of playing. still will make them into my comfort games at some point though. i love nioh and monster hunter games too much to give up this easily"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"might be purely mental gymnastics, but it feels easier to commit to games of moderate length even if you end up playing multiple games that add up to the same length as the longer game you rejected..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yea, when a speedrun takes 32 minutes to complete but also 6 years of practice..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,"dude please don't lie to op, only if you are a speedrunner of that game you can complete it in less than 10 hours."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"for halo, i'm pretty sure there's even an achievement for a couple of the games for beating the campaign in under 3 hours. i don't quite remember if there's a difficulty tied to it though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,great game too.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,sounds good. happy cakeday!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,oh dude i hopped on as soon as i heard. it's better than i remember. get back out there pilot!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i still consider attrition to be the pinnacle of warfare. its just so epic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i'm so happy, my 8yr old just got into this game and absolutely loves it, it's such a great fps and he's really taken to all the mechanics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,on ps4 as well? love titanfall but haven't got an active ps plus subscription.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i was glad to see this. it was always such a hidden gem. i'll start playing it again shortly too, and i hope it perhaps convinces respawn to consider a titanfall 3 someday."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,and thats just on steam. doesnt account for eaorigin
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,damn i might have to get it. ive only heard great things about
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"holy shit, i'm gonna have to dive back in. loved the multiplayer on this"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"man am i glad i came across this! i recently bought the game when it was on sale because i heard how great the story was, but with the understanding that pvp was a graveyard. ill definitely make time for multiplayer later since tf1 was some of my absolute favorite gameplay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,oh i didnt! ill have to jump on. screw apex
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i was not aware. thats awesome. i loved titn fall so much
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,woah please tell me it's both titanfall 2 and on xbox. i need my titanfall again!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-02,only on pc or on every plattform?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"is that on the unofficial servers? there was a group who was tired of the hackers and ea not doing anything about it, so they took it into their own hands literally made their own hands, made an entire client and everything."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"hey, i'm the same type as you, just like you i can't stay interested enough to complete games and i play multiplayer games all the time but the portal series is damn good, you should give it a try can you also give me some single player suggestions?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"ive found when you dont want those quality games, straight up fun games are so much better. i got lost in rune factory 4 after putting off playing ghost of tsushima and spent like a couple months prolly like 100 hours crafting and building up the farm and it was great. i had far too much fun with that game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,"totally if you wanna get like a 100 completion, but its not uncommon to run through it in like 710 hours. i think i hit about 6 and a half on it. granted, i just powered through in an afternoonevening, but i dont think its unreasonable to peg it as a sub 10 for most."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"idk what you did, but that is definitely not the usual campaign length."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,ive beat it in an afternoon..
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,did you die a bunch? i just played through it last weekend after grabbing it on steam for 3 recently. 5.4 hours on normal and i was alt tabbing to talk to my friends on discord about it. was basically 3 sittings for me but i usually only play games like 2 or 3 hours in a row tops. game could definitely be played through in one sitting if you had an afternoon set aside to do it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i played the vr version and it's an amazing experience. you're basically there with her, and when see looks you in the eye it gets absurdly real. my top gamepadvr experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"hellblade is such an incredible game and it's usually really inexpensive to purchase. wow yeah, it's 85 off on gog right now. i'll take a gamble."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,had it wish listed in ps for ages and no sale
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,yeah  surround sound headphones.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,its about to beat ocarina of time seriously its that good for me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"1 for into the breach! also don't forget about their other game too, ftl!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i third, so goos"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,also free if you have netflix
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i tried this 2 times but at what time does it get fun? also does the artstyle stay this dark?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"they straight up warn you at the beginning, do not play this if you have a mental illness. it absolutely could trigger some stuff, i agree"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"it's got a lot more meat to it, yes, but the main campaign takes about eight hours httpshowlongtobeat.comgame4271"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i guess it depends on the person's definition of completed. each individual run through a timeline is quite short. and, it isn't one of those roguelikes where actually completing a run borders on impossible until you die a bunch and grind upgrades with whatever persistent currency the game uses. you can unlock different units to keep future runs fresh but they are not strictly stronger than what you start with. you can bang out a full campaign in a couple hours and 100 it in perhaps a couple dozen if you felt so inclined and you just might, it's super easy to pick up again"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"if you take completed to mean you got to the credits, then yes, it's short enough. and to be honest, i didn't feel like spending a million hours on the game, i didn't fall in love with it the same way i did with ftl. so it's definitely something that can be enjoyed for a few hours and then put aside again, without feeling you're missing out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,my wife is super picky with games but loved donut county! been harassing her to do untitled goose game next
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,1 i still think about the fish factory after 5 years of playing. what an excellent game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i full on related to the character in that scene. when it ended i ugly cried. fucking 1010 experience. btw i'm in a better place mentally now
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i expected to love this game but somehow did not manage to get into it at all beyond finding the scenery somewhat interesting.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"you can still find people on it on occasion. there just aren't as many as there used to be and if they're playing with a white cloak, any new players won't encounter them you have to beat the game at least once before you can encounter white cloaked players. edit may be worth checking out the journey subreddit to see if anyone is up for being online when one wants to play, so as to find a friend to journey with."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"my wife is not a gamer but sometimes i just turn on some game and give her controller, edith finch was one of those games and it was funny to watch her going wtf throughout whole game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"well, even if you rush to the end, there's so much to do! getting all feathers, doing all side quests, fishing for every kind of fish. there's more content than you would expect on that island!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"it's the game i go back to whenever i'm having a serious depression spell. it never fails to make me feel better, although it's a little sad to never see any companions anymore."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i don't, i'm afraid! i didn't play the vr one but i guess that technically counts as a 4th installment? but if you like slightly disturbing puzzle games i do recommend the cube escape series rusty lake which is mostly free, and the associated cheap premium games. those are some of the only other mobile games i've paid for. oh, and monument valley 12. those are something special!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i have so many of these but haven't had a chance to play them yet  i loved the last campfire, though, that one i have played!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,thanks for the recommendation!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i see what you did there
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"same, and i'm fine with that. especially considering the game isn't expensive."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yeah, same here. i really enjoyed it but replayability isnt its strength"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,you can camp in one for free
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,no offense but you really should have done research its not hard to find out the game is 90 walking and its just as easy to know if thats a good type of game for you
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,as in you're stuck in a level or you enjoy it so much you've been playing it again and again?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"there is portal stories mel. very much recommended, and free if you have portal"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i believe you. did you do the coop with your japanese girlfriend that goes to another school?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,yeah if you're looking for value the ratio of how long it takes to play vs how long it sits rent free in your head is pretty good
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,whats a humble bundle?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"the game is about how forming random connections is easier than we think, i honestly couldnt imagine how lonely itd be without another person  ill never forget my first climb of the mountain, journey is something special."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,second stray! its friggen fantastic!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i've heard plenty of good things about that game but never played it myself.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,stray was not long enough. game was beautiful
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"my mental illness and i had to nope the fuck out. the auditory noise fucked me,"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"stray's hour ratio is way, way better than movies or restaurants or beer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"you're in a thread where op is looking for shorter games, what did you expect? they likely have more money than time, where 30 is just not enough money to matter or worry about some hr ratio."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"that equates to 5hr for entertainment. that's cheap comparatively to most other alternatives outside of gaming i'm sure most wage earning adults could agree that, at the minimum, a third of what your hourly wage is assuming 15hr for entertainment sake is completely reasonable. you get paid 15 and hour to endure whatever it be let's be honest, even if you like your job nobody actually wants to be at work yet you'll subject yourself to playing a cat game for the equivilant of 5 an hour by personal choice. even if it's completely unenjoyable, i've spent much more on useless, non entertaining things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i like pretending i'm a cat but this game is a snooze fest. so boring. it's nice to look at. novelty of paying a cat wears off really fast when you notice the lore is uninspired and the gameplay a bit above superman 64.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"it's closer to a roguelike than most other roguelites. sure, you unlock ships, but each new run your ship starts over at the same basic build without any carryover upgrades. the unlocked ship layouts just off different play styles."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i platinumed it at 14 hours, main story is probs around 10 hours"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,unless it's mgs4. then it's twenty minutes of gameplay and 14 hours of cutscenes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,metal gear rising is not really long as well
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,see also final fantasy
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-09-30,you were just like me
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i agree, its a good recommendation for people who have a small window each day for gaming, but not for people who want to complete a game in a small amount of time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,right its such a good game are you going to play the second one as any of the small issues or loading times thats all fixed for ln2 it was a very good second game. since youve just finished what are your thoughts on our little friend with the yellow jacket six.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yeah i never completed witcher 3 because i got really far in, took a break, and now don't remember any of the quests i was doing so never went back lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yup, also makes it worse for me having to try to remember mechanics and controls"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yes, of course. i'm sorry, i guess i didn't give it much thought, but my point is that hollow knight is just so good and fun that op can easily bypass the 10hour limit. as he has a lot of experience in video games, i think he'll finish the game pretty quickly."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,servers fixed on ps4!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,or games pass
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"no dude, respawn fixed the official servers! lots of players back on, matchmaking working properly, the game is officially back and it feels amazing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"it seems a lot of us have this very same problem. coupled with sales and 2 free games a month from xbox and now playstation, and i have such an intimidating backlog. however, at my age 40, i'm learning that i'm kind of sick of the sweat in multiplayer games. i'm on a kick to start knocking out some real single player gems. recently i just finally beat gow 2018, and am currently halfway through on both aliens dark descent pc ff7 remake ps5, with a small break on hogwarts legacy xbox. i'm picking one game per platform and whatever tv is free or no tv  pc, i'm working on. having a blast so far. gow, while awesome, still hasn't topped my recently beat nier automata... might just be the best story i've ever seen in a game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"i play tons of single player games, i just never see them through to the end. i guess i've beaten many roguelikeslites, but i don't feel like that's the same as beating a 30 hour story driven game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i would say 68 hours maaaaaybe 10.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,i played it on normal difficulty.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"yeah, i need to git gud because i died a lot even on normal difficulty."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,it is still more of a roguelite rather than roguelike imo. considering it's more of a tactical strategy with roguelike elements but not close to original rogue in terms of design. x200b then again the whole roguelike vs roguelite debate is rather subjective.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"actually i replayed the first 4 recently, and mgs4 was the one which had the most numbers of hours of gameplay in total. it also had the most cutscenes, but i kind of appreciated having longer gameplay sequences. in terms of cutscenegameplay ratio, i'd say mgs2 is the worst at least, on a replay, maybe if you wander around more on the first playthrough it's not as bad, but on a replay i'm usually playing for like 12 minutes and here we go with another cutscene in mgs2 ."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2023-10-01,"honestly, you only need to run into one or two people to have a blast. its a short game, so back then once someone joined, they were probably going to finish it with you. being alone in this expansive desert, just seeing this mountain and trying to get there finding secrets but not being sure how to get to them and then someone shows up. you cant talk with them so they make a little short beep. you dont know what it means. now you make a short beep. they move towards something off the obvious path and make a longer beep. oooh, longer beep now means come here let me show you this. you get a thing and they do a bunch of short beeps and jump around  excitement! you continue this journey, building a little more communication based on beep length and intensity and body language, and you progress towards this thing, you dont even know what or why. and then, in the freezing cold, where you would have died alone, youre not alone. your friend is right there with you, freezing to death. its terrible and beautiful."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i wouldnt feel comfortable recommending it to most but i actually did enjoy dear esther for how strange it was. the writing was insane but internally consistent it had no very special episode life lessons to impart it wasnt going for cheap scares. it was just sadly serene and oddly uncomfortable. its very cool that it began life as a halflife 2 mod and i think one of the reasons i enjoyed it so much is that it was a good reminder that we live in a world now where the community can just take these tools and make something totally fucking bonkers with it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,snowrunner. i dont know why this game is the answer to every question on this sub. it just is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i cant think of too many, but there are very many cool games that have protracted segments with extremely low npc friendly or unfriendly interaction.  there are a few climbs in mirrors edge for example that i remember with great satisfaction.  halo 123 never had explicitly lonely sections, but the music on the ark and halo along with certain forerunner areas made it super ambient and chilling.  minecraft does the same thing really well with ambient music.  super metroid technically often had tiny critter npcs. but the whole vibe feels like you and just some florafauna. hugely satisfying and atmospheric.  theres something to be said about license tests in gran turismo games. just you, the roar of the engine, no music and the road."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"it doesnt count, but my favourite game that at least approaches this sort of isolated design is halo odst. there are two sides to the game, the main part is slinking around the freshly abandoned city of new mombasa immediately after the master chief and the unsc fought their way through it in halo 2. the only things left alive are you, covenant patrols, and the indirect messages left by the citys ai superintendent that communicates solely through traffic signs and safety recordings. the second part of the game are flashback missions where you romp around as your squadmates in more traditional halo levels, but exploring the city as the rookie is where odst truly shines. the rain, the gloomy neon lights, the smooth jazz, odst feels very inspired by blade runner. if youve never played odst, you owe it to yourself to boot up the game with a solid headset and play it at night when youre completely alone."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"for the most part yes, but the ocean is deep and dark and let's just say you're not at the top of the food chain. it can be very scary at times depends on what you're scared of, but what i will say is i tend not to play scary games but subnautica is one of my favourite games i've ever played."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"it will scare you a little bit until you learn how everything works and then it's an amazing chill game... unless you have a fear of oceans, then it will scare you a lot and never be chill."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,it's extremely chill and relaxing. and then very suddenly it isn't.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i'm in the same boat. hate the sandbox survival games. and i think the difference is subnautica has actual goals other than make base biggermore complicated. everything you collect and build is geared toward the goal of finding the answers to a mystery and ultimately escaping. there's a concrete end goal and obvious steps you need to accomplish to get there. changes the dynamic completely.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i too love snow runner but i enjoy it more causally. i don't think i could do no teleports, that would be challenging."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,prime 1 definitely fits tho.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i tried the story mode and didn't enjoy it at all. switched to survival mode and had a blast. wandering around freely without any real objective other than staying alive made for a very fun experience.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,imagine the pissiness for those of us that started playing at release on steam. i only just got back into it after many years
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"man you're telling me. i got into it when it was in beta. that was what, 6 years ago? and they still haven't finished the main questline?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"oh yeah episodes have been coming out since it came out of early access in 2017 i think it was. not many people play for the story mode though, most of us play survival. the story mode has a sort of mixed reception in the community."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"they are still working on it, the final episodes the next one coming."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,no and i'm worried that they might not.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,late 2024 i think.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"reminder that the rock only stuns the bunny  it's you picking it up, hearing it's little peep noise and selecting kill to snap the neck that does the job"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i'll admit that was the worst part of the game for me. since there are other sources of meat, i try to kill only as many rabbits as are needed for crafting items."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i wish they'd get riven working on pc, with hd graphics, it would be beautiful have i got some news for you.httpsstore.steampowered.comapp1712350riven"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"in theory it's happening, there was a fan project 'the starry expanse and their work has been adopted, along with some of their team, into an official cyan remake. i haven't seen news on it in a while, though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i liked it for the exploration some truly incredible environments this time and it had some good puzzles. theres pretty much no reading in it, which will probably not sit well with myst fans. i think i liked it more than obduction but im in the minority."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i loved obduction. i enjoyed firmament but found it less satisfying than obduction, so it might not be for you. you don't directly interact with anything in the environment like you do in most cyan games. instead, you use these gauntlets that fit into sockets. it made it more clear what you could interact with, but i found it to be an odd mechanic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,was gonna mention sotc but i was torn if agro counted as an npc. is epona an npc? where is the line between mountcompanion
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i think i was playing on creative mode or whatever it's called where there are no npcs at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-16,"there were no villagers when i playedin the mode i played. so i'm very much referring to a particular snapshot in time, particular mode, etc..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"last coop run that my buddy and i started had water and power set to shut off at the default time. game starts, and there's already no water on day 1. but the power stayed on for the whole two months we survived. only died because we decided it was bath day down by the river. saw a lone zed that must've wandered across the bridge, since we'd spent an ingame week systematically clearing our half of the island. we shot that zed. then, three more came out of the woods behind him. then we saw ten coming down across the bridge. then we saw hundreds coming from the other side of the island we hadn't cleared out yet. all because we shot a few 9mm."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,sounds like me and my friend xd the both of us just went straight into oh fuck me sideways mode
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yeeeah, i mean maybe they will... but npc's have been on the todo list since 2013."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,with their development timeline that can be anywhere from in the next year to the next five.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,let me specify no living humans
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,if enemy ai count than literally no game applies to this
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i met the best friend i ever had in journey. one of the people i've cared the most about in all my life. for a few hours, i loved that person like a brother. never saw them or talked to them again after we finished the game. journey is perfect in every way as far as i'm concerned."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"oh, i've always wanted to say this um, actually, super metroid is the third game. the second game is called samus returns and was released on the game boy. in all seriousness, though, they knocked it out of the park with super metroid. it was, indeed, the tits."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,the fact the ending gives you an existential dread by being alone in the bottom of the abyss is truly terrifying.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,true but you still feel very alone in there.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"four, i think. two girls, radio lady, creepy man."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i loved the ending. such a gut punch.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,thats the point. you were supposed to feel what he felt. cant run from your problems. have to face them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,factorio would like a hand raised.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,if we dont consider ada an npc. thats the hard part because are minecraft villagers npcs? or are they a just mechanic of the game? cause if its the later id include a ton of factory builder and city builder games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"ive actually never gone to an npc village, the game can be played without interactions"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"a lot of folks try to disparage it by calling it a walking simulator, but it was one of the most visually stunning experiences i have had in a game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yeah, but at that point can't it be argued it's just stanley's internal monologue?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yea i guess it adds a lot to the atmosphere playing valheim alone but isn't there a merchant also? maybe they could add more npcs in the future, kinda like terraria and you can build houses for them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"nah, npc are not in the game yet. there are some mods that add them but they're super janky."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,theres like a raccoon thing that speaks to you and thats about it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,only with mods but the devs may also add survivors in the future
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,glados is a robot and the only talking thing besides chatty chell. so technically your still alone with no humans left because they got killed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,yeah it is!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-22,"i actually haven't played edith finch yet, but from what i've heard, there's just a little nod to the main character of unfinished swan in it, and the theme song of unfinished swan is used as the theme of one of the edith finch characters."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"that game is so fucking stressful, the atmosphere is great and i love games with stalker ai"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,correct. the helicopter guy only helps you board the copter.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,sorry boss i just wanna say my one of my favourite games
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,all systems online.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"as much as everyone else seemed to love it, i never liked the prawn suit. give me the fast and maneuverable sea moth any day. i did almost the whole game with just the sea moth, while my prawn suit and cyclops just sat at the base."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yeah, by making below zero story more cinematic they ruined a lot of atmosphere in the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i just pretend that below zero doesn't exist. subnautica will always be there and that crappy sequel won't ruin it for me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"the game will still be a solo experience, just with multiplayer as an option for those who want it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i was worried about this too, but i believe the devs said the game will be meant to be played solo and co op will be a side thing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,piloting the cyclops co op with a buddy is literally my dream game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,sadly the devs very specifically dont want it to be a horror or tense game. which is a shame because i think its one of its greatest strengths
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,from what i heard is that they didnt intentionally wanted to make this scary it just so happens everyone has a fear of bigcunts in water
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"if they add coop and you dont want to play coop, then dont choose to play that way. it changes nothing for anyone, except people who are happy w having the option to play w people. maybe if you werent an insufferable crybaby, youd have people to play games with"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,youd think but thats not what theyre calling it atm
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"below zero wasn't intended as a true sequel, which is why it sits in an awkward space where it's more than an expansion but not quite big enough to be a proper sequel. which is why people regard the next game as subnautica 2 as it looks like its going to be a similar size game to the og game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,next title is subnautica serviced alive
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"oh yeah  but i've done outer wilds in vr, so i'm pretty comfortable with 3d movement at this point, i think."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"ahh okay, i might give it a bash  thank you for replying!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,"i didnt really find it to be all that terrifying. i made sure to stay the hell away from the edges of the map where it drops into the abyss, and i saved often. i actually really enjoyed the atmosphere combined with the music."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"okay, thank you  i'm okay with scary stuff, just have high anxiety, wasn't sure if this game would be a problem or not."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"subnautica has a similar vibe to the long dark for me, in terms of scare factor. neither are scary like jump scares, but they definitely psychologically creepy!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i really liked story mode it is hard and merely surviving felt like an accomplishment.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,for real that would suck. would be cool to have warnings on crap like that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,tbf they completely scrapped and redid the first 2 episodes from the ground up which took them like 12 years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,why is that? been a long while since i played it
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,its been a while but i had the most trouble just throwing itaiming. the mouse acceleration was so bad it made it very difficult.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,weren't villagers added later? i swear i would only see animals and enemy mobs on youtube videos.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"they are in creative, just a later addition villages feel more alive now than before they were added."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"we shot that zed oops. a single zed gets pushed down and stomped out, every time lmao. gunshots are so loud in that game, and you are generally fucked if you fire one without clearing a huge radius."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,yes there is
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"the best part is, it was probably a few different people!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,deservedly half of metroidvania .
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,that ending was so fkn good
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i need to replay it, i played it at launch and havent since then."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,the factory must grow
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,valid point. i think it can.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,but it functions as an npc with scripting that you interact with
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,ok now i know nothing about this game but im instantly more interested.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,"you are the best captain on the planet, im not even squidding"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"it's not just that, they could've taken the same approach without telling you so much directly. i mean, they literally put one of the aliens in your brain so they can explain a ton about everything going on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,l take
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,problem is usually companies are too lazy to balance the game for both.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"can you imagine the horror of being completely alone, traversing an alien planet , then just seeing some random guy called turkeyfucker22 teabagging a cuddlefish"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,they did.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"why are you throwing insults? im also not complaining? its wonderful theyre adding coop for the people that want it, i was just mentioning how for me when i play scary games the tension drops off greatly when theres other people around."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"they in this instance are reporters. the devs have just called it the next subnautica. in the subnautica sub right now, there are a handful of people that are very adamant that their chosen number is the only correct choice and will make sure you know it using all caps, poor grammar and multiple exclamation points."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"oh man that's kinda hard to say. several large areas of the game are clearly designed specifically to induce anxiety. murky areas of low visibility that are particularly dangerous. huge play area with many biomes and no map at all creature ai that has no problem following you into safe areas and just deciding to live there now. limited oxygen with sometimes mazelike cave exploration elements and things you can get tangled up in heading to a beacon through a new area and there's nothing around you but black in every direction and then you hear something roar. of course the computers helpful dialog like warning multiple leviathan class life forms detected in this area, are you sure whatever you're doing is worth it? there's plenty more. i also have anxiety but this game is a favorite of mine. just have to play it and see if it's for you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"it's a similar feeling in survival mode but i think there's more freedom. it can be a real challenge starting in different zones that have less resources, etc. maybe i'll give story mode another shot."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"games far too easy, there is no pressure and endless resources. they dumbed down the difficulty for console release awhile back and made the game basically a kids game now, serious players need not apply."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i got too emotionally invested too quickly lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yeah, but of the 6 years? if they need help envisioning the future of the story i'll help pro bono. i've been waiting since i was nearly a child. i'm almost 30 now, lmao."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"ah. if ever you get back to it, note that if your target is between your index and thumb, it should hit. i play on pc but with a controller. maybe go for that? or adjust your sensitivity setting. i don't know why i'm piling on advice you didn't ask for sorry lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yup, didnt exist before 2013."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-16,yeah that's my point  i was playing long before they were added.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,"that's just the saddest part we're usually smarter and know better than to shoot unnecessarily! we'd just gotten very comfy and complacent, lmao. said to one another, why not? what's the harm? there's no others around here we already killed them. it was just a string of poor choices and a bit of bad luck."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,examples?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i wouldn't be surprised. man, i need to get back into journey and try for the white robe."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"lol, they're referring to the dev mascot that gives directions in the tutorial."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,removed
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,dont know why youre getting downvoted. its very rare in my experience to find a game that supports co op and has a fantastic single player experience
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,and thank god for that
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"reporters and the publisher. but then the publisher described it as a gaas, which the devs denied, so who knows?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i think the only reason it could be called 2 is if it was very similar to the first one and very different from bz. perhaps to show that even the devs think that bz was bad and that they are trying to go back. but i think it wasn't bad, just... mediocre. and i think the next game should be called 3, or at the very least not have a number at all. not that anyone cares what i think."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,was story mode just surviving as long as possible without an end? not sure i would like that. part of what sucked about story mode maybe survival was like this too there was certain mechanics that werent really explained ot was annoying.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,hey cool thanks for that. totally worth your time posting it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,most players still seriously struggle with interloper i find.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,same. i think it was in the hanger tutorial like part with his ex where i was into like something funny going in here in this game
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,"that's all it takes, man. i lost a fourmonth run that had cleared riverside almost entirely i was carrying a full water cooler back to my base when the one store i hadn't cleared busted a window, and two zeds killed me. like 3500 killed, all of the city systematically emptied of the nonperishables and gas tanks, and it was just two little walkers that caught me off guard. i didn't have time to drop the tank, and was too encumbered by it to fight. dragged down and killed, just like that lmao"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"the stanley parable is one that comes to mind, can't think of anything that has an actual ai off the top of my head there. could also say microsoft solitaire if that counts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,dat's a bot
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i mean, early halos did it really well, but its very few and far between. and who knows, reddit gunna reddit i guess."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,dying light ?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i don't even think bz was mediocre. it was just different
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i think there was the story mode and then the survival mode was maybe called endless. and, yeah, it was just day after day of surviving without any other objectives. i enjoyed it because there wasn't anything pushing me through the game. i could relax and figure everything out in my own time, and move on to harder areas when i felt ready. it was still challenging. items were random, so you didn't always find the same things in the same places, or not at all. you can start with better or worse clothing, etc, depending on difficulty settings. lots of fun."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"its the truth for others reading this as the studio disabled the hard difficulty interloper for all of the new paid content released last year, so even returning players will know. its important to hardcore players."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,most players know interloper is disabled with all of the content released over the last year.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,stanley parable has the narrator which you interact with. it has no physical model but its an npc with scripting so defo doesnt count
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"ooo, heard nothing but good things about stanley. i'mma wishlist it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"the first halo games are an interesting example, because i played the absolute fuck out of halo one. perfect age was like 12 when it came out. but even though i absolutely loved it on both single player and coop, the legendary difficulty really felt very unbalanced between coop and single player. on co op on very hard areas we'd have someone stand in safety, the other guy run out and do what damage he could do before he died, then respawn and take turns. it didn't feel like the hardest difficulty was really 'fair' for singleplayer, since you could get fucking obliterated by a cannon shell from offscreen without any warning and be forced into a lengthy restart. still incredible game and i loved it, but i do think that sort of balance issue on hard difficulties is indicative of making something that works for both co op and single player"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i've not played it, so very happy to defer to your judgement that it nails it! i'd just say that in general i think it's very hard to find a good horror game that also works with coop  multiplayer, since a big part of the essence of horror games is that being lost and alone feeling would be interested to know how dying light solves that in your mind?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,yeah i can see the appeal now. sounds weird cuz you could die. but i do remember the game feeling really cozy at times being out in the cold then coming into shelter lighting a fire and cookig some tea or food. watching the warmth meter move etc. a game where there is no goal but you can just chill and play can be amazing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,"eh? sorry, you've lost me. i'm still playing an interloper game from before the dlc dropped and beyond the new stuff there doesn't seem to be anything to make the game any easier."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"i haven't actually played a game since they released the dlc so i didn't realise, still waiting for the whole thing to come out before i start a new one."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,"yep, definitely has moments that feel cozy. sitting inside by a lit stove, listening to a storm rattle the windows as i waited for a can of snow to melt and boil, for example. the nights with the aurora borealis are especially lovely. it is probably my favorite survival game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,none of the dlc content is available for difficulties beyond voyager. you can play interloper but you are just in the sand box with zero new items etc. just so you know you will never completed anything.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-14,i found it odd how cozy it is. i hate the snow. but snow and cold and wind does make you appreciate the indoors and heat!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2024-02-15,"ah, yeah, gotcha. i did those with a custom gunloper playthrough. i recall reading there was some controversy with interloper. yeah that sucks."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-31,best pumpkin carving i've seen this year.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-31,it took me longer than i wish to admit to figure out how every part of the title was related.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-01,calvin and hobbes  limbo? is this a mod? because i will play the shit out of that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-31,"hey guys dae le calvin and hobbes or is it just le me? limbo never gets any love in this subreddit, dae think so o btw its a pumpkin carving because that never gets posted editheres a mad moxxi cosplay"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-01,thankyou! i really didn't expect it to get this much attention d
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-10-31,"that picture has been my desktop background for years. i second this sentiment, get to work master pumpkineers!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-01,thanks  it was really fiddly but worth it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-01,i carved mine last friday and today it looks horrible!! i waited till the tree had curled a bit before taking the picture but next year i think i will wait until the night before to start carving. i didn't realise how quickly it would start to dry out and curl up.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2012-11-01,"usually we carve about a week before halloween and everything lasts till a couple days after. this year however, my wife just carved the limbo ch pumpkin last night and it was already super dry. i think we just picked out a bad batch this year."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"awesome! i made a charcoal limbo drawinghttpimgur.comusmyo recently as well, only i layered several screenshots for the reference."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,i drew a penis on a desk today.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-14,i'm jealous. it looks fantastic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,what was your technique? i only learned two styles blacking out the canvas then erasing gradually or building up from blank. i was wondering because you obviously have quite a talent and want to know what worked.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,skimming past this i thought it was just an ingame pic. very nice and very well done
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,hey do you sell any of these? i am a big limbo fan
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,i hate being arachnophobic
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,this is sick!! good job dude!
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,cheers on using a medium other than a computer
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,where's limbo drawing 1?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,it looks like the guy from the lorax
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,reminds me of world of goo
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,this is great and all and i would have loved limbo had it not been a little more frustrating. i have a strong loathing for this game for what it did to my self esteem.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"ah, makes me want to play through it again. nice!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,i'm pretty sure there is supposed to be water under the log after he pushes it off why would he be pushing it into grass that's just silly.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,scared the shit out of me as an adult.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,that's probably the easiest thing to draw in the world. rgaming's standards are met and exceeded.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"nooooo, not the spider!! holy shit! run!!!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,charcoal is one of the best and most frustrating mediums. you often create a great shape only to realize you smudged the hell out of it a few minutes later.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-16,fuck that spider in the dick.
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"i like the artstyle of limbo, it's original but that's about it. the game is completely underwhelming."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"i would hate to see your hands after working with that much charcoal. regardless of how much you wash, everything you touch will have small black flakes all over it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,great job
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-16,"really cool art, even if limbo was pretty bad."

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"oh man the amount of deaths i got in this game was absolutely ridiculous, but boy was this a great game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,i second that. i have a late friend that worked with charcoal too.

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,then why the hell didn't you upload it? what were you thinking?
Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,i lightly shade the whole paper with a chamois and then work in the darks and lights. its all preference!

Reddit,Puzzle,Limbo,2013-01-15,"i've just completed it, but i found my deaths weren't too bad until bam the last 3 chapters when i must of racked up over 100 deaths figuring the gravity lifts and the timed jumps out."
