1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Just don't tell them.

My buddy died (fuck heroin) and his brother just wiggled his way into his steam account. 

I've heard stories of people contacting steam to say their loved one has passed, and steam closed the account. 

If your loved one dies, blessings and love for your family, but also light identity theft isn't a big deal.

Dont do heroin."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Did that one Reddit post about asking Steam support really blow up this much?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Just leave your credentials on some visible piece of paper among your stuff and you're good to go. I mean, Steam can't really tell the difference between you and someone else, right...?"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Can an LLC be owner of the licenses?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Couldn't you like... include all relevant login info in your will? If they are your next of kin, accessing your 2FA shouldn't be hard."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just don't die then? skill issue smh
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just a reminder that GOG sells DRM FREE GAMES so you can just hand off an external drive to your inheritors.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Bruce Willis had beef with apple about this same issue with his iTunes music collection long time ago.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I'll give the ownership to my children...

Just ignore the porn game."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I don’t think my son or daughter would like to see that their dad played eight hours of mirror and finished the game in one afternoon twenty or so years ago.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,How the fuck are they gonna know I'm dead if someone is still playing my games..
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"What?! I think they need to fix this. People are not immortal, so digital game purchases should be transferrable to inheritors."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"laws around digital goods need to be reformed FAST, because if not we will soon see that companies have full control over what people buy, as more and more goods are digital.

this shit should not be legal."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Not everyone is going to share the same sentiment as me. 

But I don’t really care about any of my stuff after I die."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,If only there was a way to leave my login info to my next of kin…
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Is this even a concern if I got family share turned on? Guess you could always leave a note
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"As a millennial, my Steam account is the most valuable thing I own. This is such an injustice. My grandchildren will never be able to inherit my gamer legacy."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,We will own nothing and like it :(
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,We need digital media rights to be protected at a federal level. But our federal representatives barely understand technology...
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Whichever child gets my steam account as their inheritance will have a treasure trove of classics.....wait I have porn games, that shit is going with me to the grave."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,How exactly? My Steam account is not attached to my legal name whatsoever. Payment details doesn't count because there's no rule that would prevent someone from paying for someone else's games.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Of course not, because people with a lot of money need more of *your* money. 

They want a piece of every pie. Those games someone wants to leave in a will are profit on the table. Not sure what the deal was here with this whole “Valve is the good guy” theme in this sub, they are a business and don’t exist for the benefit of anyone or anything except themselves."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I plan to load my  brain into a computer so I can play forevermore
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I’ll just give one of my kids or grandkids my password.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I saw that original post and it's all such bullshit. All your accounts are in legal limbo. Leave your fucking passwords in your will

Not an expert on EU law by any means but I can see this being applicable in this situation as well. You can sell your videogames, so this must mean they're goods. Goods are inheritable. Right? Probably really iffy reasoning lmao."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"The new family sharing option helps, at least someone could make use of my games. After everyone in the family dies though, though.. womp womp"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,My brother died 6 years ago and I still play games from his massive library.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"IF I pass on my email and steam ID, Those fucks have 0 way of figuring out anything. Yeah they might not agree with it but its not like they are witch hunting the accounts that ARE doing it....

its just a shit rule thats not enforced whatsoever at least that we have seen in the news"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"oh look, another reddit post scraped and turned into an article, lol."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"A part of me is surprised that this has become such an issue. Why do people think that others will even want their steam account when they die?

Look at any charity/thrift store, most of the things they are selling are from dead people. The collections of CDs, movies, records etc that were passed on and not wanted because they are the dead persons taste, or out of fashion because they are old.

How are games any different? Who is going to want my steam library of games from when I was alive when I’m dead? There will be so many game for the recipient by then that really I’m just passing on a backlog they likely won’t touch."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I can't wait to leave my family all my hentai games.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Not if my son steals my identity
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,How about using login and password of said passed person? What’s the problem with that?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"The way I see it, if I had all physical media, then natural wear and tear would mean most, if not all of it wouldn’t work by the time I die. If I had my games through something like GOG and stored on an external drive, then by the time I die I doubt anyone would have a PC that could run them due to compatibility issues outside of emulation anyway. 


I do think we need to sort out the bullshit of digital distribution not being treated as ownership, but it’s not the only issue here."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Remember to sell or gift your account to someone right before you die. That way your account won't be stuck in limbo forever.

Also, sony and microsoft transfer dead people's accounts to any surviving kids or inheriters to the dead. Kinda suprised valve doesn't."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Couldn't you just pass down the account details forever? You can get steam gift cards everywhere and the age verification doesn't matter at all.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Idk I'm passing my account down to my kids when I have them one day
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Just leave your kid your credentials lol
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Sooooo, I can’t just have like a steam beneficiary?  Like in the banks?"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Should have stuck with GoG from the get go.

My plan is to build a tower, download everything, set steam to offline mode and take out the network interface card."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"If I can never own it, then pirates are just borrowing things."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,can my child inherit my steam account if I specified that in my last will?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I mean, judging by some people’s game collections it might be for the best."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,My son has the login in 1pass. What’s mine is his. 
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"This questions what it means to own a game. Publishers want you to own nothing; it's only licensed to you. And I mean, sure. I don't necessarily disagree with your licenses expiring when you die for obvious reasons. It's this thing that publishers are doing where *they change the terms of your license after you've bought the license,* ***UBISOFT****,* that needs to be addressed."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Seems like much to-do about nothing. Between family sharing and just plain giving someone your password (hell include it in your will) is it really the end of the world? Like normally I'm all about preservation and future-proofing but I know this stems out of that one guy on Reddit making a fuss over emailing Steam support.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Good. I like the mystery. I also hope a bot takes over and randomly plays for me in random games. That would freak everyone out.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Note to self: put steam account info in will
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Leave your steam login with your heirs, they'll have to fight for it though.  Only the strongest deserves access to my library!"

Start a company for holding all your digital content. Pass ownership of the company on."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Bury them with me like the pharaohs of old
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Ehh, there are worse games to be stuck in than limbo!"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,It's cool. If I die will someone please finish the total war Warhammer 2 campaign. Tyrion. My computer bricked and fuck those orcs
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,But Steam Family Library still exists right?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,No they won’t.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just wait for the EU to enact laws enforcing the right to pass on digital licenses
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"No they won't, just pass down yor login details to whomever you want, end of story."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Personally, I'm glad all my video games are safely stored behind a 5000 page EULA I've never read but agreed to. Aren't you?


Hail corporate!"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Steam doesn't even care how old I am, judging by the fact it keeps asking and accepting random dates, so I doubt they're gonna check obituaries. I still have my dad's amazon account running, and he's been gone a couple years. 

Like the man said, write the damn passwords on a piece of paper. Boom."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Your steam account is owned by the email.

It's not hard. Have the email, have the account."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Need to start adding all the logins and passwords to your wills.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"“And to my wife, I leave my Steam account.”"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just give your kid the password and don’t say anything to steam.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-26,"1) Create game called ""Legal Limbo""

2) I slowly accumulate all the Steam games in the world.

3) Will forever have the highest achievement score."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,And I won’t care because I’m dead
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Those of you saying to pass down login info forgot about Steam Guard
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Just leave all digital assets, purchases, licenses to next of kin in your will and include login access. Not rocket science"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,So? I'm the only one in my family that played them
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,They should  find a way to put up the libraries for donations.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Maybe *your* Steam games will be...
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Your Steam account will self destruct in T-minus 69 years.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Even if your account is 150 years old, it's none of their business.

Just leave your credentials with a friend or something, say ""Feel free to share these games with kids"""
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just store the email info linked to Steam account
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Will it to a trust to be held in perpetuity.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,What will become of my sims??
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Easy solution, don't die. 

Cyber Steam ^2077"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I would like to believe that new games come out at a fast enough rate that this is a non issue. Unless, of course, Steam starts penny pinching."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Says you.  My ghost is planning to possess my computer and we're paying for eternity.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Couldn't you just use the account access to share the library through family sharing?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Question I have is what about the family sharing option when someone passes?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,You can probably put it in a will
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,If steam libraries were passable on by will I think it would both do some good and get some good press and goodwill in the long term. Just a thought
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"After I die? I'm already 124 years old, pretty sure at this rate I'm immortal on steam."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,... public domained games are gonna be a thing just like cinema is becoming now
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Pass it onto your children never hide the password from them
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Not if I give the password to someone.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"By the time I die, I don't think my grown up children will want to play with my decades old games that they never heard about. I don't even think I'll be thinking about Steam in my 60s/70s. And if I die suddenly, my children will be either to young to play the games I am playing or they're old enough that I'm already sharing my account with them."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I wonder if I can transfer my account to my son through my will.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"For everyone saying why do people care it's because of the bullshit the world was slept walked into with digital rights

You don't own shit and it can be taken from you.. games can be delisted and removed movies and tv shows taken even if you used the buy now option and things like steam can't be transferred

People are starting to care about that and the laws need to be reformed"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Not really... leave account credentials in the will, if you have multiple gamers use/create a family share with the deceased and you can inherit the library amongst the family. IF you have a scumbag family member willing to report the account over this or that... well they were going to screw you over the distribution of assets in the will anyways. You don't need to use the account, and if Steam steps in and bans the account anyways just sue them for violating the terms of the estate.

IF the decedent is smart, they will specifically list the people (or Steam accounts) by name who will legally be allowed to game share their library. You can get real specific and use that numbered unique identifier everyone gets with their account so Valve cannot dispute who has access to that library, and they cannot argue with the court when the proper systems they provide are used to extend the decedents library amongst the survivorship of the estate.

PS: I'm not a lawyer, but considering how many frivolous lawsuits we have had in the United States over the years, just claiming ""Sharing the account is against the ToS"" won't hold up if creating this family share is the final action the account takes and people don't actually use the account to play that specific library. I doubt Valve will get involved with disputing every claim against each and every estate on Earth SO LONG AS PEOPLE DON'T USE THAT ACCOUNT TO ACTIVELY PLAY GAMES!"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"No they won't. I have my current credentials, i.e, the key to my password database, with a trusted source. It's a friend of 20 years, and I trust them to handle that shit, if I should ever snuff it."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Honestly, you should have a contingency plan to transition the credentials which access all of your important assets. Just be sure to include Steam."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,At least one steam user has already been rendered dead over the course of steam's years of existence.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Um no, my best friend has my info and I've already expressly said he can have it to do what he wishes if I die early. It will be placed in my will. If I have kids the account would go to them and they'd have to share but faily share would always work beucase I'd neve be online, lmao."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I plan on leaving a treasure map to my steam credentials, one day leading a band of misfit children on a coming of age adventure to save their home in a race against time"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Personally I'd want to write into my Will that my closest group of friends can use my account after I die and turn it into a shared one.

At least I'm hoping they Steam would allow that."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,So hard to just leave them the login info?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I gave my son my Steam creds, and I have his."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I would actually be fine with my game purchases being licenses for life. But I would want it to be clear. And I would want it to work both directions. If the digital goods I buy are licenses, and not personal goods to be owned in perpetuity, there has to be at least *some* minimum level of support the publisher is required to provide. If a game is delisted, I need to retain ownership. If it's being removed or canceled entirely, I need copies of the game files, DRM free. Wtf is DRM even for once a publisher has determined they're not going to profit any further? And I need these assurances to come from the government, with an actual enforcement mechanism behind them."

I log into Steam and see hundreds of games I never purchased and see how many hours my friend played of those games.  I get sad thinking about all the games he put time in, and I don't want to lose his account because it is the last thing I have left of him.

I hope I never lose his family account because I have no way of getting it back.  I remember arguing over video games and animes. It was some of the most fun conversations I have ever had.  RIP, buddy."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Not really. They’ll remain tied to your Steam account with no way to transfer them to a different account but you can give your whole account to someone. It’ll be inconvenient since they would have to switch between your account and theirs depending on whose library they are playing from but they’ll still have your games.

My EA account will die with me. That account has become the pink bedroom filled with Barbies and stuffed unicorns that my parents would never let me have, and The Sims 4 is the Barbie Dream House I knew better than to ask my parents for."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,media going digital was great but now legally it is more renting than owning. especially with content that requires online connection we have seen games been turned off since companies like ubisoft do not want to pay the pennies for people to keep using it. if steam decided they no longer wanted to support a game you could be shit out of luck even before you die
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Jokes on them. I told my buddy where I wrote down and hid my Steam password and told him to go get it if I die.

Interesting point"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I wrote my steam games into my will. They go to my nephew. If steam wants to go into a legal battle with a 12 year old (if I beat the dust the next 10 years or so). They are welcome to try. He gets a fit if he doesn't get what he wants.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Nothing new. Unless you PHYSICALLY own a thing and it's not DCMA locked to a device, assume you will never be able to pass it on. The service will either not last or the agreement to the content will go away.  


I can buy DVD's for at $1 for 3 at my local thrift store. I'm going to start to collect and digitally download them all as a backup to then have on my Plex server. A cheap way to own movies and other media I might not have access to later in life or feel like I want to keep paying $20 to $50 a month (streaming in 30 years I assume) to watch stuff I bought years ago for 33 cents. 

I'd love that after 30 years media becomes public domain for broadcast, this way we could have a way to enjoy old media all in one place and force companies to make new stuff to make money. You can't sell the old media, but you can stream it for free. A true digital archive of media for all to enjoy."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Are we really still on this? Just write your damn login credentials on a piece of paper. You should've anticipated this when you bought digital games.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Imagine not just writing your steam account details in your will and saying “I bequeath my Unusuals and CS:GO weapon skins to my wife.”  It’s not “legal limbo”, it’s “Hmm yes, I will my steam library to someone but I won’t actually give them my login”.

As all one has to do to have total control over a Steam account is sign in, Steam Support has to take the stance of “if he wanted you to have access, he’d give you his login details”.  Now if it was brought to their attention that the owner had passed away and his heir was using the account, and they did nothing, yeah, it’s cool."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Just write down your passwords, it's not that hard."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I have 2 cloud accounts with a KeePass file with all my accounts which go into the hundreds of various game, banking, and general sites I have. My wife has the passwords to both my cloud accounts and the KeePass file.  I also have an external SSD with the same KeePass file. I also have a single USB thumb drive with that KeePass file.  So if anything happens to her or me we have access to each other's accounts. I keep the KeePass file updated often. I am also one of those people who keeps multiple backups of everything. All information she might need to disable my 2FA on accounts is also saved in that KeePass file.

I have twin 8-year-old boys who are now PC gamers so if I die for whatever reason I know they both will have my accounts and I am cool with that.

I like to plan ahead like this. Shit happens and I could drop dead or be killed just walking out to get my mail. I can't imagine the headache she and my kids would have to go through to get into some of those accounts I have and I don't want that so I made it as easy as I could for them."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Which is why my son has full access to my steam account. He's probably the only 16 year old with a 15 year old steam account.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"This is absolutely crazy of an article. However, having done a deep dive myself personally on what happens to our digital lives when we die I found a few interesting things. you’ll have to excuse me if this is worded a little weird I’m using voice to text on my phone phone. My hands cramping today. Most companies still do not account for the death of their users and do not have policies for the terms of Service their publicly posted with their online content. 

Different companies who do have policies in place are all different. For instance, to get somebody’s Google account or Microsoft account you need to talk to an escalated Google representative or Microsoft representative and arranged to send a copy of the death certificate of the account owner to them before they will release name and password , and two factor credentials. In the case of Samsung, I believe they also do the same thing. However, on the flipside of that Apple, when you notify them of a users death, they put the account in question in their release or whatever it is to basically be deleted within six months to a year. Even if you show them a copy of a death certificate for the account holder, they will not release the account to you and that is a single year of security that I am very pleased Apple has.

In the case of games, game content and things like steam, you would have to contact their customer service and find out what their individual afterlife policies are in obtaining accounts. I’m sure as more and more of the digital users online age, this will become more commonly addressed across the board as members of certain sites and certain platforms die off. 

As a reminder to people, it is always a good idea to keep an updated list of passwords and accounts written down somewhere with a living, or power of attorney. This way, if there is information in any of these accounts that your family may need to finalize certain aspects of your affairs they will have access to them. Personally, I have every single major digital account that allows it accounted for in my will. And I also have a deadman switch email that if I do not use it within a certain amount of time it will contact certain people with instructions on how to get into other accounts.

I hope this is enough information for people to be able to understand that digital content, games, emails, and accounts are still a very young legal field when it comes to the dying in the deceased."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I’ll just make sure my daughter inherits all of my physical and digital games
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"All your games work without steam, unless the developer of the game implented some sort of DRM. But true you cannot access or download them anymore."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just give your account info to someone wtf.

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"We are currently in the era that will shape this issue and it shakes out one of two ways:

1. We, are a population and society, create ballot measures, or pressure our elected officials, to change the law to allow for true ownership of digital goods (and I swear to Christ, if someone mentions NFTs, I will find you and forcefeed you a GPU). This would entail forcing companies providing a version of any piece of media we purchase that is usable and storable offline, which is fairly straightforward for video, music, books, et cetera, and for most games, but provides a challenge for games that are primarily played online (MMOs, MOBAs, and the like). This gets more tangled when you consider what version of a living, evolving, game a purchaser might own and be required to have access to. It wouldn’t be an easy issue to solve and we’d likely have to go several rounds to properly refine the laws around this as new issues and edge cases arise. In this case, something like a Steam library becomes an inheritable good like a bank account whose contents can go to one person or split among multiple.

2. We stay the current course and companies don’t sell us a copy of their work that we have perpetual access to, but a license to use it until a nebulous time in the future that they choose, at which point they can revoke it. This is the “we do nothing” option (or maybe, more grimly, we try and fail because we live in a society dominated by corporate wellbeing over human life and happiness). In this case, the best we can hope for is Valve turning the Steam accounts of the deceased into memorial accounts a la Facebook; the worst case is they just wipe the existence of that account after death."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Steam is going the US military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" approach of account inheritance. I personally only think Steam don't allow account ownership transfers because they're conforming to what the rest of the industry is doing (games becoming less and less owned but rather ""leased"" out to people who buy a ""license"").

For now, the issue is moot since it's so easily circumvented. I do suspect that once Steam's age starts approaching the limits of natural human lifespan, that some ""anti-inheritance"" safe checks will be put in place with some pressure from the game industry. Such as linking a name and DOB to the account on creation and requiring a scan of official ID or documents every couple of years.

I would hate for any of that to happen, but I don't suspect Steam wants to play the good guy on this issue like they do on others, putting their foot down on game ownership could easily backfire on their agreements with big game developers and have them jump ship to other platforms, or their own."

Yes, Steam legally can’t give digital products to others in wills. That is primarily because digital media laws have not caught up to the technology yet.

However, there is nothing legally preventing you from putting in your estate your login credentials to your Steam Account. You’d just leave your password and username to your lawyer and state who gets it. Upon passing, your lawyer would give them a document or flash drive with said information.

By the time the accounts get old enough for Steam to be suspicious, there will likely be a new library service that will hold your games."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I can't wait for my child to go into my steam account when I die and just stare at all the games before turning it off and doing something else. Just like his old man 🥲

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,All you have to do is tell somebody your password
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"A bunch of services, including Google/gmail, have the ability to give your account credentials to someone else if you don’t access the account in a set period of time. 

I think I have mine set to give my spouse all my passwords if I don’t log in at least once every 6 months. 

Why does steam need to know if I’m dead?"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,If it doesnt belong to you then can you ask for your money back?
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Not if you write your passwords down and leave them in a safe.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Just give your family or friend your login and email I don't see the problem unless you suddenly die then I'm sure the last thing anyone cares about is your steam account.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,After I die there are still going to be Steam games I bought in a sale that I haven't started

I literally had to account for everything. Due to the volume of my collection (including rare cards). I also had to add a clause. Should my nieces have no desire, all my assets will be sold and put into a trust for  a house or college. Should they die before being allowed to acess the funds, and I have  No children. Everything will be sold and given to a church that helps the homeless and/or addicts.

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Buying games nowadays is buying a licence to access a game which is instead hosted on the company's servers. The clientside version of the game is just an access portal to the actual game code running on another machine. The game server requires money to remain in operation due to the cost of electricity, storage, data bandwidth and maintenance. Once a game ceases to be profitable, it is shut down. This cycle happens every ten to fifteen years at best.

As a result, you will outlive most of your games anyway.

Don't believe me? I'd be happy to settle the matter over a game of Overwatch 1 or Dawngate.

But for the few games which are old or kind enough to run on local hardware.... Civilised nations have a legally protected right to transfer these licences. For instance, the European Union has a legal protection for the transfer of software licences.

So you'd just ""give"" someone your steam password and username as part of your last will and testament, unless you live in a less civilised country where such things are illegal."

If I remember correctly it's often called your ""digital legacy"". Facebook, at least at the time, had a facility to nominate someone to manage your profile after death. By ""manage"" I'm fairly sure it meant download all your photos to preserve then update to say you've passed or something like that.

  


This was like 10 years ago or so she looked in to it. I'd be surprised if many more companies, including steam, didn't have a policy to handle deceased users by now.

It's almost certainly in the terms of service. Could very well say that you only lease games for your lifetime.and can't transfer. However, there are enough niche scenarios with parent/child shared accounts that I'd be extremely surprised if there wasn't an allowance to transfer things.

I know i don't own the games per say but their response rubbed me the wrong way

Steam said to my ticket:

""*I understand your concern however, Steam game subscriptions / CD keys are nontransferable and cannot be moved between Steam accounts.*""

The realization that i pay full price for a ""game subscription"" f me a little bit. I mean i know it's an account on a platform and they could dissapear and i'm ok with that even if it's steam but still never thought about it like a subscription.

This is going to be a legal thing in a distant future. I bet some gamer will sue in EU or US and then the other will fall suit.

Sadly even for GOG is the same thing. Your account will die with you but ofc the same thing argued for steam works for gog too ... sharing the login.

Edit: I thought about messaging GOG to see what they say and i think they convinced me to switch:

""*Hello,*

*thank you for reaching out to us.*

*As this is a particularly delicate matter with little to no existing legal guidance on the issue of video games preservation, we'd like to address it properly, so that you, and every other GOG community member, can be sure what can happen to your games in case of unexpected events, such as death.* 

*As you may know, GOG does not collect information sufficient to truly identify a particular person (such as name and surname) or their family or marital status. For this reason, we are not able to establish that someone is related to a particular user or that a particular user has passed away.*

*In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable. However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account, the digital content attached to it taking into account the EULAs of specific games within it, and that specifically refers to your GOG username or at least email address used to create such an account, we'd do our best to make it happen.*

*We're willing to handle such a situation and preserve your GOG library – but currently we can only do it with the help of the justice system.*"""

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Why do people care about this so much. If somebody you know dies are your first instincts actually to go play all their games? 
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"A lot of people are missing the point here. The issue is that you can't transfer your legally owned digital games via a will when you pass like you can physically owned things. If that's the case, do you truly own the digital games you bought?

If it's not transferable, then I'd argue no you don't. I mean to me it was already obvious. In my view, you aren't buying games on steam, you're buying a license to play the game via steam. You bought a license, not the code.

I can give my physical copy of ff7 for the PS1 to my sister, friend, etc. when I do that, they own it now. They could do the same for someone else. If square enix goes under, I can still play it via a PS1, PS2, PS3, or hardware that can emulate it. I still have access to the physical copy I bought. I can make a backup of the disc (which I have) so that even when my copy succumbs to time, I still have it. I'm legally allowed to do so **by law** and nothing sony, square enix, or any other company involved with the development, marketing, past release, or current releases of ff7 can do about that. Not unless the law was rewritten.

With digital games, you have none of that. You can't give or lend it to someone. Yes you can family share, but if steam ever closed up shop, you'd lose access because you can't connect to steams servers to download it (would also kill family share as well). Many games on steam use steam itself as drm, so even if you had it downloaded, you'd have to find a way to bypass steam to launch the game as many game executables require steam to launch to launch the game. Along with that, while copyright law does allow someone to make archival copies of physical media, **digitally downloaded media does not get the same treatment**.

So unfortunately, none of us own any of the games on our steam library. We purchased a license which gives us access to run the code, but we don't own the code itself."

3. Most things die with you.
4. All the things you care about - your wife/children won't when you're gone.  Every collector, hobbyist, etc. would be horrified to see that the kids... pretty much they don't care about your train set that took you 50 years to build, or your collection of rare Elvis records or whatever.  Pretty much they'll keep a token item or two, and then sell off the rest to someone who IS interested in that.

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I actually wonder what the legalities of this kind of light identity theft would be. When it comes to identity theft cases it's usually the person whose identity is stolen who sues. Of course any party who has a damage would be theoretically able to sue but I am wondering whether a court would actually find any damages on Valves side. Another problem with such a case of stolen identity is that identity theft requires that you use someone else's identity without his permission. Of course a permission is not explicitly given here but if it's part of someones will that you receive the Steam account which is bound to his identity, one could argue that this is an implicit permission to use the identity for this specific purpose."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I feel like people are making this bigger than it is. Steam is just saying they won't transfer an account from someone once they are deceased. How would steam go through a process of confirming someone's death and confirming the new person is someone they wanted the account transferred to. It would just be a headache for them to deal with. 

In the meantime, just writing down credentials and changing account details to a new person works. Once steam has accounts over 100 years old, they might make some rule to delete those accounts if they aren't used for a certain period a time. But if an account is still being used, it will be in steams' interest to keep it so more games are bought."

As for whether an LLC can own licenses, yes but it depends. For instance, it is encouraged you have your LLC buy commercial software licenses (for things like Photoshop), because it is a company expense and can be paid before taxes. However, note that you do need a commercial license for an LLC to own it, not just a personal license. That is how Photoshop is. But a program like Logic Pro; they only have one license and it serves both personal and commercial purposes. Whether you buy it as a person or an LLC depends only how you wish to sort your taxes out.

This depends entirely on the product and in the fine text of their terms and conditions, so it varies on a case to case basis."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"100%. I had a near death experience a few years ago. While I was dying, I wrote Steam support asking how I could transfer my account to my next of kin after my death. Some doctors wouldn't think I'd make another month. I got the same answer that everyone else did. I can't describe what that felt like. The thought of passing my games on was one of the few comforts I had in a very unpleasant time. To have it ripped away from you in an instant by some grunt behind a keyboard is indescribable 

After I recovered, I switched to GOG as much as possible. I took a hard drive and locked it in a safe with my entire collection. My next of kin will receive those, regardless of if they want them or not

Any disillusionment I had of ""Good Guy Valve"" was shattered in that instant. They're not your friend. They're a greedy corporation that will steal from a dying man because, maybe, just maybe, they'll make 50 cents selling portal 2 to his kids 20 years from now. That's all that matters to them. Not you, not me, not ownership. Money. Nothing else. I may not technically own my GOG games either, but I can pass them on if my next of kin wants them. That's far more than can be said for Steam"

We in the digital age are robbing our children of that inheritance. We owe it to our children to lovingly share and pass down our passions just as our parents did for us.

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Valve is <400 people and practically operates like an indie company. There is no consistent rule enforcement like you would see codified and followed to the letter in a big corp. That's a double edged sword, but that is a discussion for another day. The point is, the person who happened upon your ticket decided to do you a favour. You rolled a dice and won this time. Next time you might not be so lucky."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"That would do absolutely nothing. Steam accounts are non transferable. If steam finds out you died and left your account to someone it would be banned. Shitty ik

So you're better off just leaving them the password and 2fa access like the other person said and idk maybe a note that says to never admit the original owner is dead or something"
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Only the person activating the game license on their account is allowed to “own” the game. There’s nothing to leave and there’s no legal recourse you can technically leave it to a person in your will or estate but due to steam tos they will ban it if they ever realize someone else is using the account.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,It's a breach of terms because the account and the licenses are non-transferable. It's not your property to give to anyone else.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,I'm pretty sure Steam has a [game cafe account system](https://partner.steamgames.com/pccafe) for exactly this reason...

Maybe I'm wrong but someone would have to actually read those things to prove it."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"> IANAL, but an LLC is technically an artificial person, and for all purposes of all the law can be treated as such.

Absolutely not. Corporate personhood is what's known as a *legal fiction*, meaning we all know it's untrue, but treat it as if it's true *in very specific circumstances*. There is absolutely no such thing as ""for all purposes of the law"" for corporate personhood. Corporations cannot be held responsible for crimes, for example. They can be held civilly liable - they can be sued. That's the primary reason corporate personhood exists. In most areas, they are not treated like people under the law."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Given streamers tend to have an llc when they get an influx of cash I imagine they would be the legal source to talk to about game licenses and llc.
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,That’s a cool thought and all but Steam accounts are non-transferable so you’d have to start a fresh account under an LLC - you can’t give your existing one to a new LLC legally.

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Well that would be something if steam was still around in 100 years
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Can second this. There was a post awhile back about a dude who had been using his deceased brother's Steam account, something went wrong and he had to contact support about an issue with a game, and when he revealed he was using his brother's account, the support agent was forced to permanently lock the account.

Steam is usually pretty lax with the whole ""service, not goods"" thing, they don't really care if you ignore steam to launch games without going through their launcher, move the game to a different hard drive, play offline, whatever -- most single or local coop games you buy on Steam, you can run without Steam if you need to, some even if you've gotten banned. But their ToS is pretty black and white: *accounts and games are non-transferable*, granted to the specific person and subject to being withdrawn when deemed necessary, and if you literally tell them you are breaking their ToS (or are caught cheating and/or involved in money shenanigans), they won't ignore it, and you could find yourself without the ability to play any of your games that require online access.

That's pretty tame in the grand scheme of things, but you can see how ""games are a service, not a good"" can go wrong when you look at how Blizzard handles Overwatch. Did you buy Overwatch 1? Too bad, it's *gone*. You *cannot* play Overwatch 1, your license to play it has been revoked. Blizzard shows how a service can vanish based on the whims of a distributor, even towards users who violate no rules and followed ToS to a T. Hell, Chinese players can't even play Overwatch 2, because due to an expiring contract with their Chinese contacts, Blizzard can't run OW2 in China, removing access to a game they once invested time and money into.

We can see how this world of ""licensed gaming"" can be much different depending on who's running the show. This is a big reason why so many people push for DRM-free games, as even if you are 'buying a license', in practice you will usually be able to keep the game as long as it survives on your hard drive."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Which is exactly the problem with today's video game economy, and literally everyone should denounce this bullshit.

Get your congress to actually think about this subject in the context of ownership and figure it out."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I think they term they use is a ""license."" Steam sells you a license to play the game. The license is what game developers and publishers give Steam distribution rights for. So yeah, as per legislation, the right term for it is ""service"" and not a ""goods,"" and in the software and tech world we started using the word ""license"" to be more specific."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,way back in the day I bought a physical valve game and got a code which forced me to make a steam account and download it so was it a good or a service
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Software, for a long time has been a good. You were always able to hand someone a floppy disk or a CD and a key and they then owned that copy. This BS with software as a service has only started in the last like 15 years."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Pretty much this. The steam agreement states that you are only a subscriber to the steam services and that valve owns everything you purchase. In return you get a personal non-commerical license to use the software according the user agreement
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,It depends on the country. In the EU they are sold as goods.

You see, that account was made back in 2012 and the story goes that the owner died in a terrible Spicy Pillow incident while logged into the Steam store. It lay dormant for months, but then suddenly games in his wish list were being bought, achievements unlocked, and screenshots shared.

The activity waxes and wanes based on how close it is to the day of his death, growing stronger and stronger until…

Yes, one thing ive heard complained alot about is steam deciding on adult games. Adult game devs will get a game unapproved, resubmit it with zero changes, and have it approved. 2 different games with the same level of adult content will end up with one approved and one not approved.


It seems like they just leave the approval process up to whichever person is in charge of it that day. Just cross your fingers and hope the prude isn't working that day lol."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Yeah if you buy individual game licenses for a cafe environment all the licenses are null and void anyways
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,That is actually really cool.  Huh
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Absolutely, most games give just personal licenses. Most games go with a standard format for licenses; big companies like Nintendo who can afford a legal team will of course fine tune the wording in the documents.

I should’ve been specific. Personal vs. Commercial licenses for games are different. I guess I went into the two to give an example of why licenses differ on a case to case basis. But anyways because I did once look into obtaining a commercial license and permission for a video game, I do know a tiny bit about it.

For most streamers and such I don’t think you need a commercial license. BUT If you want to produce a Machinima show like Red vs Blue, then you need either a commercial license, or permission from the game company. Setting up and arcade as well, needs commercial licenses. (As you are just a vendor of the game, not a consumer of the game)

As for using an LLC just to be able to own the games, you might need some kind of internal reason or company objective, which explains why money was spent on these games. For instance, you have plans to develop a game in 10 years, so naturally you need to buy games for your research. It doesn’t matter if you never end up making the game, you can always say you tried and failed lol. So long as it is recorded somewhere in the minutes of the meeting. (just as an extra precaution)"

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Also not a crime. TOS violations that benefit the user and that doest harm people is something pretty much everybody should do it if they can get away with it, specially if it is from a corporation."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Don't trust it though, test it. Steam in the last ten years has retroactively hijacked the runtime libraries within the game installs it downloads, swaps it with clone files which also does some steam.api calls, which wont let the game launch if you do not have steam installed which if it is, has you log in and then will deny you playing said game because its not from the same account. Actually I think it even rejected me one time because it was from a different windows install when I tried to force that to work by logging in the correct account."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Basically any game that relies on a server to work, such as MMORPG or other online only multiplayer games are lost forever the moment the company that owns its right decides to pull the plug."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Makes 0 sense even from a service level. Why would the brother get banned from an account he has access to. Does the account belong to the person who created it, the person who's used it most, the person who's last used it, or the person who's card was used for individual purchases? My account, created for me by my brother when I was a child 20+ years ago using one of his emails, uses mine, my parents, and my girlfriends cards to purchase games. Who owns the account?

 It's impossible for them to even prove who's account it is, his or the brothers, as long as he has access to it. If he doesn't have the login than he might as well be a hacker trying to access it through support, which would make sense, but if he has the credentials, he owns the account."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"This is the right answer. The license agreement was always there, even in the old times with some floppy discs, later with CD's and DVD's, now with downloads from Steam, you always have the license. And this license is usually for yourself, not for other people.

The publishers still have power, like with the multiplayer games, they can shut down servers which makes some games unplayable, but that's just written in the license agreement you have to accept when you buy and install it.

The licenses usually also contain things like in the old times with physical copies, that you were not allowed to use such versions for rent, you couldn't charge anyone else money and give him the copy for some time, that wasn't allowed.

For movies, like DVD's, the licenses do not allow that you show the movie in public, which would be like a cinema theater.

You can also own a license just for some time, like with subscription models for MMO's and other stuff. 

I'm not sure if you can legal transfer the licenses as kind of inheritance, i don't think so. I mean, you can of course just let someone else access the account, but just like some people here mentioned, when it gets known by the support, they can lock you out."
1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"It's sold service to the individual, wouldn't be surprise if they van accounts for good every 100 years."

Parents will amass a ""priceless"" collection related to their hobby/interests and they leave it to their kids in their will.

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"Yes and people are also overestimating the permanence of physical digital items. I have been playing games for over 30 years now so probably a lot of people don't have this perspective but even games where you own physical copies have effective shelf lives. 

My old boxes full of floppies are completely unusable for me. I don't have any drives that can read them anymore. Even for things where that's not the case, like old CDs, they become largely useless for software compatibility reasons. Try slapping a Windows 95 game into your drive and see if you can get it to run - probably not. And soon optical drives will be gone too.

The only real way to play a lot of old games is to pirate them, even if you already own them. Your kids will get no more out of your boxes of Blu Rays than out of a Steam account that gets locked."

1czx8j9,2024-05-24,2024-05-27,"Except I can't. I don't have a Windows 95 machine or a CD drive. I've updated my computer to move with the times.

None of my hardware is compatible with Win 95, so I'd have to hunt down an antiquated machine just to try and play the software.

Even if I had one available, I could encounter some kind of problem and then it's also ""tough titties"" because I can't get any tech support for long dead hardware and software.

If the CD gets scratched I'm fuxked, unless I create an image of it on my disk drive and take up pointless space on my HDD on the off chance that I want to play it again.

I could create my own emulation of the software but that's time and time is money and arguably piracy."

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,God forbid someone get a tattoo because they like the aesthetics of it or it represents a period of time in their life. Not all tattoos have to remain relevant for 60 years.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Way to be closed minded. There are plenty of scenarios where this tattoo would mean more to someone than you're taking at face value. Also it's well done and looks great.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Or maybe some beautiful art about a boy trying to rescue his sister?
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Haha ya it took me a while... I'm replaying it right now actually and I'm stuck on one part I can't get past. Clearly my memory is not so great.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Limbo is quite a bit deeper than the game itself. Just like lord of flies and catcher in the rye were not just a story. Even for people who never played the game you get an idea of what the tats about. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Seriously.. It was a nice game, but ultimately quite forgetful. Why get a tat of a game with nearly no replay value? (Ok, why get a tat of a  game at all, but that's beside the point)"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Yeah, I'd only ever do this if I was directly involved in its development."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"This isn't a normal 'oh it'll become blurry because of age' comment that you usually see outside of /r/tattoos. The buildings in the back don't have black lines to hold in the colour, so it's way more likely to start 'bleeding' out. The owner of this may get lucky though."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,This tattoo will age just fine.  This is an opinion from someone with a decade of experience.  Contrast is in all the important places.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,It's an eerily beautiful title. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I found it really dull. The gameplay is pretty basic and unless you're completely engrossed by the artstyle (admittedly it's fairly unique and ambient, but I didn't find it enough to carry the game) I don't see what one would get out of it. It takes like 2 hours to complete, so probably worth picking up in a sale if there's a chance you'll like it as much as the people who rave about it."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Agreed. Anybody know what system(s) this is on?

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,I was just thinking how *odd* it was that the boob was perfectly framed inside the photo.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,TBH i don't think it matters if its from game or not as long as it looks cool. As a games who knows this game I can appreciate it more but it's awesome enough for a stranger without gaming knowledge to like it too. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,My rule of thumb is that the time it takes to get the tattoo should not be longer than the game.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"White ink looks great when the tattoo is fairly new, but it's usually one of the first colors to start fading."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,it's because white fades extremely fast. I believe they will need to get that touched up frequently for it to maintain this look. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,White always just looks like scar tissue when I've seen it.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I can't even count the number of ""tattoos"" I've seen on the internet that were actually magic marker or paint... but this one looks like it might just be really fresh (swelling / bright white ink)."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"It's fresh, it'll fade out a little bit, although it looks like it's in there fairly well. Source: am tattooer"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Yeah kinda what I was thinking. I thought the pic was taken in black and white or applied a filter or something until I saw her upper arm (practically the shoulder) being a skin tone.

Now I know people get sleeves all the time, so their arms can be totally coated in ink, but if this is a real tattoo, all that stippling needing to be done to get the ""misty/foggy"" look must've been incredibly time consuming and painful, considering the level of detail and contrast to the black. That last part alone makes me think its body paint instead, and was airbrushed or something "
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,I'm convinced 90% of strange or awesome tattoos on the internet are body paint.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Everyone's bringing up the white, but I think it's the black on the body/head that looks most suspicious.  Not saying it isn't possible, but that is incredibly crisp and dark."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,I don't think there is much white ink being used as its just a solid black and grey
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Hopefully it is. Who would want a limbo tattoo?
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Nope definitely a tattoo. Looks like the only straight up white they used was in the eyes and highlighting features like the thing he's standing on. White as a highlight isn't so bad and will always stay a bit more noticeably white when alongside a dark contrasting color. The background was pulled off well with an off white/grey for the lightest area. So nicely done! 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"That's awesome, also a great game."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Do you spend much time or /r/tattoos ?
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,That looks horrible...

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,yeah I thought it was great too but I wouldn't get a tattoo of it on my body
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Limbo is full of the typical ""mysterious"" ""depth"" you see in indie games that try to look deep by having an unclear/no storyline.  

It's dead easy to create the impression of depth, and most indie game makers do exactly and only that. Creating real depth is much much much more difficult, and is quite beyond many game makers. Most of the ""deepest"" games only just touch on real depth."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"lol, replay value plays into tattoo worth now?  Seriously what?"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Like the art style?

I have no issue with the concept of simply putting a beautiful piece of art on my body.

I have a lot more of an issue with putting the name of another person on me then a piece of art I think is beautiful. In fact I have a lot more of an issue with putting the name or symbol of a sports team on me then I do with some beautiful art. My opinion on what art I think is beautiful is far less likely to change then my opinion about a person, sports team or something else; but this is just me, you likely have a different opinion :)"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I mean, maybe it has less to do with the game and more to do with the subject. 

The character is this young boy lost in limbo looking for something, I believe, and the imagery and background associated with the tattoo are more likely to be the reason for getting the tattoo as opposed to ""I really like this game I want a tattoo of it"""
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I'm gonna assume you weren't there in the beginning when everyone was trying to find the eggs.  It was a very memorable and enjoyable experience for me.  Still one of the best indies to come out, imo.  The replay-ability comes from finding the eggs and trying for no-death runs, speed runs, etc., if that isn't your cup of tea obviously you won't find any replay value.  There is very limited replay value in every single player game."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"That's not true.  You don't need black lines you only need contrast.  Also grey wash doesn't really ""bleed out"" a black line is more likely to expand than greywash.  R/tattoos spreads a lot of misinformation."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Black lines to hold in the color? I don't think you understand how tattoos work. 

It's not a 'coloring inside the lines thing' it's ink suspended in your skin. 'bleeding' in tattoos is from ink settling in your skin, and it's more likely to happen extremely if it was done too deeply, or went over too many times."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,As long as it is covered and has sunscreen if it ever sees light should be okay ish but I'm not a professional
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I'll take your word for it. I've only had second hand experience, but I've seen the result of similar images not aging very well."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"in things artistic like design, painting, and creating ads etc, ""reading"" means whether or not something is coming across to the viewer.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,It's without the doubt the most amazing game I've ever played. The ending...just blew me away.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,I love everything about the aesthetic of the game but overall I agree with you. I've set out to finish it several times and have always lost interest before the end and I am a platformer fanatic.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"XBOX Live Arcade, Steam (Mac OSX, Windows, Linux), PS3 are the platforms I think it is on. I got it on Linux and it can be very unstable, though."

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I really don't think it's a circlejerk. It had style, plenty of hard puzzles, atmosphere and humor (remember spider?). 

Originality? Well, there have been a few similar games, maybe afraid of the dark (didn't play that far), but I think it's reasonably original these days. I think it was a very good game.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,If you use the good ink your colors should stay looking as good as new unless it's on a joint. Joints always need touch ups no matter the color. Unfortunitly tattooing is often done with less expensive ink that stay bright for a few years if that. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"None of my white ink has faded in fifteen years.  Depends very much on the artist, and the quality of their ink."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Usually tattoo artist will tell you not to get white because of this reason, but personally, I really love the way white looks. "

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,It's just fresh. Fresh tats always have that deep look you can't otherwise replicate. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"The main problem with that tattoo is the lines, Skyrim was not a cartoon, none of the characters had outlines.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,Very true. You're brain will actually perceive lines or edges down the middle of two neighboring shades of gray/black due to lateral inhibition. So even if you don't draw black lines your brain will still perceive edges due to the contrast.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,To be fair I had been told that outside of /r/tattoos but if that's the case then fair enough!
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Like I said to the other guy, it's how it was explained to me when I first started getting tattooed, so I guess the guy who did it wasn't clued up himself haha."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"This tattoo would require more care/touchup work to keep it looking good, yes. And the shading required to achieve the effects of the buildings might not be easy for every artist to replicate so you would want to go back to the same guy or someone similar. But as long as you take care of it. nbd"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"huh,  so I do like reading after all.  I'm gonna add that to things I like to do."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Really? That's odd. Are you sure?

""Getting a read on"" something is referring to tracking isn't it? As in the Death Star got a read on Alderaan and blew it the fuck up.

Either way it's easier to just use other words like ""that's going to fade and be hard to make out"". Reading implies there are words to read."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,No.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I stopped with the whole, ""every tattoo has to have a deep meaning"" bullshit.  I give the artist a general idea of what I want, now and let them have at.  "

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"""I thought it looked cool"" is pretty retarded, retard."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Idk man I'm usually a pussy with pain. All my tattoos have just felt like someone scratching their nails on my skin. The only one that actually hurt was my inner elbow and that wasn't even too bad.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I think the location of your tattoo is more likely to result in pain. Shins are usually pretty pain-tolerant compared to fleshier parts of your body. 

Shading hurt on my tattoo just because of the sheer amount of time it took, I started to feel really raw at the end of it. Mine was on my shoulderblade, and overall it wasn't too much of a sharp pain, just a dull one like a bad sunburn. 

Don't know about the white ink =)"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,"The only reason people say white ink hurts more is because it's the last thing you do, and by that point the skin is already pretty raw."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"The color doesn't do anything. Line work however does ""hurt"" more because of the the of needle, angle of attack and line work moves the needle faster so you get poked more. Shading and color are usually much softer and the needle moves slower."

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,And how he tried to whisper things in your ear but had to yell it to the neighborhood because you couldn't hear him
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,You're implying that it's going to look stupid when she's old. I'm implying that we with tattoos aren't going to care what a tattoo looks like when we are old. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"""Wow breasts sir"" isn't a joke haha. It's being weird. Girls have boobs, we all know this. No big deal. "
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,How's summer vacation treating you? Any family trips to the beach?
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"It doesn't really ""fade"" or ""turn yellow""... when the tattoo is fresh, the top layers of skin are damaged (basically a big scrape from the repeated puncturing), and the ink saturates the skin all the way to the surface, so you see light hitting the ink directly.  Then the tattoo heals, scabs over, new layers of skin are deposited over the ink, and the scab peels/sloughs away (anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on the depth of the ""injury... usually for me it's about 2 weeks).  When the tattoo is fully healed there are a couple layers of new healthy skin overlaying the ink which is locked in subdermally. Whatever color your skin is will tint the color of the ink reflected back when light hits it. For darker, more saturated colors, this effect is less noticeable.  But usually you'll notice that blacks are never quite as black as they were on the day of tattooing, and the same is true of whites. 

Probably this photo was taken by the artist for their portfolio *right* after the session when it was basically still a fresh wound.  Or she has extremely pale skin (but I'd put my money on the former).

EDIT: if you lightly scrape/scratch a healed white tattoo, you'll see the white color brightly again, until it heals.

EDIT2: [here's my arm right after a session](http://socialskinstattoo.com/bryan/extra/brian/), pretty much everywhere you see ""white"" ink in that photo just looks flesh colored today"

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Not always true. Treatment during the healing process and the sun can definitely fuck up a good tattoo.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I'm sorry, I dont mean to be condescending, but that's pretty basic English. It isn't even my first language :/,

Reading can be a synonym to interpreting and perceiving, just much as it can literally mean understanding of written language."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"""read"" can simply mean ""interpret data"". It is not constrained to written words, though that is the most common usage.

""Do you read (me)?"" is an inquiry often used to ask if one is heard or understood and ""I read you"" is just an affirmative response that means one can understand what the other is saying.

""Reading"" a file on a computer is to pull in bytes that could represent anything and are not tied to characters/words.

As the previous comment mentions, ""read"" in visual design/art can mean communicating the purpose/message/intent of the piece."

And then when it's used for something that has even less artistic merit, such as a clickbait article on gaming, it just sounds goofy. It mostly seems to apply to things striving to be ""serious"" as well; you would never call a press release a ""piece"". Or ""Hey look at this piece my kid drew at school today"".

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,The game is a feels train. 
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I really liked it. It was a little short for 10 bucks, but it had some interesting physics based puzzles. The events leading up to the game and a lot of what you see during the game is left to your imagination. Kind of like reading a book. "
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Yes, the game is a lot of fun and somewhat challenging. imho, I wouldn't want a permanent reminder of it on my body for the rest of life.  
I just wouldn't want to explain what it represents 20 years from now."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"It's a really fun/exciting game for sure- but it's also easily one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, aesthetically speaking. There were several occasions (many of them involving the gigantic spiders) that I would jump out of my chair while playing. I'm getting a bit of an adrenaline buzz just thinking about it."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Well at least it's the kind of tattoo that in the eyes of the majority of the population, they'll have no ideas it's from a video game and they'll just think it's an artsy tattoo."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,I don't like the game at all but the tattoo is cool and to be clear I'm not a big puzzle platformer guy so I don't really like it because of that not because theirs anything wrong with the game I heard it's beloved.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,No.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,Does it matter?
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,Demo?  Someone took the plunge and got themselves Limbo inked for life.  It's $9.99 on Steam with an 88 metacritic rating.  I think you can spare a few pennies a day to save up and buy it when it is 95% off during the next Steam sale.
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,"Maybe this was the perfect moment for the plunge.  You don't take it lightly.  Maybe this was the first game this person ever finished because they loved it and it did pack that much meaning.  People get all sorts of tattoos.  Appliances like toasters, microwaves, blenders.  Tattoos of Dwight Schrute.  I guess all things considered, a tattoo of Limbo is better than the name of your girlfriend or boyfriend - Limbo will always be Limbo."

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"God forbid you recommend a tattoo to someone also. I did once when someone asked for ideas about something that might complement a piece they already had. 

People got all over me telling me I should never make recommendations about other people's bodies and how they should be allowed to get what they want... AFTER THEY FUCKING ASKED FOR ANYONE'S INPUT. 

That's honestly the shittiest sub to comment in though. Tell someone their tattoo looks nice and someone will tell you're wrong and that it'll degrade heavily. Politely tell someone you don't like it and get some snarky fools telling you not to judge based on other people's preferences and just being all around unpleasant. 

"
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-08-10,"It all really depends on well it's looked after. Don't forget sunscreen, touch it up whenever necessary, and keep it moisturized whenever it's covered. That's all I do and mine looks absolutely fine after 5 years (I don't have much as of now though to be fair).

This tattoo shouldn't look any worse than any other as long the owner keeps up with it. "
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"ANY reputable artist will do free touch ups.  Unless you abuse the privilege.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Most of the artists I know are free touch ups for life, and rarely inflate their rates if you're a good client.

This is how I end up with tattoos that are occasionally janky for a few years because I got them at apprentice stage, then fixed a few years later for 10% of what their hourly is once they get really fucking good."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Ok, I would use the word ""work"" there instead of ""read"" though. That way it works (reads???) better."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I wouldn't call ""to read"" basic English in terms of an abstract concept. Reading an animal's tracks, for example, is probably confusing to an entry-level English speaker who learned ""to read"" as book-related.

There's a few words like that with a fairly direct meaning and an abstract one, and most ESL materials I've seen emphasize the direct meanings at first."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Don't worry, it's cool. It just doesn't make sense in the context of a tattoo. If you can't read a tattoo, the tattoo has words in it."
2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"Thanks!

>""Do you read (me)?"" is an inquiry often used to ask if one is heard or understood and ""I read you"" is just an affirmative response that means one can understand what the other is saying.

Yeah I actually use this one or at least hear it each day at work.

>As the previous comment mentions, ""read"" in visual design/art can mean communicating the purpose/message/intent of the piece.

This was the confusing one to me. Someone apologized for being condescending while telling me this is common knowledge. It isn't."

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-24,"I don't recommend that, when the scrape heals you'll probably have visible scars/lines. 

a) you risk losing a bit of the color, and then when the skin heals that spot looks lighter

b) the tattoo needle(s) are super fine and as long as the tattooist doesn't go too deep the injury is on a very ~~macro~~ micro level with very little scarring... when you scrape yourself at a macro level on, well, almost anything, it gouges out a larger area of skin and the scars are usually visible.

I've got tiny scars from something like scraping my arm across a nail/screw during a house project, that didn't even draw blood, but leaves a faint visible line.

If you really want your tattoo to look new again have your artist do some touch up to saturate the skin more, so the ratio of ink vs. skin reflecting the light is higher... but really just accept the fact the healed tattoo will *never* look as fresh as it does right after you get it.

2blkmh,2014-07-24,2014-07-25,"That's really unfortunate then.

A big part of getting a tattoo is doing your own leg work.  Finding the reps of shops, checking portfolios, making sure everything is up to snuff at the shop.  A good shop will never shy away from telling you what brands they use, how they clean and stuff.

This should be basic knowledge for anyone interested in getting work done."

Like any industry, eventually there reaches a point where the lingo is so dense that outsiders can't understand it. With tattooing, once you know the parts of the tattoo machine and some basic ink stuff, it's still pretty transparent to the outsider. ""Read"" is just a thing they use instead of ""translate"", though they use ""translate"" as well."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"This is awesome, but as someone who started getting tats 13 years ago I can tell you you'll have issues with blending/blurring over time.  Regular touchups and keeping it out of the sun will be key.  Awesome art!"
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Did everybody just come in here to say how it's not gonna hold up well? I mean you're not necessarily wrong or anything but I mean....it's already been said a dozen times this thread you know?
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,No that guy is tightrope walking. Doing the Limbo would show the character going UNDER the rope or bar with a bent back. Psh 0/10.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,I forgot about limbo!
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Listen, fuck the debate about the game fuck the debate if this tattoo will look good in ten years. Matter of fact, fuck all this shit. I'm just glad you got a tattoo containing good work of something you like. 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 as for the rest of you. 🖕🏼"
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,how do you like that side boob?
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Those mounds on the side got me
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Yea, that looks good now, but it's not gonna hold up well..."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"You could have told me that was a fabric sleeve and I'd have believed it. It looks like that, or the artist has intentionally added a fabric texture to a game that I believe didn't have it.

Really though, isn't it fabric? What else would the black thing by her shoulder be - it's not in position to be a bra."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,very impressive

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Tight!
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Loved the art style of this game and the gameplay was just as great! I'm kinda jealous of this tattoo. People always think of cool ideas before me. 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"I know nothing about what this is supposed to represent, but it is stunningly beautiful"

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Love that game
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Maybe it just wasn't my type of game or maybe I just played it way too late, but I honestly didn't enjoy Limbo a whole lot. I was expecting it to be incredible due to the cult following it seems to have but I just didn't really like it that much. Cool tattoo though. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,I should go back and finish playing that game...
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Is this game worth $4.99 on iOS?
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"i've never seen a tattoo shaded to this extreme before. i've seen a few sleeves, but this one takes the cake in detail. radical!"
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,I love tattoos with amazing depth.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Beautiful tattoo, and I don't understand why the ""it'll fade"" brigade felt the need to overtake this. It's conveniently not on your arm, bruh. Mind ya business. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,that is a tattoo actualy worth having
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Just about the first time I have seen a tattoo and thought I would like one.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,So in love

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,You misspelled side boob.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Cool. Good work

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,That's gorgeous. 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,holy shit thats amazing

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,This is nothing less than amazing!  I can't imagine how it will hold up over the years but for now it's art!
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"I think I like this, but also I think I don't...I'm stuck somewhere in-between."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Definitely read this as Limbo Link... 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,The kid is standing on top of the pole... I thought the whole point of limbo was to go under the pole!

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,No shit. I just bought this a few days ago on Steam to see the game before I bought Inside.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"I'm normally not one to care about tattoos, but man that's fucking cool."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,That is super impressive.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,That must of took a long time to ink and $$$
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,You're lucky. My skin turns black ink dark green for some reason. That would have turned your image into a kid in a bottle of absinthe. Which would still be cool. 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,I'm doing a video game tattoo right now of mostly Nintendo characters but I'm sure I'm gonna add him in somewhere. Love that game 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,That looks amazing.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,>2200 upvotes. 65 comments. My question. But why. Why this cartoon game is chosen to be on a person's arm for upto 50 years.i can't understand it.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Impressive ink, side boob not as much. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,What a beautiful tattoo of a mediocre game 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,That tattoo is going to become the biggest gray blob of all time in like 2-5 years. 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Will look like shit in five to ten years

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"I don't know about these kind of tattoos. It's a cool game, but will this be a cool tattoo in 20 years? With tattoos it's usually better to get something more timeless.."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Gonna be a gorgeous blob of grey in 10 years.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,This is dope.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Nice tits perky
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,I didn't think this game was that great.  Is it REALLY tattoo worthy?

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Is that Even limbo?
Or perhaps that is Inside?"

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"nice image but not appropriate tattoo material imho. 

plus, in this case the skin as canvas adds nothing to the final art work. just my opinion; these things are highly subjective, of course."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,You should definitely try out Inside if you haven't already.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Doing that no-death run is a crazy accomplishment.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Dark Souls?!
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Cool game, but i wouldn't tattoo it on me, i think there are many better games that deserve it more.

Also, really? Try playing Dark Souls."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"To educate someone who knows nothing about tattoos, can you explain more?"
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Everyone is saying this but it won't be that bad.  The black ink will barely fade whereas the greys will soften.  This will create separation and more contrast over time.  Also it's very large so ink expansion won't be a big issue.  It could have been done with more longevity in mind but it most likely won't turn into a ""blurry mess"" either."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"This was originally posted 2 years ago, I wonder if we can get a current picture of it."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,You can always get it touched up.  It's a beautiful piece 
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,She'll definitely have to keep that out the sun.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"There are no bad tattoos, just happy cover ups =D"
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Yeah, great work, but she's going to have a solid black and gray arm in no time."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Going to have to get it touched up every so often mos def
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,My understanding was that if you go and get touch ups regularly then it will keep it looking fresh so long as you want. Is this not the case?
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Fun while it lasted though?

I really love the tattoo and the game and I'd really like to see how this tatt looks now.

Edit: edit: removed edit, it was incorrect. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Give it a few decades it will look like blahhh when she will be in the old folks home. Mine are 10 years old and I am 30. I wonder what mine will look like when I am 80?

People get tattoos for their own reasons; this game means something to this person - it is special and important to this person - and they memorialized it with a tattoo.  Doesn't matter if other people understand that or not.  "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Because it is their body and because they can. A tattoo doesnt have to have a global meaning for a person to want it. Hell it doesnt have to have a meaning. Also in 50 years it will likely look like crap and the person wont care how it looks or what others think of it.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-09,No shit. I got about half the way through it when I died. I then spent the next three months in the psych ward.
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Limbo is much more difficult if you avoid guides. The game doesn't hold your hand and genuinely makes you feel like you solved something. 

It's level design is on par with Portal in the sense that puzzles feel really organic. 

Dark Souls is try until you can't do it and Google an exploit to get around an obstacle. 

You can't do that in Limbo, you either fail or succeed. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Wow, what an amazingly douchy response. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"I believe as you age and your skin loses its elasticity tattoos lose definition.  
  
All the subtle shading is going to be a lot closer to just one shade of black.  
  
That old guy you know with the faded, blurry tattoo on his forearm? It used to look a lot better."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Not an expert either, but faint shadings like that with no real outlines tend to just fade and bleed into one another as the skin heals, especially if the skin is exposed to much sun. You can get it touched up, but the skin can only take so much inking before it starts to scar. Tattoos like this look great, just not for long. This is why the norm for tattoos is to have very heavy outlining. "
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"As you get older, the ink spreads out"
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"According to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0B7F5UbTOQ) awesome video, the ink is getting faded due to the fact that white cells actually treat ink particles as the ""enemy"" so slowly over the years they crush and eat big particles of ink.

TL;DR white cells eats out your tattoo ink."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Here is an example of what sometimes (and probably will happen for this tattoo) goes on.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Everybody's skin is different. I had people telling me not to get color tattoos because ""they fade"" and ""don't look as good as black and white"", but I said fuck that, I like colors. I still have people asking me if my tattoos are fresh almost 10 years later. It also depends on the artist, if they fuck up your skin, the colors won't take properly. Plus, tattoos arent the same as they were 60 years ago. There are different types of ink and new tattooing techniques which you never saw back in the day. My tattoos will probably hold up better than somebody's grandpa who got his in the navy."
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"To be fair, the sun is bad for all tattoos. You need to use heavy sunscreen if you want it stay good looking, but even then it's still going to fade. Prolonged exposure to the sun is bad for skin in general."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"Most people never get regular touch ups.  They get the fresh tattoo, maaaaybe come back for a touch up session after it has healed, and then that is it.  They may roll back into a shop 10 years later and ask for someone to clean it up but by that point, it's not going to look like it used to.  

You're better off accepting that it is going to fade and change over time, it's inevitable, rather than coming in every year for a touch up."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"I ended up not really liking Limbo a lot.

It felt hard for the sake of hard.  Like, everything was designed to kill you at least once, even if you are careful.  Only a few things were obvious dangers, everything else simply wasn't intuitive.

The best example was the level with the crushers.  You have this giant contraption that will obviously sqish you, and in the middle is this thing sticking out that looks rather obviously like a button.  After spending trying to clear it all without tripping the button, I resorted to Youtube and discover that the ground around the button is what kills you.

And then the very next one looks exactly the same, but this time the button is actually a fucking button and it works the complete opposite, and the way I though the first one would.  Like how the fuck am I supposed to know that 2 identical traps work the opposite way?

It was crap like that.  So many completely unpredictable deaths.  You basically don't know how anything works until it kills you.  It just felt like a lazy way to increase the difficulty."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"You're right that the ink will spread over time. But the old guy with faded tattoos also has a lot to do with how the needles worked back then. Without capacitors old tattoo guns had a varied depth of penetration into the skin based on electrical surges. The deeper the ink in the skin, the easier for the lymphatic system to beak it down. Modern tattoo guns have more uniform movement so it's easier for artist to keep the ink more shallow in the dermis where it can hold its shape and location. It also has a lot to do with sun exposure. Keep a physical sunblock on it, and it'll age a lot better. 

TL;DR it'll fade but not as badly as old sailor tattoos."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,It is a fact hat colors fade faster than black ink.  But yes like you said everyone's skin is different and it will hold longer in some.  Also the people who told you not to get color are dumb.  Unless you have a certain skin type/pigment (and your artist should be able to notice this) then that fading won't happen for decades of the tattoo is applied properly.

Not to mention, a lot of artists are mixing their own grey wash, and not all artists are buying top dollar black unless they do a lot of this type of work. 

It's not real wise to walk around telling people their 75 grey shade tattoos will look good some time on because with most people, and most artists, they won't. Ditto yellow or gold. I've got a lot of work from a lot of sources, and when exposed, the gold goes first, followed by the yellow, and then the lightest grey.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,"We can go deeper. This is what I think it's about, based on theories I've read from other places and from my own interpretation. I won't go too in-depth, as you can find more points about this interpretation online.

[I see the game as the act of a person going through chemotherapy. The full game is based INSIDE the body of a person, with each level being an area inside the human body. The game starts with the boy in red being injected into the body (chemotherapy), and he has to attempt to reach the cancerous cyst within (the blob at the end). Anyone attempting to capture/kill the boy, is the body's immune system trying to get rid of anything that doesn't belong within the body - in this case chemo. The scientists having contained the blob is the body's attempt to find a way to get rid of this cancer, and with the chemotherapy's help (the boy, the player), the scientists (also part of the body's defense) find a way to get rid of the cancerous blob for good (they even help the blob escape). This is shown with the powerful scene in the end where you as the blob crash through the outside trees and escape outside onto the beach - the only place in the game that has any natural lighting.
](/spoiler)

[Now, with the alternate ending, where you manage to shut down parts of the factory/city/bunker (the lit orbs), you're actually the chemotherapy killing the body, one part at a time. And as you turn the last lever in the alternate ending, you're ultimately killing the body, the person, you were sent in to rescue. So while many regard the alternate ending as the 'good' one, where you manage to shut down the factory, free the controlled people in line (symbolizes the bloodstream), it's actually the bad ending, as you're killing the system... the body.

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,That's not true.  It's not opinion but fact that black ink stays better over time.  Initially it appears to fade because while it heals the irritation making it look darker goes away.  Over an extended period of time color certainly fades more than black.

His skin wasn't wrinkly, it was just the tattoos weren't done with the same level of detail and they didn't have the coloring techniques commonly used today.

I have a different opinion.  I appreciate a lot of body art, but really only the unique work that people want to be theirs.

>10 years or less, depending on how they are done. 

Even the best best tattoo artist cant control everything.  The parts that make this tattoo look so well done now are the parts that will be lost later on.  The fine detail of the rope/vine he is standing on.  The eyes will probably blur to light faded spots.  The gap between the feet will lose detail and blur.  Most of the background will fade into a less distinct mass.  Good portrait work is not overly complex in details and the few complex details it does have are the ones that fade into subtle highlights.  This tattoo, while well done from a standpoint of recreating a picture, does not have that advantage.

I know this in part from personal experience.  [This](http://galleryoftattoosnow.com/KaoticEnzymesHOSTED/images/gallery/Killcrow-\(Large\)1.jpg) is my leg and done by a stupidly amazing artist.  But that subtle farm/barn/tractor background looks nothing like that now.  You can still tell what they are but just barely.  I knew that going into the tattoo and was fine with it, as it's not the main focal point.  But even the detail in the scarecrow itself is now hard to see."

56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,At least you tried :)
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Yep. What's happening is that there are immune cells (macrophages to be precise) that recognize the ink as foreign and ingest it with the intent of getting rid of it. They tend to move a short distance before dying and depositing the ink in a slightly different place than it originally was. Repeat many many times over many years and you end up with a blurry tattoo
56gdna,2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Do you think as she ages it'll become clearer like a Benjamin Button style tattoo?

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"It would be interesting to take this idea in a different direction.

When I first saw the gif I assumed it was a metaphor for depression or mental issues. The kid was at a birthday party but in his world it was dark and terrifying. Definitely a bit more sad but a really interesting concept if you played through the game. Limbo has always been a game that left you searching for a deeper meaning, which was very much intentional:

>The developers at PlayDead Studios have gone on record saying there is no official meaningto Limbo or its ending, making it ripe for personal speculation. The only sanctioned story is “Unsure of his sister’s fate, a boy enters the unknown.”

I think it would be cool to see a video that played with the idea that it was a kid trapped inside of his own mind. "
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Thank you the video has no point without the twist.
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,No wonder it was so familiar. I knew I've seen it before. Dorkly makes some good shit

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,I recently replayed Inside. I knew the parts with the creepy water child were coming but sure as shit I freaked out when they showed up.

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,They just released Inside. Give them a year or two 😁
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Little nightmares almost feels like a sequel in many ways.

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-18,"They made a game called Inside. Similar idea, you may like it "
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"Try Inside.  Same studio I believe, very similar feel."

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,That game was so interesting 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Originally it was launched on consoles like Xbox and PlayStation. Around the same time as super meat boy. Translating the controls to a smart phone or tablet can understandably be sometimes difficult as seeing the entire screen is pretty necessary for 99% of the game and quick precise actions can do a lot to ensure your success. 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"I originally played Limbo on an iPad. The controls worked just fine for me, though the later platforming segments are a lot harder and require precision which the controls didn't help. For the most part, though, it was fine and precise enough to play through and enjoy. "
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-18,The controls are fine on ps4.
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"You're a Redditor, Harry!"
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"Except... I think it would have been better if things weren't all rainbows and blowjobs when lit up. More like... death, rot, and Satan."

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Limbo is a critically acclaimed Indy game that came out a few years back.
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Well gaming on a device made for gaming has its perks mate. Stop gaming on a Phone or tablet and stuff like that will be a complaint of the past. 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Lol yeah you gotta play it right. I played it on 360 only demo and immediately after had to buy the full game. Lucky for me they gave it out for free and I had none of those issues. 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,Your honestly really stupid 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,lol I think it has something to do with how we perceive the world. I haven't played the game in a while.

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,First time I'm seeing it. 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,There is a game sort of plays with this concept about a blind girl who sees the world by listening to the sounds around her and getting close enough to touch things.  You hear things like cloth flapping in the wind and she'll think it's clothes on a line then get closer and realize it's a scarecrow.  That sort of thing.  It's called Beyond Eyes.
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"> I think it would be cool to see a video that played with the idea that it was a kid trapped inside of his own mind.

There's a short horror game called [Among the Sleep](http://www.krillbite.com/ats/), which is about a 2-year-old. It's not quite ""trapped inside his mind"", but about how things look different to a child. I'm also reminded of an old point-and-click game called [Sanitarium](https://www.gog.com/game/sanitarium), which is about an adult man."
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"Trapped inside his own mind? Why, that's Alan Wake!!"

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,When I played it I thought he fell out of his tree house and died and his spirit had to reach his sister because he wanted to see if she was ok. Then he realized he was dead when he reached her because she doesn't acknowledge you. 
6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,This reminds me of the lore of Five Nights At Freddy's. I haven't followed it in a very long time because the fandom got out of control but I believe the whole story is told from the point of view of a child who got bit by a malfunctioning animatronic at his birthday party.

People tell me that a person can´t be a school fitness test but I don´t care, I´m beautiful. Every morning I wake up and tell myself ""The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds"". My running speed starts slowly but gets faster every minute. In school, every time I hear the bell I think ""A single lap should've been completed, and if It isn't completed twice the test is over"". From now on I want you guys to call me Fitness Gram and respect my right to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. If you can't accept that I am a aerobic capacity test then you're a testophobe and you need to check your running privelage. Thank you for being so understanding "

6bzlq3,2017-05-18,2017-05-19,"Buckle up and I'll explain what sister location, FNAF world, and the book brought to the table. This is from years of following the series passively, game theory's newer videos, and the FNAF subreddit being on my feed.

The book introduced the two inventors and founders to Freddy Fazbear's,(FFP) one of whom is the purple guy, William Afton. Now this fucker has a thing for killer robots, and he's been killing kids with robots since day 1 of FFP's existence, maybe even before, but we aren't sure of that. Now he had two kids, a son and a daughter. Oh yea, should establish that FNAF 4's locations are right above the sister location building (which is a secret underground research lab for building and testing the new robots)

Now the events of the FNAF4 minigames happened and all, and the son got bit, and eventually died. the ending where the kid is told ""I will put you back together"" is actually hearing it from purple guy, his father. His father always knew that his killer robots would get haunted and start killing on their own, however this time he wanted to do it on purpose. so he used Sister location to build new robots that would kill children *specifically* so they would get haunted, in some sick effort to bring his son back to life. However his dumbass daughter goes up to one of the robots, Baby, and gets slaughtered; even though she was told not to approach the fucking robot.^(don't get in the fucking robot shinji) 

Which causes purple guy to follow through the events of sister location, and be manipulated by the robots to help them escape the building. ""how do robots escape a building to be set loose on the world"" you may ask.

Well strap in because we're getting more wild. There's this thing called the scooper, which rips out the internals of the robots, and after the protagonist scoops all the robots, an amalgam robot named Ennard ^(literally their innards) is born, and manipulates the player up to the scooper, which rips out all his organs and Ennard climbs in and uses his body as a gross rotting skin suit, from which they commit more murders ""cause that's what they're programmed to do""

and Springtrap is actually Ennard inside purple guy's corpse, which makes for a nice bit of irony that they got stuck in a damn robot again

Oh and the other founder of FFP was murdered by the robot Baby as well

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Seeing as there are a lot of questions I'm going to clarify a few things -


The Bundle games all come in one Steam Key so - Sword & Sworcery, Limbo, Amnesia, and Psychonauts are all included in that one key. If you own any of these games on steam already activating the bundle key WILL NOT give you giftable copies of those games. So those asking for people to gift you individual games your out of luck.


For the extra game - Bastion - it has its own Steam key but be aware that in the past when they have added more games for paying above the average after the fact they tied it to the already existing extras key. So giving away Bastion at this time might screw you out of getting extras that they may add in the future. That said if you want to gift it to someone dont redeem the code (it wont expire) and wait till the bundle is over to know if its safe to give away.

Also you have to pay more than $1 to get the Steam keys for the games."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Is anyone else having trouble receiving the key email?

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I almost soiled myself until I realized I own a copy of LIMBO and Bastion on XBLA and Psychonauts and Amnesia on PC.

I really want Superbrothers though, is it worth the price of the bundle?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Wow, this is an amazing bundle! And I only have one of the games! I've already just bought it, but do these activate on Steam?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Darn, was only looking forward to bastion and it just had to be beat the average - prized."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,The soundtracks alone are worth at least 10$.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I've been thinking of getting Bastion and Psychonauts, but now I have no choice."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This may be the best humble bundle I have ever purchased.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,BEST BUNDLE EVER... but i already have EVERY GAME. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,BEST FUCKING HUMBLE FUCKING BUNDLE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I just jumped up and ran to the computer to buy this. I don't think I have ever got my credit card out so fast before. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"God Dammit i knew i shouldve waited to buy Bastion. I picked it up last Christmas cause i figured there was no way it would hit the Humble Bundle. Awesome Bundle though, Instantly bought it!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy shit! This is the best one ever by a LOOOONG shot, and it's had some sick competition."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Well f*ck, I just bought Limbo and Psychonauts in the last month.

Stupid life."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"EPIC! :)
i had some money left on my paypal account, and paid 15$...
i feel a bit asshamed, that the other windows user just paid 6$ in average, mac 8$ and linux 11$. Great deal, always wanted tu buy bastion and almost done it a few days ago, but now the deal was awesome :D:D"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"~~Got an extra key for Bastion from the bundle in case anyone wants it.~~

Edit: Key taken"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,The fact that I lack a debit or credit card really upsets me when indie bundles come out. ;_;
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Damn paypal doesnt seem to agree with my card. Sucks to be living in a country where paypal is still a dirty word and amazon is a warrior tribe... :/ 

How long is the indie bundle gonna last?

EDIT: Nevermind, I'm blind.. maby I'll figue something out till then."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I have bought every humble bundle since the frozen synapse bundle and this is by far the best one yet!!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I've been cowering away from Amnesia since the day I knew it existed. Now I have no choice....
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"So, I'm currently building a PC and ran into a snag with money (moving costs).  If I pay for this now, can I download/use the games later and on a different machine?  I have no idea how the humble bundles work."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I'm glad they give me a choice on how much i'll pay to shit in my own pants from fear with amnesia. 

Underwear is expensive. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I just bought LIMBO when it was on the steam sale. Not a tad bit upset either (and I already own bastion - fantastic game). It helps good devs, good charities, and a good site. 

Going to give away the bastion key :)"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I'm extremely hesitant knowing I already own a few. Hrmm..
*Very* good bundle though."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,[deleted]
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already have all the games in this bundle but I HIGHLY suggest everyone who doesn't to go buy this bundle. All of these games are amazing. I'm not trying to be all super supportive of indies for upvotes or anything, It just that all of these games are amazing. The soundtrack for S & S: EP is amazing too."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I sign up for the emails, yet I always find out about these bundles on here first. Maybe I should reddit a little less."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Already got Bastion. Amazing game, one of my favorites. Would really like to try out the other games. I would totally buy this bundle, but I don't have access to paypal or any paypal supported debit cards :("
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Simply fantastic. I never thought that such a cool bundle will ever appear. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Damn, i have them all. still want.
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,7 bucks  in my account... Its fate.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is really the way gaming should be. I am quite pleased to be able to support this AND get what I've heard are great games for a great price.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Out of these games, I only have Bastion.

Still breaking the minimum, hell yeah! This bundle is so good!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Well, time to throw some more great games I'll never get around to playing on the pile."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I still haven't received a email for the download link. I messaged them but got no response and payed over the average. What am I suppose to do?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is one of the best humble bundles I have ever seen.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I just bought Bastion+soundtrack and LIMBO within the past week...Psychonauts is on my wishlist on steam...Why in the hell did I not know about this sooner?! Although you can keep Amnesia. NOPE.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This will be the forth time I have purchased psychonauts.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"ugh i'm dying here, process my order!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"A couple hours in and it's already reached 450k, fasted selling indie bundle yet? 

There's great reason too, fucking incredible games. Hell even if you own the games, I bet most people don't own the soundtracks.

I'm not sure what the total value is but I'm guessing its at the very least 50 bucks. It would be insane to not at least pay the average for this."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,how little can you pay to still get it?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,[deleted]
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Best humble bundle ever!!!! But I bought limbo yesterday :-( 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Nice deal. Paypal is being a piece of shit right now though...offering 1 USD for 1.07 CDN when the exchange is 1.03.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Guess this is my chance to take the dive and try Amnesia. Wish me luck.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Wow. I don't have... everything except Bastion...

I MUST GET THIS.

Of course, I will pay more than the average and donate to charity, I'm not a cheapskate. Just a regular college-level cheapskate.

Edit: Fuck this shit, $10. I'll just wait longer to buy that Pratchett book I wanted... $5 to charity, $4.5 to developers, rest as a tip."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Alright so I have a spare Bastion key now, does anyone want it? First to PM me gets it.

EDIT: Given away"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Damnit, why are you ruining the second hand value of my mint Psychonauts for Xbox? :S"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy shit, this is the best one of these ever."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"This is amazing. Seriously the best bundle BY FAR. I don't care if you own ever game already, it's worth picking up just to show support for the Humble folks.  

*Sucks I'll be broke until the average purchase price shoots through the roof.* "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Easily the best Bundle. Paid 20. If you have not had the pleasure of playing Superbrothers Sword and Swocery, get your best damn headphones and strap in for a visual and aural orgasm. 

As for you cheapskates out there, pay above the average, it's fucking Bastion. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Already have Bastion and Psychonauts but I bought it anyways.

Just Bastion by itself is worth 15$. Such an amazing game and experience.

The folks over at Humble Bundle do such a great job.

Totally impressed, :D!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Instabuy. 
Though about paying a penny - Dick move, basically stealing. 

Thought about paying a dollar to get steam keys -  5 amazing games for a dollar? Gota giver more credit that!

So I payed double the average. Damn you bundle for being so good. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,First humble indie bundle that both is full of games I don't already have and really want.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Whoa. Limbo, the reason I bought the bundle IS NOT CROSS PLATFORM. I didn't buy it for any other reason than to play a native version of it on Linux and I feel duped. I really feel duped and I am quite upset about this.

I already own Limbo for Windows on Steam but I really wanted the Linux support. I am mad about this, anyone else?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Anyone else not getting their email with the download link?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I love that Linux users are the most generous and Windows users are the cheapest (check the bottom of the page).
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep

Apparently the 5th game isn't too bad itself. Yeah, this is the best bundle I have seen."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"My favorite humble bundle yet! Pay over the average! Bastion is more then worth it, plus its going to a good cause! "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is indeed the best humble bundle so far IMO.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yay , got my codes. Hope everyone else started getting theirs as well. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Psychonauts you say? I MUST HAVE IT!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Looks like I'm not the only one not getting their key in the mail... I really wanted to play bastion :(
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"This bundle is full of win, I can't wait for the next one."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I've got every humble bundle since the 3rd one, now I can't get this one because I'm broke and jobless and hey charge more for steam keys :( This looks like the best one yet, amnesia has been on my wishlist for like a year now. Already got bastion and limbo though. **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PAYING MORE TO RECEIVE BASTION!**

edit: just noticed it's only a dollar+ for steam keys, not even bad...still too much for me though, I only have 42c in my paypal :("
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I just bought psychonauts a week ago on steam, but I ain't even mad. i'll buy this bundle anyway. Maybe."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Wow, they've really outdone themselves this time :)"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,is there any way to buy this with no credit card / debit card?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Is it just me or is the whole ""instantly get your Humble Indie Bundle V"" not happening right now...

Oh wait, checked the card, it was pending :P"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Without a doubt the most spectacular Humble Bundle yet.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"***HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.***

This is the best thing that has ever happened to modern gaming (humble bundle generally, and also this bundle).

I want to randomly hug people, I'm so fucking excited!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I hope my laptop can handle all of these! Especially Amnesia, I really want to play it.

Who can't afford about 8 bucks for these awesome games?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"As noble as they seem, I'm starting to feel like these indie bundles are going to start saturating the indie market soon, making it difficult for new developers to sell anything...

"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,[Just got home and...](http://i.imgur.com/zuKcm.png) 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Just the other day when one of those other bundles came out I thought to myself, ""Man, these indie bundle things are really going to crap."" And then today happened......"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"For those interested, be aware of the [Indie Game Music Bundle 3](http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/) going on right now as well."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy testicle Tuesday, those are some great games in one pack :O"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"After 91 minutes of just LIMBO, this is already worth every penny. Gonna wait for Bastion to finish downloading now to have a go at it. I'm also looking forward to ~~absolutely never~~ playing Amnesia!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Hey, can anyone here help me out a bit? I just payed $8 for the bundle and I'm really excited to play. How long does it take for the keys to be sent to my email? is it instant or does it take a few days? Thanks."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Also this bundle is the most money I've ever spent on the bundles. I'm usually the fucker that only pays like 1 dollars or less, but this time I threw down 10 bucks, short on cash until payday, and when that day comes this bundle gets more money from me!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Bad freaking time for me to get a job. I don't own any of these games and know that I do I won't have time to play them!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I pirated Bastion and Limbo... Needless to say, I bought this bundle to own them. :)"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I didn't have **any** of these games...      I squealed.
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Where do 8,000 downvotes on a bundle of games come from? I still don't understand how each and every reddit post gets a downvote, and in the case of buying video games in order to both support developers AND charity's that help people, where do 8,000 people get off on downvoting?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Just hit $1 million in purchases. That's awesome!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,[deleted]
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I'm pretty sure this is the best bundle yet.
The first couple were epic.. this one goes beyond epic into awesomely-epic territory. :)"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I'm no gamer, but this is awesome!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"...great, own all but bastion and sword & sworcery... freaking A... If I could claim the steam key and get the games I already own as giftables I would be more willing to pay for this...


...well, its charity, where the hell is my wallet."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"and it can be added on steam.

almost making me feel like a thief. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy shit! I'm never fully aware of things like this, but this bundle already contains three of what I consider to be the best games ever MADE. Can't wait to try out the rest.

**TAKE MY MONEY.**"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Bought 3 copies at 10$. I love this idea, never played these games, gonna gift them out (to my friends) and hope that other developers see this. 

Edit: yes I bought 3 copies, and already gifted them out to my friends, I really should reconsider how I write my posts. 
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,That has to be one of the best theyve ever done.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"how do i access the soundtracks in for the games? If anyone could help i'll be very grateful.
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I feel bad that I only spent $8 :(

im a terrible person -_-"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I am absolutely floored by this. I just recently got a laptop capable of handling PC gaming, and this appears?

As weird as it's gonna sound, I feel so proud of the developers and thousands of contributors for even doing this, and for such a cool cause. This is awesome, Limbo is the only game I've played, so I can't wait to start my PC gaming off right. Thanks Humble Bundle!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Now that I have a job, I finally beat the average! feelsgoodman."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy Crap, I almost wet myself playing Amnesia!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Already own all these games but still going to buy this.

Best indie bundle by far I doubt they can ever top this one."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I didn't own any of these, and I had to look up what Child's Play was, but I put 10 bucks towards them. Did a 40/40/10 split for devs, charity, tip."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Can't believe LIMBO is getting no love.  Creepy, dark, and some really edge of seat type gameplay.  "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Welp, 2 weeks to try and find some way to buy this. Watched a few of PewDiePie's videos of Amnesia and I wanna try it so bad."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,none of the 3 options will accept my pre-paid credit card :( Sucks this is the best bundle ever
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I've not played any of these, i'm excited.

May as well use the bittorrent links they provide, to save them expensive bandwidth."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Is anyone else bothered by the fact that despite thinking this is so awesome most people are valuing it at less than a pint of import?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Bought it for $15! ^_^
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,Looks like they are doing an AMA tomorrow ... [Tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/humble)
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Reddit is a shithole.  Move to a better social media platform.  Also, did you know you can use ereddicator to edit/delete all your old commments?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,I know this is for charity but I really can't afford to pay more than the average for bastion :( especially when it's the only one I don't own. Why do you all have to be so generous?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,let me get this straight...I can pay whatever I want? If I chose to pay $0.01 (that would be a dick move) I could. That is awesome.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Goddamnit I wanna buy Bastion again, but Double Fine doesn't deserve money at all..."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"I'm not sure which one's used, I think one of them isn't.  Try it.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"I had never heard of such a thing before, probably being fairly new to reddit and all. So i go down to pay, and it let me enter a custom amount. so i put in a penny to see what it would do, it accepts that.. So naturally with the genrosity that was given by the devlopers to support this charity, I gave half my weeks pay in generosity back."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Have heard a lot about Amnesia, but I'm not much of a pc gamer. Installing now, gonna play with lights out tonight.

Edit: Nope."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,Question: How do I go about adding the games I bought to my Steam? 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"hm hmmmm hmm hmmmm hmm hmm hm hmmmmmm ""I dig my hole you build a wall'"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Never played any of these games. Googled Bastion and the graphics bring me back to the old days of maplestory (somehow). 
Amnesia is the only one I've heard of.
I got it, and I'm wondering - would my xbox 360 controller work with this?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,HumbleBundle my ass. This should be renamed to HolyshitfuckAwesomeBundle. Time to shit myself in fear tonight playing Amnesia (again)!!!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"I've been wanting to play psychonauts for a while, it's a shame I could only pay 50 cents, paypal only had 77 cents in it, wish I could have paid more."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,WOW this is great. Just purchased my first Humble Bundle because of it.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Hope someone will read this. I just bought the bundle for above average (just for bastions soundtrack), now where do I find the soundtracks?? Thanks

edit: Found it! Just click your download link and select ""Soundtrack"" where it is set to Windows."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,How much do you guys think this is worth? I'm really considering buying it and probably spending about 10-15 bucks on it. (I mean hey it's charity and some really good games) Is 15 bucks a good amount? 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Hey, I usually have bought the bundles in the late stages, and a lot of the time they add new games and stuff in part way through. So my question is, if you buy the bundle early on, and later they add more stuff, do you still get the new stuff? Thanks. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"You sir, are a legend."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,This is some good shit! I might have to buy it even though I've already got all the games except Bastion. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"why does humble bundle not send me the emails about this, i have bought 4 of them so far, with my email in it. oh well reddit is here to save the day :D thank you!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"i own all of these except for amnesia, but i bought this for the bastion soundtrack aside from anything else. 

so uhh.. do I click to download bastion and download the whole thing to get the soundtrack or what?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,Sorry for being a noob but do i need Steam to play some of these? Because when I try to start Limbo it crashes always right after I start it :(

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"The only way this deal could get any more awesome, is if they add HiB 4. 

I bought the bundle last night at $ 10. Even though i beat the average, I felt like I robbed them, so I ended up buying two more copies to give away to friends :) "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Anybody else buy it, then get a blank screen for Psychonauts?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"They need to change the name, this is NOT a humble bundle. The Majestic Indie Bundle perhaps?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Humble Bundle: making Indie Royale look like an incredible ripoff since 2010
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I bought it but it won't give me my key! Resender won't either. Gahhh I want to play.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I'd pay $15 just for Bastion's soundtrack
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,If only there was someone to narrate this bundle

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,worth it if i own everything except amnesia and sword&sworcery
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,FFFFFFFF I spent a grand total of like 50 bucks to get all of these games already. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Like always HIB show ""the others"" how to make an incredible magic...

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I had everything but superbrothers. I can at least give Bastion to my wife since it is a separate key, but it's too bad I didn't get giftable copies of the other games. Oh well, still worth the cash just for the soundtracks and to help HB out. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already own Limbo, Bastion, and Amnesia... Bought it anyway."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Wait, is this for NA only? Or can I change into Euros somehow?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I hope the games they add a few days into this are just as good, if they keep up that amazing tradition that is."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Any of them games are worth the average on their own.

Buy now people!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Google Checkout refuses to work for me..  Missed the last 3 because of it, tried paypal too, same story.. I really wanted Psychonauts and Amnesia, already bought the others trough steam.

TL;DR Swedbank sucks..."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Amazing Bundle! I only had Limbo out of them all and planned on buy the rest when I got a better Laptop. This just made things a lot cheaper! 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Thank you
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Best video yet. I do kinda miss the ""DRM Free, Support charit-ee"" half-rap line, though."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"great bundle. just as good as bundle 4
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I have a question about paypal, I have an old account with 8 bucks, but paypal doesn't let me buy the bundle, or anything else, unless I tie a new credit card to the account because my old CC is dead and I don't have another one. They fucked me with that money, right?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already have Psychonauts, I bought LIMBO yesterday, and I have Bastion on Xbox... and it's not nearly enough reasons to not get this!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Why wasn't this earlier. Still though, the soundtracks are great!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I just had the greatest deal of my life and nobody will know of it :(
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,OMG OMG OMG OMG! Bastion has been tempting me with its sexiness on my Steam wish list... And who can forget Psychonauts? Best bundle ever.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Wow, payed $30 and didn't even get the code, hope that goes to a good cause..."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Is there anyway to get it to convert into GBP? Im broke at the moment and need to spend as little as possible (typical, bundle ends 2 days before pay day) and knowing how much exactly to get bastion would be useful"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Awesome, altough getting a key is a little slow, but it is worth the wait"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Damn, quarter mil already. Take that, doubters."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,What are the chances HIB4 will be included as a bonus eventually ? I'd love to grab both in one go.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is the best bundle ever. Just popped down $50 for this. Such a good cause as well!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Every last one of these games is WELL worth it. If you or someone you know doesn't have at least Bastion or Psychonauts, you need to give them this pack. Now."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"This is the *perfect* bundle. It comes out right as I - by coincidence - am about to buy Limbo and Bastion. My only regret is I already have and have finished Amnesia. I'll be forcing all my friends to play it, though."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,annnnnnd bought. i'm hoping that Super Brothers is fun
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Wow this is amazing. I was hoping Bastion would be in one soon. I wouldn't have expected Amnesia and Limbo in there too though.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,YES! Now I can play Bastion and Amnesia
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"$6.39 to scare myself so bad that I hide under my desk for the next two nights straight?

Yup, in for one."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy crap, this is the best indie bundle yet."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Every time I see Amnesia on sale for ~$5, I always place it in my cart, then chicken out and take it out. Now I have no excuse and I finally own the game that I'm looking forward/not looking forward to playing. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I own all those games (as one should) but if you don't, you *have* to get this. Every single one of those games is brilliant."

Darn."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I wish that the Steam keys would give you extra copies of the games you already own. It is kind of lame that you can't trade off the duplicates.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Damn, this is such an awesome bundle. If I hadn't just paid everything I had to fix the stupid car I'd be buying it right now :( Well I have two weeks, right?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Wow, this looks like a good start to PC gaming now tht I have a computer. Now to go dig up $10-$15"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"This is the first one I have just snap bought. Ive been meaning to get Psychonauts and Amnesia for a long time, and any time I can support the people who made Bastion is A-OK with me!

First thing Im downloading? The Bastion soundtrack. Seriously guys, give that a listen if you havent already. It's amazing."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Never bought a humble indie bundle before, but this is too good to pass up. I also feel strange for paying hundreds of times the minimum price."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Oh man. I would so buy this if my PC could run Amnesia at more than 10-15 FPS. If anyone can help me, that'd be awesome."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"That feel when you own all of them except for Superbrothers. I'll probably get it for that, and pawn the keys off on one of my buddies later."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I really wish they could use Steam Wallet for these...
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Think these would run on my Lenovo X220? None of them seem incredibly demanding, computer-wise, but I'm a dumb console guy."

I'm going to wait until they add more games like they do most of the time."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Best. day. ever.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Bestest bundle ever made in the history of humankind .
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Listen to the Bastion sound track! It's one of the best soundtracks for a video game ever.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"If I own three of these five games and I buy them all, can I gift the three games I already own? I mean i'm gonna buy it anyway for the two I don't own, but i'm just wondering."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Take all my money. I was just wanting to play/purchase Amnesia. Now I get all these awesome games :D
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Already bought bastion psychonauts and limbo last month but buying this just for Amnesia.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I KNEW waiting to play all of these games was a good idea... I'm so buying this when I get home from work.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is fucking awesome
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Anybody know if I can purchase this through safari on my iPhone?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Is this the best 15$ that I will ever spent? Never heard any of those games but still bought them.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Can someone explain how this works?  It seems like I can pay 1 cent for all these games except for bastion.  Is this how it works? 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Dammit, I just got Psychonauts off Steam like YESTERDAY.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,What does this mean?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Question: Would it be frowned upon if I paid little for this bundle but more for the next one?  I'm strapped for cash right now, but I really don't wanna pass this up."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Should I have gotten an email right away with the games in it once I donated?  Cause its taking a while to show up. Maybe Im just too impatient.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Amnesia is now on my steam list.. I am going to pre-apologise to my drunk self.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I've never bought a humble bundle, is it possible to split/gift the games?  Basically I own LIMBO, Amnesia and Bastion while my boyfriend owns Psychonauts and Superbrothers. It'd be nice if we could get one bundle and each get the games we don't already have."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,An amazing bundle! Luckily I don't have any of these games yet.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,do i want to play amnesia? i've seen what it does to people... and i've played a bit of penumbra...
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I have not played a single one of these. Consider this sold 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,can i buy it and NOT get amnesia? i feel creeped out even downloading it.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I would pay 10 dollars just for the Bastion Soundtrack. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,great humble bumble
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already have most of these on separate systems, but now they will all be unified HOLY CRAP IT INCLUDE THE SOUNDTRACKS!!!!!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is a HELL of a good deal.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I already own one of the games. Is there a way to just gift that specific one through steam when I buy the whole bundle? 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Some great games there. Some will probably be surprised by how awesome Superbrothers is. A beautiful game that deserves as much praise as the other games listed!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Yet again does not having a job or money screw me D:.  Worst is I only have superbrothers on my iPhone (parents pay for it but not video games) and none of the others.  Oh well on the bright side I'm graduating from high school on Sunday and I can find a job (hopefully) soon.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,ARGHFRGLBLAHH!!! I just bought Amnesia on Steam for 20$ not two hours ago!

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,What I would really love is some of this stuff in vinyl. I remember talk of the Bastion OST being printed on vinyl. I can dream..
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I feel like i should give money even though i own all these games
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Fuck I want to buy this so much but being broke sucks ;_; Oh well
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Why isn't Visa enabled?

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I'm really hoping they add more games as time goes on. They usually do, and I love it. I guess I'm just greedy though. :D Already a fantastic bundle! "

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I told my little brother if he gets good grades I will purchase him this bundle since he's been a lazy little prick in school recently. Definitely some of the best games I've seen in the bundle.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Was gonna buy all these but the sword one. Back around Christmas time. So glad I decided to wait!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Best Humble Bundle ever, by far.  Too bad I own everything in it already.  Actually, on second thought that's great because I'm flat broke right now and would feel awful if I missed out."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I'm getting this just for the Bastion flac soundtrack. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I still don't have any of these games and HOLY SHIT.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Can't I get this for free technically?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Why don't they include the payment option PaySafeCard? I see these awesome bundles and I'd love to play these games. But there is no way for me to give them my money! :<

And I already own these games..."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I can't believe my computer can't even run LIMBO... I guess I didn't think the graphics were too advanced. I need to have at least Shading Model 3.0. :(

Oh well, charity and all that."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This will probably get buried and sound like a rookie question but can I purchase this on my laptop and then transfer the games to another computer in the near future?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I've never played any of these except on my friend's computer because I have a mac...I love all of them...damn you mac!

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Thank you parsarp and Reddit! Without you I would not have heard of this. Reddit success.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I feel bad for anyone who try out amnesia without any idea of what's in store. So many bricks will be shat. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I have $0.00 on my PayPal account. My bad luck
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Just came to say I would never have bought any of these games, but I was successfully wrangled out of $25 bucks. Well played!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I only have three dollars in my bank account and I feel bad because the average is seven dollars. maybe next time.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Botanicula is a good game too, (the thumbnail for this link) but it's not included in this one if anyone was wondering."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Soooo, from the comments I get that I'm the only one who never played any of these games and that they are the best games **ever**."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I really wish that there were a way to purchase past humble bundles. I have all of them except 4, which I really regret missing out on."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Bought one for myself, and another for my friend. Awesome deal!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"For anyone who happens to be on a slower internet connection, I just thought that I'd let you know that it's about 6 gigabytes. One of the games (LIMBO) is only about 77 mb's though, so they're not all big. You can choose to download them one game at a time or multiple at once, whatever pleases you. Happy gaming!!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is indeed a nice bundle.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,It's too bad I already own all these games however I have to say this is the greatest bundle ever.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I dont know.. Beat Limbo on XBLA (awesome game by the way!)Amnesia? NOPE. (thank pewdie!) Bastion? Never liked it, really.. (i know, smite me.) The only one i'm interested in would be Psyconauts."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Just paid via paypal but no link?, does it take a while to send them the links to you?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,am I just retarded or is the download page hard to find?

If I buy this bundle, but I already own one or more of the games, is it possible to gift those extra copies to friends?  Or do they just disappear?  

Thanks in advance for an answer, anyone!  Planning on giving em $10 :-)"

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Jumping on this for the soundtracks alone! Best bundle ever.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I hope someone's going to read this. I have a crappy laptop (Intel i3, no graphics card). Would I be able to run any of these games decently without having fps issues?"

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Since I already purchased Bastion on Steam I'd like to give my extra key away.  First person to message me gets it.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Bought the bundle for a small amount because I didn't really want bastion....Then I gave in and bought the bundle again for bastion and gave the left over steam code to my friend for the extra games.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"As someone who was a big fan of the Humble Bundle's for Android, I'm sad to see this one isn't on mobile at all. Wasn't that the direction they were heading in? Either way, I'm not gonna buy this one because I don't have the time to play these games on PC. I know I'm in the minority here, but I prefer to play games when in transit, and I'll definitely pay above average for the next Bundle that comes to Android."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Seeing as how I own psychonauts, limbo, amnesia and bastion I won't be participating in this one.

HOWEVER. If you don't own any of these, you are a fucking moron not to get in on this. These games are all fantastic."

Can someone tell me what that other newer side scrolling game is? Looks like LIMBO a little except you build fires, kill monsters, etc.

I remember seeing it a while ago, the second version of it I believe.  Seeing these indie games reminds me I want to get it."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"the bastion soundtrack is worth all the money in my whole bank account, this is easily worth the $15 I paid!"

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already have limbo and bastion but this is still the best indie bundle ever. I also wish i could have paid a lot more for than i have.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Huh, should've paid the extra couple bucks for Bastion. Wasn't thinking.  Oh well, still got Limbo, Psychonauts, and Amnesia.  Already had Psychonauts but it's worth it."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Not going to purchase as I would only pay $5 and feel a jerk. Hope those that do pay over the average. Great load of games!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"This is worth it alone for the Bastion soundtrack, *let alone* the actual game."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yo guys. I have 12 bucks on my amazon account, but I got it from a gift card and the only payment method I see is through credit. Are there anyways to pay for it using my remaining amazon gift card balance? Thanks

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already bought Psychonauts recently, which is a bummer, but I was planning on picking up LIMBO this morning ($4 on Steam), so I'm glad I held off. Now for just a few dollars more I get Amnesia and Bastion, which are two other games I've been wanting to play.

EDIT: Wow, Bastion is great. I just sat and played it all the way through, which is the first time I've done that with a game in years. Granted, it being short helped, but I really recommend spending the extra to get Bastion as well if anybody is on the fence."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I've got all of these, so I'm buying them for my friend I've been bugging to play these."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,The only one of these I have is Limbo (just bought on Steam for $3) even though I have Bastion for 360 it's such a great game I wouldn't mind playing it again! Awesome deal!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Wow.... this is amazing I'm buying it for my friend since i know she would enjoy this.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Enjoy all of my upvotes for providing me with an awesome night ^_^
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I'm genuinely excited to finally play Amnesia (the rest of the pack is really just icing on the cake). People have built it up as the be all end all of 'constipation relief' and I'm finally going to see if it lives up to it.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Didn't Radiohead already discover that this was not a successful way to make money when they released In Rainbows? I remember that you pay what you wanted to for it, but that KoL was not done in that fashion. That led me to assume they found it wasn't profitable enough. 

Regardless, very cool package and concept, I hope it does well."

Thanks for any help."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Of course an awesome bundle come out after my debit card gets deactivated. Unless this lasts for 3+ weeks I may have to miss this one.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Bastion is what really convinced me to buy this.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,If only the actual devs of Psychonauts ended up getting money for this - too bad they won't.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,...I and all my friends already have all of these games. :(

Once I've bought the games will they be unlocked on Steam or will they be directly downloaded to my computer. "

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I'd buy the shit out this if I didn't already own each game.

Such a good fucking game, looks like I know what I'm playing again this weekend."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"FINALLY! A BUNDLE WORTH PAYING FOR! 

I've ween wanting Psychonauts and Bastion for the longest time. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"My friend paid a nickle -.- 
Anyways, best 20 dollars ever spent!
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Now I can really say... fuck you, Diablo 3. Your 2 and a half weeks of being interesting are over, you have been replaced five-fold."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Good god. Best deal ever.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Bastion gets my paycheck. all of it.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,And to think I was about to pull the trigger on 2$ Limbo
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,well i didn't want to sleep anyway...
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Are Psychonauts and Superbrothers worth the buy? I already have limbo bastion and amnesia.
If I buy with mastercard do they also charge the transation?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"So much love for Psychonauts. I only just started playing a week or so ago, and man have I been missing out. I was turned on to Tim Schafer by picking up a copy of Grim Fandango because I'd heard my friends talking about it. Best decision ever."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Is there any possible way to get these on my PS3? I know at least Limbo and Bastion are on PSN...
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,They're making about $100 a second right now. I can easily see this topping the $1m mark before the end of the day.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"When I saw that these came with the Soundtrack, it made me want to buy the bundle (especially Bastion). Too bad I already bought Bastion and the Soundtrack. Best HIB I can think of. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Time to play some games!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"When do the humble bundles end? I would really like to purchase this, but at work til 4 am. Is it a multiple day sale?"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Damn, I already spent my spare cash going to the doctors. I can spent a penny but then I feel like I am ripping them off plus I wouldn't get Bastion. Which I heard was a good game."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Is Amnesia as scary as it looks?
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I only managed to give $6, i am a student but i start my new job soon so i'll be spending a lot more there! :)"

My facebook friends will love some keys too :)"

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I have never bought a humble indie bundle before. I actually don't do PC gaming very often, but seriously this is a powerhouse list of games.  No way I could turn it down.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Limbo is awesome
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Anyone know how long the games are available for download from the site? Reached my data cap so in the meantime I will just register the steam keys.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I was about to buy limbo on steam and then I see this! Awesome
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I know very little about Amnesia, besides it's supposed to be scary, and it made Day[9] pee his pants.  I am going to *only* play this game at night to get the full experience."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,This is easily the greatest bundle ever put together. I don't think they can ever top this one in terms of all around greatness.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Quick somebody lower the average, stupid dollars are too expensive and Paypal takes 2 days to get the money I sent, I won't be able to get Bastion :("
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Holy shit, I must clean my pants and clean my wallet and donate as much money as possible."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Play psychonauts first. Classic game nobody played from the Xbox days. I even used a controller to simulate the experience
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"You are a very lucky man.  All four are great.  Well three of them are great, and one of them I actually can't play because I live alone and I need somebody to hold me after 10 minutes of it."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I have finals next week, and I just bought the bundle having never played any of these games"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I've never played any of them either, but I'm always hearing about them on reddit, so I figured it would be a worthy buy. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,[deleted]
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I already have most of the games in it, but I bought it anyway.  As far as I'm concerned it's $15 very well spent if it means more like this in the future."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,The previous ones were great but this one blows them all out of the water. I already own all the games but gave them $25 anyway. Worth it just for the soundtracks.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I agree, holy crap.  Psychonauts, Amnesia and Bastion are all very (very, very) good games and easily worth their full retail price. Sword and Sworcery is not really my cup of tea, but I can see people really liking it.

Don't have Limbo yet (so I am getting the bundle) but from what I have seen it looks fun.

The Humble Bundle people constantly outdo themselves.  I am very impressed."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Definitely, those are all massive indie games, and I really wanted to play all of them. This bundle is going to make a lot, I hope :D


I would even dub it not just the best humble bundle ever, but the best indie games bundle ever."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,At first I was like OMG Amnesia! Totally worth the bundle cost. Then I read the rest of the titles and came to the same conclusion as you. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I just have Bastion and been wanting to play the other three so safe to say, day = made!

P.S. Let's not forget Sword and Sorcery now, I heard its a rather underrated title."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I had thought they had been going downhill.

Then I saw the kid from bastion.  Then limbo.  Then psychonauts.  

Took me a minute to process.

Then I realized, that good as it is, there are ways they could improve the bundle.  Here are my suggestions

-Include minecraft, either another temporary trial like they did for a previous bundle, or the full game

-Pay 2x the average, and you get downloadable ringtones of the Bastion narrator explaining that someone is calling

-Pay 3x the average, and you can claim that ""Psychonauts"" is a story of your childhood

-Pay 4x the average, and you can claim that ""Bastion"" is a story of your childhood

-Pay only a penny, and Tim Schaffer will track you down and redecorate your house like the ""Meat Carnival"" level from Psychonauts

-Don't pay, and the events of ""Limbo"" will happen to you."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Easily the best. 


All of those are fucking amazing. 


I've never beaten psychonauts so now I have no excuse. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Better than Humble Indie Bundle 4:  
*Jamestown*, *Super Meat Boy*, *Shank*, *Gratuitous Space Battles*, and *Cave Story+*?

I respectfully disagree!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Lucky you.  The only game I don't have on the list is Limbo.  But it is a game I want, so I am getting the whole bundle.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I have 3 of the games on my XBox already, but I have been wanting to play Annesia for a while and Sword & Sworcery looked neat but lacked a Linux version. Doesn't hurt the money goes to good causes."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Try it if you ever suffer from constipation!
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,[deleted]
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"It's a legitimately fun, exciting, and thought provoking game. It is my favourite game of the last three years and easily in my top 5 of all time.

As much as people say how terrifying it is, it's only as scary as one allows it to be. If you're the type who rarely watched horror movies or plays scary games, you'll probably be impressed with how scary Amnesia can be.

If you're like me though, who's been watching horror movies and playing survival-horror games my whole life, Amnesia really isn't all that much more scary, though the storyline is superior to nearly any other game in the genre. 

If you really find it too scary, I'd recommend playing it during the day, in windowed mode (this is a big one), with the shades open and without headphones. If you're already used to scary games and really want to shit your pants, try it in the middle of the night, door closed, full screen, with high quality, in ear headphones. 

But anyway, I really hope people don't just skip playing Amnesia because they don't like scary things, the fun gameplay, tight controls, immersive music, and *fantastic* storyline are really what makes the game what it is, not just the occasional jump-scares.

tl;dr Play Amnesia. You won't regret it."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Save it for Halloween, then make a friend play it on an entertainment center with surround sound. It can even become a group activity."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Amen. I watched my friend play it, and even then it scared my pants off. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Now you can be like those people that pop up whenever Dead Space is mentioned!

""Dude, Amnesia is so scary, I've never played it! So scary."""
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Same here.  I already watched Day[9]'s playthrough of it, but still don't think I could do it myself.  His playthrough is pretty great, by the way."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Like I do every time a game on Steam I've been meaning to play goes on sale.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yeah I already did that 2 months ago because it doesn't work right with my ATI switchable graphics card. Fuck Steam for not giving me a refund, and fuck Frictional Games for not fixing that."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLeVqSfjWS8) is why you should (or shouldn't) play.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Same. Saw a gameplay video on youtube of someone hiding in a closet from a monster as their heart was pounding, slowly peeking out to see if the monster was gone. My immediate, vocal reaction was NOPE!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Best ART yet. [Look at this.](https://d1wh43egtz3cgo.cloudfront.net/promotion_images/0294/6971/original/HIB5.jpg)

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yep, same here.  I own all but Amnesia, but out goes the wallet.  Then I *have* to buy copies for all my friends, *sigh*..."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,You can't not buy this bundle. It is actually impossible not to buy it.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Paid same way, not received key yet. Like someone else mentioned, I think they are probably just overloaded at this point. I'd give it 1-2 hours for them to get it to you, I'm hoping."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I have messaged them and they have problems with Google payouts.. Humble bundle disabled Google payout for today 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I just purchased mine on google 15 minutes ago, I was confused at first when I did't receive an email. So I hit the back button to the google receipt and there was a link on the page to HB to claim your keys.

I hope this helps."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"NEITHER WAS MINE. AND TECHNICALLY SINCE MY WALLET WAS IN MY POCKET OF THE PANTS I AM CURRENTLY WEARING, IT IS PART OF MY BODY. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Sword & Sworcery is the most unique game I've ever played. The music is FANTASTIC and it's a very immersive experience. It's probably one of my favorite games.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I would say it's worth buying just for the soundtrack.  The thing to remember is that it was originally designed for a touch device so some of the ""magic"" is lost in translation.  However it is still a very unique experience.  The dialogue is kind of quirky and you may not enjoy the sense of humor (it does not take itself very seriously).

If you like point and click games, you'll enjoy it.  If you don't, then you might still enjoy it.  It's not very long...the whole thing can be beaten in about 3 hours if you power through it.  Or it might take you a whole month.  So in the long run I don't think you'd be too disappointed if you played through and didn't like it.  If that's the only game you want you could just throw a couple bucks at it...it's $8 on steam so you'd still be saving money.

edit:  the music used in the bundle video is from S&S, so that should give you some idea of how good it is."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"The best word I would use to describe it is ""atmospheric"".  I am not all that into it myself, but I can definitely see why many people love it to pieces."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Hi. How long I have to wait to bundle keys to arrive? It was my first pay-pal transaction and I'm afraid I could have messed it up.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yeah, I've waited about an hour and even did the key request thing and it still hasn't come in yet.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"THE MILKMAN HERE I COME I SHALL SIT AND WANDER AROUND AIMLESSLY THANKS TO YOUR UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF LINES

yes there is a charchter in psychonauts that has a near infinite amount of lines because it just takes parts of his sentences and regurgatates them as he goes."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Honestly, the OSTs for all of these games is worth the price alone. The Bastion sountrack in particular is amazing."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yep, You can download the games DRM free from the humble bundle site, or activate them on steam. Either way, they'll be yours forever, to download whenever on any computer."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Depends on what you're looking for. This bundle is an AMAZING deal if you're into indie games, which r/gaming seems to be a fan of. I've bought quite a few HIBs before and haven't played many of the games (usually only 1 or 2 per bundle), so I'm considering passing this one, even though this is one of the better ones. 

Look up some gameplay videos and reviews on YouTube and see what you think. If this is your first one and don't have a huge backlog already, you don't have much to lose."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Limbo is a dark 2d puzzle game. Amnesia is a dark (at times downright terrifying) immersive horror puzzle game. I found both to be fantastic and would recommend them.

The others I haven't played but I've heard fantastic things about psychonauts.

It's got to be worth the pickup in comparison what you'd get for 10 quid or so elsewhere/in a shop. 

If you like limbo, see if you can pick up braid the next time it's on sale."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Well they're indie games. Means that they aren't mainstream, they don't represent the average game. Indie developers have more freedom and can shine with original ideas, these games are all wonderful little masterpieces and make much fun, but I doubt they will show you how the gaming world looks. Limbo is special because it's more like art, but combined with an awesome story, Bastion has fun gameplay and a wonderful story and Amnesia is the best horror game out there. You get the 5 secret hint games that everybody should have played. And you can't do anything wrong because you set the price. If you've never played a game before these will probably please you, but I don't know if they are a good way into computer gaming, you will be dissappointed by other games.

**TL:DR Buy them, they're worth every penny you're willing to pay, but they don't introduce you to the typical gaming world**"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Its worth it for Psychonauts alone. The sheer scope of the creativity in that game is astounding. Plus - its funny. Plus - its well designed. Plus - it'll keep surprising you with each level. 

I won't even go into the other games in the bundle that I've played (but they're awesome) but this bundle is worth paying $8 to get Psychonauts alone"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Cool, thanks everyone. I dropped my donation (LOVE that part is charity!) and bought 'em. Next ignorant question - are these games I can download and then play offline?

Yes, it's horror done right, making your own fears work againts yourself. And there is no recent horror game that will get over Amnesia.

Silent Hill 2 has the same thought provoking effect (and I think it's superior than amnesia), but it's an AAA title (and not a recent one D: )

I don't own any of the games on the list either!"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Thanks. I paid what I had left in my Paypal acount (~$4 or so) since I own Bastion anyway. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Ok, thanks. Just contacted them and they said basically what you just said :)"

In all seriousness, I remember when the video store had VHS machines they'd rent out cos they were still really expensive. Man I feel old."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"THAT'S MY WORRY!

The only way I haven't shit myself from playing the game is simply that I don't own it. If I own it, I'll definitely play it and then it's all a poop party in trouser town :("
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,The Bastion soundtrack to me is worth its weight in gold. Bought it a few days ago and have had it on repeat since.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I'm definitely not well off financially. I normally wouldn't do something like that but I personally hold the real Humble Bundles (meaning not Android or one developer only ones) in high regard. There have been a lot of ""bundle"" deals being offered now but for me the Humble Bundles are the original. I also am a member of the EFF and donate to Child's Play every year.

Bastion was gifted to me and all the others except Sword & Sworcery I bought on sale. Even with the extra $25 I might not even have paid the full price combined for all five games. If there were no soundtracks included I likely would of given just enough over the average to get another copy of all the games to gift out later. They were really what did it for me and I hope future Humble Bundles include them.

I did the default for how it's splits the money."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Donating to charity/investing in awesome game developers.  Seriously you can't imagine doing this unless you get a commodity in return?  I'm not rich either but every time I have a bit of disposable income I try and do this sort of thing since I know otherwise I'll just be spending it on booze/clothes/entertainment anyway. 
"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yea, the soundtracks are awesome.  Listening to the Bastion soundtrack now, next up is the S&S EP soundtrack."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Well, they were kind of the first Bundle people, weren't they? At least, I heard of HiB back in the 2nd or 3rd and then a bunch more spawned after that. They set the standard and continue to be the best, in my opinion."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Someone needs to contact the devs of Bastion and ask them for this.

EDIT: I contacted the voice of the Narrator, [Logan Cunningham](https://twitter.com/#!/GlancingOnHuman)

EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: Six-76 provided a link to a $0.99 purchase of a Bastion Ringtone pack.  Sadly, it's mainly the music from the game, and a few soundclips.  There is one with ""Hello Hello"", and another with ""Hey Kid, you there?"" that could work, but nothing as awesome as the quote above would be.  
I purchased the ringtone pack, and if you guys really want this, I'd suggest you do the same.  For now, I'm going to look for another way to contact the team and ask about a few new recordings for this.

EDIT 3, THE LEGEND OF CURLY'S GOLD: OK, sent a message to supergiantgames' official twitter.  They seem to be monitoring it right now, what with the bundle release.  I also used the contact form on their site.  You guys could do the same, maybe give them some ideas for cool ringtones.

EDIT 4, A NEW AGE OF AWESOME: Welp, Greg from SuperGiant games and I had the following conversations.  Copy pastes from my e-mail 'cause I'm lazy like that, so if the formatting sucks, DEAL WITH IT!  I'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR YOU ALL!  AND NO THANKS!  JUST ONCE YOU COULD TELL ME YOU LIKED THE SANDWICH I MADE YOU!!!  JUST ONCE!!!!!!

Original E-mail:  
Subject: Have something you could easily produce that I'd gladly pay you for!

Sorry if that subject sounds like spam, I was raised by wild spambots.  
Anyway, sent your official twitter, and Logan's twitter a message, but due to the popularity of the new Humble Bundle (In no small part due to your awesome presence), we got to talking on Reddit, and thought it would be one of the greatest things ever if there were a few Narrator Ring Tones.  I know you have a ring tone pack, but it's mostly just sound clips and single words.  We were thinking more of a real narrative, ""The kid hears a ringing in his ear, reaches out to connect with the world.""  OK, that's a bad example.  A really good one can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ue3w2/humble_indie_bundle_v_pay_what_you_want_for/c4unlht  
Just so you know, I already bought the ringtone pack, and it's nice.  I don't begrudge that dollar, and like I said, I already bought 2 more copies of your game through the bundle, and previously owned it on Steam, and had gifted it to at least one person (Winter Sale was kind of a crazy time for me.)  That said, I'm sure you guys could come up with a few really nice scripts for basic cell phone interactions, get in contact with Logan again, make a few recordings, a zip, an entry in your shopping page, and I will gladly throw money at the screen until those ringtones are on my phone.

Cheers, hope I hear back from you, and thank you again for an insanely good game.

Greg's first reply:  
Hi sretsisworking's real name, which is totally awesome, thank you for writing...! We're listening and appreciate the interest. The specific example you listed from Reddit here is a good one, as the author of it recognized that it's important to us to make sure anything the Bastion narrator says makes sense in the context of his world. That's why he doesn't talk about cell phones or missed calls and so on. We're pretty protective of the character so we don't want to do things that relegate him to a gimmicky voice, though we agree there's a way to do this right. Please don't take this as a promise of anything (we're still reeling from the response to the Humble Indie Bundle) though I wanted to respond back either way.

By the way, Logan and I will be part of an AMA on Reddit tomorrow morning PT as part of the Bundle launch so you could always bring it up then and see what happens...! Nothing like a little public pressure/shaming to coerce us into action. Thanks for your support,

 Greg

My Reply to Greg's Reply:  
Thanks Greg.  I was trying to keep mine within the world of bastion as well, but I'm not the best spur of the moment writer, I'm glad you understand where we're coming from though.  Totally understand that you're busy as hell thanks to the Bundle.  I will definitely push this on the AMA, to try and spur you two into action, and then maybe Reddit can crowd source a few good lines.  Thank you so much for the response.  Only question I have is if you mind if I post this in the mentioned thread so others who were following can see?  And also so that this can finally be the glorious day that OP delivered.  Anyway, very much looking forward to your AMA, thank you for your response and your time, and thank you and everyone at Super Giant Games for Bastion.  I'll save the rest of my questions for tomorrow, they'll be from either my true reddit account, whose power none of you could even begin to comprehend, or Sretsisworking.

Greg's reply to my reply to greg's original reply to my original e-mail, and oh dear, I seem to have gone cross-eyed:  
Hey sure, you're welcome to post it if you like... no email is sacred! I'm the writer on Bastion so I'll be the first to say I wouldn't be super comfortable with crowd-sourcing Rucks, though who knows? The ideas are always welcome and have a lot of fun writing and recording him. The new trailer for the Humble Indie Bundle is just the latest example of that. Anyway see you on Reddit...!

  Greg

There you go folks.  I've done all I can for now.  Keep requesting this at the AMA, and remember in your hearts, the day  OP delivered.  My time here is now done, I must return to my people."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I had paid about $30 for my humble bundle then decided I wanted to buy a couple more as gifts, you cannot pay .01 for it as Amazon will block the payment saying that it costs humble bundle more to have the transaction than the payment you are providing. In the end I think that I paid about 5.00 for each of the extra codes I wanted to gift."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Exactly my thought. I so very much wish I still had that excuse.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,if its like previous bundles you can not as the code is tied to bundles they MIGHT appear in your steam inventory kind of like those preorder bonus
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I think part of it was I got stuck at some point. All the doors I could find were locked. Plus my wife prohibited me from playing it when she was around. She gets scared very easily. 
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I like the way you think.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Same here. Humble bundles are the most enjoyable when you have none of the games.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Upvote for Muppets reference.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,The worst part about this Bundle is now I'm going to have to try Amnesia.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I've been putting off buying amnesia.. until now. With my luck I'll decide to play it when my hubs is out of town and there's a storm in the area and no one else to clean my mess but me.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I just finished Amnesia last weekend. It took me over the course of a year to finish, but I did it.

The ending kind of sucks, but it sill is an awesome game."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"I played it in one sitting, wearing headphones, at night, home alone, with all the lights out. I think I played 10pm-4am. 

I highly recommend playing in a similar manner. Try to get into the experience, rather than playing to ""beat"" it and you'll get the most out of the game. 

Next time you're home alone and have no commitments the next day (so you can sleep in), play it. It's *fantastic*. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,Still worth the overdraft.....

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"And this, my friends, is an example of why the Humble Bundles are awesome. Once you actually get your key, you can download the .exe and play the game anytime. Anywhere. Well, assuming you have a computer capable of playing them and the electricity needed."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,I got it now! Thanks! Now I'm obliged to finish Amnesia.
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Well, there was a link/key on the page when you bought it, but they automatically send an email to the address you gave them that contains a link/key which you can use for ""the foreseeable future"" in order to download them whenever you wish. The neat thing is, that whenever you go to download the games, you can get them for whichever platform (PC/Mac) you desire, however many times you want. The beauty of DRM-free gaming."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"The email has a link that takes you to a download page.  This link should also be right there after you complete the payment (no need to wait on the email).  From there, you can direct download the games and soundtracks, or you can take the Steam keys and add them to your Steam library and download them from there."
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yeah, once they process your payment and when the servers are back up, they'll send you an email with a personal URL and you can download all your stuff there, as well as get your Steam keys. "
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Yup.  Same here.

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-06-01,"Another suggestion if you haven't invested already, you can buy the bundle for cheap (maybe just put $1 in to get the steam keys) and try the games out, and if you like them go back and increase the price you're paying to whatever you want."

ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"Oh yeah, it's that good.

It's *better.*"
ue3w2,2012-05-31,2012-05-31,"It's an excellent game. The gameplay is fluid and dynamic, but my favorite part at this point is music. The soundtrack just works so well with the atmosphere."

Also I'm hoping for a dlc in wich you play as the narrator during the war over point lamaign.He mentions,if you equip the hammer and the rifle,that he ussed the same weapons during his times in the army.Maybe it could be laid out like a story that he is telling kid while they are sitting by a campfire."

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,OMG this is awesome. I already payed $10 so I basically just got 3 free games! This is why I love Indie Game Bundles...
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Literally the gift that keeps on giving.

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,i don't really pc game but I'm really considering this just for Bastion >.<
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,There is no way I can't buy this now.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,This bundle is on another level.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Wow.  Humble Bundle may be one of the best things to ever happen in gaming.  So many great games.  
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Perfect timing I was just considering buying Bastion on xbla for 15 bucks.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Amazing. I've bought 3 now for friends etc, gonna have to grab a few more now. Really really great gifts for under 10$!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I just added $5 to my Humble bundle because these guys are doing the right thing for the industry. They are being smart with their (lack of) DRM, their open pricing model, and their dedication to donations and civic good. This sort of behavior from indie devs makes me want to give them money. I would rather spend the $12 here than torrent cracked copies. They make it so easy and attractive, that they will continue to make money and see success. EA, Activision, take notes. These guys will be eating your lunch in 10 years."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,This is why I love indie developers. I bought this bundle the day it came out. Saw this post and went back to my email and YES!! new downloads available!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Good Guy Humble Bundle

Didn't make me pay for more games. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,And all available on the Ubuntu Software Center. Who says Linux doesn't have games?

Oh well... guess I'll buy them again."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I didn't know about Humble Indie Bundles when Braid originally came with one. I heard it was really fantastic so I illegally downloaded it and played the first level but got a little side-tracked. Now I can play it legally. 

**This bundle is fantastic.**"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I have already bought the bundle, do I have to buy it agin to get the new games?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Looks like i just scored free games. Not sure i'd have recognized without this post as i'd already downloaded them all. Thanks!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Dammit, I can't read the rest of reddit normally because I'm sorting by new and frantically refreshing in this thread D:"

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Wow this is awesome. So glad I clicked this. I realized I had 3 new games waiting for me since I paid above the average a week ago.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I'm happy that I don't even have to pay more, since I bought it before these were added, to get these games! I just went to my page and grabbed the steam key!

Good job humble bundle!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,15$ well spent.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I usually buy into all the bundles, but this time around I already own those games.  "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,if you had already paid for the first bundle you can get the added games for free. just have them email you your key and click the link

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Super Meat Boy? Bought!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Just bought it! That's a pretty nice selection. I finally have Psychonauts an Amnesia! Woot!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I wish you could get steam gift codes for the games you have already bought from previous bundles. I already have most of these games from previous bundles. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Heaven is a world where a Humble Bundle comes out weekly
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is the first Humble bundle I have had the pleasure to purchase, and I cannot wait until the next one if it is even half as good as this!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Hey, I'm new to games.  I play the Morrowind series for fun on XBox sometimes and I've played portal on steam (just to ""get"" the inside jokes about the orange and blue circles), but that's as far as my gaming knowledge extends.  I just purchased this bundle but have NO idea which game to play.  I've never even heard of any of these games before today.  Any advice on how to proceed would be much appreciated.  "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Already own a copy of Bastion. First to PM me nicely can have it!

EDIT: Handed it out!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Oh Notch, you silly philanthropist"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Seems like a lot of people are new to Humble Bundles and have questions about the newly added titles. If you bought the bundle before the new titles were added, you get them for no extra cost (whether you previously beat the average or not). You can follow the link in your original email or ask them to resend your keys and the new games will be included. Enjoy!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Average Mac payment $2 more than Average Windows...and average Linux is $3 more than that. GO LINUX!

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Hey, I have a question. I paid for the bundle last time(a week ago when they had the first four) and I bought this bundle for the above average price so I could get supermeatboy. Does this mean I get the other four games I bought last time? If so, is there a way I can give someone the Steam Key thingie so they can play it? I'm very new to PC gaming and Steam."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"if you havent bought this yet, give me your address and i'll be on my way to punch you in your genitals"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Ive never done one of these before. I am on linux, but am planning on wiping my computer pretty soon, maybe more than once. If i purchase this will I be able to redownload and install after reloading my os?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"it's a pain in the ass for me as european, to can't buy this cause credit cards aren't standard here."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I've never even heard of the other 2 games that aren't Super Meat Boy, but this is probably the best gaming deal I've ever had.

Edit: I felt bad for paying only $4 off of an old pre-paid credit card, so I increased my donation to $15. It still doesn't feel like enough and I've already beaten Bastion before this bundle. I feel like a good person today."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I am almost relieved that my graphics card doesn't support Amnesia.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Lone Survivor is an absolute gem I wouldn't have played it otherwsie. Good times.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Sorry to be somewhat off-topic, but can anybody confirm if these games can be played using the open source ATI driver? I know I had trouble running Braid in the past but I assume its just because I am running a very old ATI card."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Good lord. Unless you already have these games, there is absolutely NO reason not to get this bundle. Seriously."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"What should I play first?!

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I can't even... this is insane...

I never thought it could get better than what it already was...

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Some random person on sc2 gifted this to me. I was on a losing streak. Thank you.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Quick stupid question that might be answered somewhere below: My current computer (a Mac) can't run these games but I know I'm getting a new computer later this summer. However, I'm not sure whether that will be a Mac or a Windows PC. When you pay, is there a way to download these games later? Or how does it work?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I think I have a bastion key I can give to someone. PM me if you're interested.

Keep up the good work and keep playing it forward!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I'm so hesitant to buy though as I already own some of the games. Can I gift my duplicates to someone else? Not that it isn't amazing still.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Reddit is fantastic! Prior to being on this site I was clueless to Steam, and most PC games in general. A lot of these games I'd always wanted to play via my console, but didn't really have the expendable cash for them.

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Does anyone know whether my latest generation Macbook Air will play Super Meat Boy? Core i5 1.7ghz, 4GB RAM, integrated graphics (384MB)..."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Hooray! I picked it up when the only thing I didn't already have on it was Sword and Sorcery. I was interested in Lone Survivor, so I'm pleasantly surprised by the addition."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,You literally have no reason not to buy this now. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,FUCK! I already got it.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"If you already paid the 'Above-the-Average' amount, you can still get the newly added games."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Wow not only is the game bundle a great deal but the support on the site is really helpful. I couldn't access my download page because i didn't get the email and a lovely gentleman by the name of Adam M from the support sent me a link to it. Thanks again dude :)

Great Support A++"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I already bought this before and I still get the new games too? Dear lord, this is the greatest thing to ever grace gaming."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"notch donated 10,000 dollars?! fucking awesome!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I wish the keys were for individual games. I already have Braid and Super Meat Boy and I would have loved to give them so someone.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,This just keeps getting better. and better. and better.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,This is amazing! Oh you guys.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I see all games have support for Linux, mac and windows but is the buy cross platform or do i have to buy a separate one for Linux and one for mac?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Humbly making the Humble Bundle that much more humble.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"God dammit, I just bought braid as well."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Awesome.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Nice.. I picked this up last week and now I'm getting 3 more games than I originally thought I was getting :)
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I already own most of the games in this bundle and still bought it (for over the average). Every time one of these comes out it's like Christmas.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"you get the new games even if you didnt pay the average(but paid before they were added) the first time, FYI for those cheap-o people out there."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I am quite happy with my 20 dollar purchase.

I mean... damn."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,So since I paid 10$ originally do I get the 3 new games?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I love how the first time I buy a Humble Bundle, 3 more awesome games are added. I might do this more often. I only bought this for Bastion to.

EDIT: Why does it say Humble Indie Bundle **8** Moar Stuff, instead of 5? http://i.imgur.com/FPIWW.png"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Haven't they ever heard the saying ""Don't put all your eggs into one bundle?"""
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,so i have a question; if i pay 8 dollars will i get all the games? and can i activate these on steam?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I was angry when I first seen this as I paid above the average to get bastion and steam keys and low and behold more new games. Nice job humble and reddit for point this out to me.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I don't care how much I hear about this, it is still incredible of them. These games are all amazing and this is a deal that cannot be missed by any means."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Humble bundles are so awesome.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I don't even have steam and I think I'm going to buy the bundle. This is just too awesome of a deal to pass up.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Well, this sure made MY day."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is the first humble-bundle games I buy.  I probably won't even play it, since I spend enough time at the computer at work, so by the time I get home, if I game, its on console.

Either way! Thanks for the heads up!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"when does this come out?
"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Dammit, I JUST bought Super Meat Boy!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I couldn't resist buying it, I love this stuff."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I am literaly waving money and yelling 'TAKE MY MONEY!'

There.... got it. paid premium but it's worth it. Own 2 of theese and they are classics. the rest are probably superb games too. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I paid even though I have most of the games on consoles, I just thought supporting these artists were a good idea.
Now I get even more value, incredible!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,They've convinced me to buy it. Mostly for SMB. Hope the PC controls don't drive me crazy after being used to playing on xbox though. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is such an amazing deal. I just wish I could have gotten into PC gaming later, I've bought almost all of these games full price in the past 3 months. -_-"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Does anyone have a spare key for bastion? She just wants bastion... It's not me, I swear. I bought the bundle already."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"What's lone survivor like? I hate to sound stingy, but it's the only game I'm interested in/don't have and i only have £20 in my bank account."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Ok I bought it, I have no idea what the games are...  I also have HB3 which I've never played anything from.

Are any of these alright for playing on a low spec laptop (lenovo s205)."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,why did I find this out here instead of them emailing me?  Bastion has been amazing!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,PLEASE tell me how can i use Paysafecard to get these . can i interchange psc for google checkout paypal or something? i wanna support he developers + its the best deal for the best games around :)
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is an awesome sight to see, so much money for charity, so many cool games for great prices. Humble bundle is one of the best things to happen to my steam library."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Can anyone tell me if these games are compatible with a 360 controller?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"My god, you even get the steam keys."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Bought a $20 Amazon gift card to buy Humble Bundle and redeemed it. To my surprise, you can't buy the Humble Bundle using the money in your Amazon account, even if you click the amazonpayments button. It has to be a credit card. So angry -_-"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Wow...I wasn't going to buy it, now I have no choice."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Lone Survivor is amazing. I already bought it when it came out, but it's worth it. This whole bundle is so sexy."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Awesome! What can I do if I bought this a few days ago though?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I can't believe I ever missed out on Minecraft. Please release this again please?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,It's so damn funny I'm going to loose this eight games just because I can't manage my paypal account and I can't pay with VISA... So funny I want to cry.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"What does that mean for those of us who already bought it?

**Edit:** Disregard, I suck cocks."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I LOVE that if you paid above average you get these be default.

Even if I did already have them from previous bundles."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,fuuu- v.v I just bought this as a gift to a good friend and they add this a few hours later... fml!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I already own half of these games and this bundle is still ridiculously amazing. For anyone who doesn't own these, holy leaping jackpot batman."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"If I already got the bundle last week, can I get these too?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"hmm, I activated the key on steam and my games aren't downloading. Can anyone offer help? What do I do to get my extra games downloading?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Well so much for me getting any work done when I get home...
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I have an unused Bastion key if anyone wants it.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I wish i didn't already buy most of these games for xbox... :(
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I'm giving away the Amnesia, LIMBO, Sword and sorcery and Psychonauts code.  If anyone wants it, PM me and it's yours.  First come first serve so do it quick.

Edit: The codes are gone, sorry!  
"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Why do so many top posts always have like a 40% downvote ratio? i've read reddiquette and understand people have their opinions, but I dont get why so much good content gets a mass of downvotes, especially something like this?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Wait I'm confused. I already purchased the bundle before the new games were added. Can I download the the 3 new additions for free or do I have to purchase again?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,How do I handle this amount of awesome?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Glad i paid double the average. At this rate I will have ALL THE GAMES!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is my first humble bundle. I donated some money and got all the games. Now, they've gone and added more games and I get those for no extra money?! This is awesome! Though now I feel like I should give more money.....maybe I'll gift a bundle.

One question, is it common for them to add more games to the bundles like this?

Another question, how often do they do bundles?

Edit: I accidentally  a word"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,FFFFUUUUUUCCCCCKKKK I NEED THE NEW ADDONS!!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,So anyone knows how much money was given to charity and devs? We have the total amount but not the shares.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Just bought the last bundle with these game but the last 3 of them... I hate my life
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Braid is so good, one of the most satisfying and fulfilling games I've ever played.  Can't recommend it enough."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Mhm, is there a way I can get the soundtrack of Super Meat Boy? 
As far as I know it's not in the Bundle but can is it saved somewhere in the program files?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Hmm, can this be gifted? "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I already owned the first five, and I own these three too. I don't care... it's so good and I already have every other Humble Bundle so I need to buy this out of principle."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"does anyone know if gift codes expire if they arent redeemed within 7 days?

i bought it for a friend but he doesnt have internet"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I'm so impressed with this project. I had every game except Super Meat Boy and I still got this Bundle. I got a game to torture myself with for charity!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Considering if you already bought this you get the others as well this is very cool
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I have searched but cannot find an answer to this question:  Can I play these games on my PS3?  I want to buy them, but I don't want to play them through my PC.  I will be paying at least $8 to get all the games and the Steam code (but I have never tried using Steam on PS3).  Sorry if this questions has already been asked and answered.  Thank you."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"They should've added Jamestown or Cortex Command, they were really good.
I actually missed out on HB4 so I assumed they would give that bundle with the next like they've done in the past. Not complaining though, these are amazing games."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Humble Bundle........ the greatest gift to mankind since the graphics card.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"If I already bought the bundle, before they added more games, do I get the four new ones? I paid $15. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Is there any way to see a chart of how much goes to charity, developers and humble bundle? I'd like to see the ratio."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is absolutely the best bundle I already own all the main games on.

It's like they're mocking my last three years of indie purchases by offering them to me for like 1/20th what I originally paid. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"That settles it. I just bought my first Humble Bundle. Lots of games there I've wanted to try, and for a good price and a good cause I can't resist!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,[deleted]
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Just yesterday I bought Braid...
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I have a question! it says ""pay more than the average of 7-8 bucks to unlock these four games."" does that mean that if i pay like 9 bucks, I get those 4 games for a total of 8 games? or does it just unlock them for a second purchase."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,So...there's like no excuse not to get this now.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Now I have to buy it.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,What if we already bought it last week??
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Bought mine. I already have Braid, LIMBO, and Super Meat Boy on Xbox Arcade, but screw it, this is too cool to pass up."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Yeah no I could not resist buying this
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Just bought it.  Is there anything more maddening than Super Meat Boy? 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This jus a dream rite?
Waking up in 3 , 2 , 1 ..."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,On account of owning or having completed (or both) the new titles added I doubt I'll be needing my key. Anyone want it?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Everyone who bought Humble Bundle 5 before these games were added might have received these. I bought a bunch and gave them away here on Reddit and myself and everyone I gave a bundle away to got these games.

Thank you Humble Bundle!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Everyone else seems to know whats going on and somehow I just can't find the answer I'm looking for...
In the Humble Bundle IV I donated $25 dollars... well above the average. Does this mean in order to get the new games I have to once again purchase the games I already got AND the new ones? Or is there some magic trick I am unaware of? "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I just paid 8 cents over the average, for 2 games.
I have got bastion for 4 cents.
I'm not sure if I'm a scumbag or not:S"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"i have a mac and i never game, but for the past few months ive been debating whether or not to build a PC.

well i contributed $50.00 all towards charity, and im not even sure if i can play half of these games. i dont care. maybe someday i can when i have a PC."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"What if I already bought the bundle at 8.00 (above average)... can I still get the other three games? If so, how.."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This will get buried but if anyone wants SMB and Braid for free send me the game ""Lone Survivor"" and I wll send you a code for all three games."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,But I just bought it yesterday does that mean I can't get super meat boy? Or are they gonna give me those games too :(
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I bought this bundle already and paid more then average (at least at the time) but now im in a location where I can't download the new games for a while (bw limitations).  How long do i have to download these before my personal link  goes down?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Awesome, bought!

Especially looking forward to Lone Survivor. Had a little trouble remembering the in-game shortcut keys, so I [concatenated some screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/goyCu.png). Handy on my second monitor!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,wow lol thx for the deal!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07," I love the Humble Bundle but I hate that I already buy indie games at normal cost, and these damned nice people bundle them for the cheap and all I get is feeling ripped off, like I should wait until the times of year they offer the bundle. Obviously it's all for a good cause and there are minimums, but usually that minimum smokes the cost of one of the games alone."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,i've already donated - can i play these on xbox 360 arcade somehow?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Just got the bundle, tried to play Super Meat Boy & got this error....

"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Holy ship. Just holy ship. There's now no reason any pc game shouldn't buy this, it's literally the best bundle of games on the internet."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,annnnnnd purchased.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I another somewhat related topic, should I buy the King Arthur Collection that's on steam right now? I'm curious about that game."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Wait, i already bought the bundle beforehand, so do i get these games or do i have to rebuy?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,WHY DID I HAVE TO ALREADY BUY IT
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Just bought it, mainly for Super Meat Boy, LIMBO and Amnesia since those are the only games there I know are really good but I will definitely play the others!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,holy crap! best surprise ever :)
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Thanks for the heads up!!I donated a legit amount this time. Lone Survivor alone is $10 on Steam. Have an extra LIMBO, Amnesia, Sword & Sworcery, and Psychonauts Steam Key if anyone wants to trade."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I'd think this is worth a hefty sum. I'd donate if I could. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"The bundles just keep getting better, take that all you people who didn't pay the average...even though I already had LIMBO, and Super meat boy.  But Braid is nice!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,If only they added the binding of isaac instead of SMB/Braid. I already have them :(
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Finally people can get the chance to play Psychonauts. I remember my friend and I accidentally stumbling upon this game before it came out and watching the days count down on their website. It holds a very deep place in my heart
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I have a dell inspiron 1525, would downloading this bundle be worth my time?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Do you still get the new ones if you already bought the bundle?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I was a bit concerned I wouldn't get them because I already bought them, checked and there was a key already waiting for me. :) Love these guys. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,How does this work if you've already bought the bundle?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I like cowboys.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Why can't I use an amazon gift card as a payment type... I am frustrate. I'll have to actually use a credit card.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,YES! I've been wanting to play Super Meat Boy for a long time now!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I never played PC games before this. I bought the humble bundle and have been sort of playing psychonauts, and it is now my goal to finish these games by the end of the month, jeebus."

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I'm not one for buying games because I'm on Mac, but this was just too good to turn down. £6 (because I'm cheap) for some AMAZING games. 

THANK YOU HUMBLE BUNDLE."

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"so should I wait a little longer to get this when even more games are added? lol

also, does this allow me to get steam achievements?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Bastion is still stand alone, which is perfect, because I already own it. Probably gonna give it away to someone."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,honestly the best $8 I ever spent. By far.

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"That's it, I'm getting this."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Bought Meat Boy for Xbox and PC stand alone, bought it in the previous bundle, and I shall be buying it again shortly :\

Definitely a first world problem."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Oh my sweet jebus people, buy this bundle before it's gone and you will not regret it.

Best HIB ever. Period. Until HIB6 which will hopefully be even awesomer!"

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,it is so awesome that they are doing this on linux as well
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,thats it im getting this!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Do I need something special for my laptop to play amnesia? I want to play it but I don't have any special gaming equipment.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Dear God, could this get any better?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I had to contribute some more to get the other games because what I paid at first wasn't higher than the average is now. But you know what? I ain't even mad. I'll most likely pay some more when I get more money just because I love these guys and what they do. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I'd pay more than that just for the Bastion soundtrack - seriously that shit is amazing, check it out if you haven't!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"awesome, although this is only possible since it costs them nothing to donate and distribute games"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Say I already buy this and get they steam codes, but already have LIMBO, can I separately gift LIMBO away? "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Is anyone else having trouble running one of these games? All of them started fine for me except Amnesia.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,This is amazing. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Do you still need to pay more than the average to get bastion? The wording of the website has confused me.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Not sure I can resist any more.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Thank you for posting this... i almost forgot about it... and now there are even more games!!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"If anyone wants to gift me lone survivor ill give you bastion and lone survivor, braid, super meat boy."

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This bundle is full of so many good games that I already own most of them for my xbox. Still bought it.
"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I have purchased two bundles! I felt guilty for not paying enough.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,So do I pay $15 and get to pick the 4 games I want or is it random? Do they provide Steam keys? How dies this work exactly?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I'm about to explode from excitement! 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,What if I have already donated to this for 2 people before the other games were added on?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I've been wanting to play Amnesia for quite some time, and I really think I'll enjoy Lone Survivor. Happy to donate to this one."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"How well will Amnesia play on my late 2011 15"" 4gb RAM macbook pro? Am i better running it in bootcamp?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I'm holding off until next month's inevitable indie bundle.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I bought this on Steam.  Where do I go to download these game they added?  Also, how might I access downloads for the soundtracks later?

Edit:  Nevermind, I figured it out.  Use the Lost Key button at the top of their website and enter your email address.  Follow the link in the email and click the link in the page to show Steam Keys.  Click the button to renew the newest key for the games that were just added."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Saw it, bought it, love it."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,The only thing that bothers me about Humble Bundles is...I already have all of these games and I still want to purchase this one to support developers.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I already own all of these games on either my PC or 360, but charity is always nice. Plus, choosing who my money goes to is a nice perk. $10."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I already own 62.5% of the games on the list.  I think I'll have to pass, this time."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I just have to say thanks to the people at humble bundle. I only wanted 2 game and had little cash so i only donated 3$ the second day of the bundle. I still got the new games that were added to the bundle. Even though i donated less then the average. These people are amazing. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Note for Linux users: [Super Meat Boy has finally been updated](http://support.humblebundle.com/customer/portal/articles/579609-super-meat-boy-6-7-12-changelog), and most bugs are fixed but some issues still remain. The headcrab works and the final boss no longer segfaults, but you still can't access Super Meat World or the leaderboards."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,The best part is if you bought it early you can go back to that url they mail you to get the new add on games.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I've never done a humble bundle...

I have almost no room on my HDD and the only games I have on there I'm currently playing. I can buy this now and install the games, say, 5-6 months from now, right?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I tried super meat boy on linux and it is horrible, do any of these guns run anywhere near decent?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I already have SMB, I installed the other 2... is there some way to gift it?

I gave a friend Bastion since I have that too. :3"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"My bro got me these games today, he called from another city and told me to check facebook quick :D Love ya Krunos"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"already own braid and meatboy, is lone survivor worth it or just give it away?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"At first I was like: oh no! I should've waited until now to get them! Now I'll have to pay more! (You have to understand that my knee jerk reaction was disappointment as even though I'd only have to spend eight bucks to get them, my brain instinctively just said said ""spending more money is bad! Avoid spending more money!"")

But then I clicked on my old download link...and I was pleasantly surprised. :D"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,I've had more fun playing these than any AAA I've played this year!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I know, I know, Macs suck for gaming or whatever, but I feel really compelled to support this. Does anyone know if most of these games will work on a regular ol' 2011 Macbook Pro by any chance?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"This is the first one of these bundles I've seen that is actually worth it. Usually it's a few sub par games packed with one decent quality one. Looks like they picked only decent or above titles for this bundle. Too bad I've already played all but two of them. Still if anyone hasn't played Bastion it's good for an indie game, recommend it just for that game.

"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"My brother told me, after I had purchased the original bundle, that they keep adding games the later it gets.  I was kind of bummed that I would have to miss out on all of those, but I would totally pay again.  I checked the Humble Bundle page and noticed they did add games, and I kind of flipped at the awesomeness.  Then I checked my own bundle page and passed out for a few minutes while they all downloaded."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"I've been curious to try Super Meat Boy for ages now, so this was a very, very happy surprise to wake up to! I hadn't tried any of these games prior to buying the bundle, and it's been fun.

My personal favourite so far is Bastion. Great game with beautiful visuals and an incredible soundtrack. I wish Diablo had a similar control scheme as Bastion.  
"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Shut up and give them your money!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"now that i have these games i would love to go play them, but after spending 9 hours on Psychonauts and having my saved game deleted, I'm a little hesitant :/"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"Hm.. I have all these games except Braid, Super Meat Boy and Survivor. oh why was I so hesitant on buying the bundle"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"If I just bought Humble Indie Bundle V this morning, before they added on these additional three games, what happens to me? Do I buy it a second time?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,"i already have some of these games, what do i do when i redeem the code from steam(since it unlocks multiple games) and i have xtras? i dont see the xtra ones any where"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-07,Shut up and take my money.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"To bad I didn't have enough to get Bastion, but all of the other games are really awesome!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Alright, question. I expect to get fucked verbally, but I'm curious to know. What is this whole indie bundle thing? I've literally seen it all over reddit for a while now. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Checked my email for the download page, and found my email from the voxatron bundle. Checked it out, and noticed it, too, had grown since i initially bought it! Suddenly i have so many games! Both these addons and the ones from the voxatron debut bundle!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Is Bastion any good. I am trying to decide if I should get it?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Damnit! I own all of these except for Lone survivor... and I want it so damn much.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"What are your opinions on Braid, Super Meat Boy and Lone Survivor? I may increase my order amount to get these games. (I bought this after it got announced)"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Psychonauts? That isn't really an indie game... I mean it was published as a retail release and everything.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Just got mine!!!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Once you use your key for steam, can you share it with your friends so they can use it as well?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,An amazing thing for them to do. Will keep me loyal to them through the next Bundles and beyond. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Eight fantastic Indie titles in one day...have I died and gone to heaven?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"why does this have 7,747 down votes? do people not like the idea of cheap stuff or is it the charity part that bothers them?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I keep on wondering if the next bundle is going to be as good.... and then it always is and then some.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,[deleted]
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Is it weird that I have a few of these games for 360 already (and I beat them, bastion multiple times), but I still want to buy them again, just because?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I have a PC and a pretty crappy linux laptop that can run Braid out of the pack. Can I install the rest of the games on the PC and then Braid on the laptop or they have to be installed in the same machine? Thanks in advance.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,FINE I bought the bundle lol
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Damn if it was active one more day then I would be paid, always next time
"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"This just had to come out when I was broke...  Hmmm, what can I sell."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"THEY SENT ME THE ADDED GAMES!  I DIDN'T EVEN ASK THEY JUST SENT THEM TO ME!  Humble Bundle kicks so much ass, I wish I knew about this earlier."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I deleted my key page and then they add these games. Anyone know if it's possible to get that back? Requesting my keys again doesn't seem to bring me to the original page where I was able to download my games.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I just pulled this down last night, as well as buying Super Meat Boy off Steam normally. Oh well, I still think it's a great deal...my only wish would've been to add the new games' soundtracks as well."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,might as well add rest of the indie games. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"*sigh*

Where's my wallet... again..."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,This is amazing. More amazing than watching the Hulk beat the crap out of Loki. 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Why hasn't anyone really mentioned Lone Survivor? It's fucking good.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I've only bought bundles 2, 4 and 5, but they threw in 1, 3 and the Introversion Bundle all in there for free!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"And you can get the new ones after you already payed? 
My summer is going to be more awesome then ever. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,So a lot of words are a part of something regarding a lot more words. Got it!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,The best game on there is now OFFICIALLY SUPER MEAT BOY. I have had it for more than a year now and it is the most amazing platformer I have ever played. A+ Get it now!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I am soooo happy I decided to wait before buying this. Thank you <3
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Fuck, i cant transfer any money from my debitcard to paypal. Is there any humble redditor that could transfer 1 dollar to my paypal account?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I bought the first set of games before they added on the last three. Would I have to pay again to get access to the newly added content?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I donated :) Can't wait to play these awesome games!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Dammit, why did I buy all these games separately already?!!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"The thing is, with most humble bundles, you can download the games for free somewhere else online. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Question -- Im probably gonna sound like a tard...but...  i bought this the other day, and now there are new games...but how do you get back to your download page? "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,All of my love to these guys.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,lol What the hell are they going to put in future bundles?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I just bought it. Looks great.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I bought Lone Survivor like a few months or so ago and... I haven't played it for weeks now...

SPOILER WARNING: [No jazz at all...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=P5rQqKCKj-s#t=1420s)"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I love the Humble Indie Bundle so much, but the only problem is that I already had Super Meat Boy from a previous Humble Indie Bundle, but it doesn't even take it to your Steam inventory, I wanted to give it to a friend, that's really annoying. Great bundle anyway."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Don't get me wrong this is awesome, but it's also a massive mistake by the guys running the Humble Bundle. 
They should have raised the amount required to be donated to double the average in order to get these new games. It'd still been a value and their charities would get even more then. :/

Also, what are they gonna put in future Humble Bundles as an incentive now?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I checked my old link to the last two bundles that came and holy crap there was like 10 add ons for each. If you still have your links to the old bundles go check them!!!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I feel really cheap, and that makes me feel bad :/ I had $1.48 left in my PayPal account after selling a PlayStation 3 I had purchased with money I had earned from Christmas/Birthday/LawnCare/Babysitting ... I had to use that money to pay an outstanding debt someone in my family had accrued. 

I gave it all to Charity though, I really hope $1.48 isn't an insult to them... these games look absolutely amazing. I want to pay more and if I can earn some more money I will most certainly donate more."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I love Braid so far. Much more deep than I thought. I even bought two bundles, one for me and one for my brother. "
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Does anyone else feel a tiny bit guilty for paying less than 10 bucks for this bundle?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Awesome. Just bought it a few days ago. Loving Bastion!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Sadly, as amazing as this bundle is, I already own all of these titles individually!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I just bought it and Bastion itself is worth the 20 I donated. Good cause, great games!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"holy shit super meat boy was added, just amazing"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I already own. . . . all these games. . . .

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"This is my first time hearing about Bastion. I'm floored with how beautiful the game is! What a great concept.

First time I've done the HIB, so worth it."
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I already own a few of these games and I'm not so smart, how do I give away steam keys for other people to use? I don't normally use steam."

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I honestly don't see how anyone could downvote this! $155 worth of games for just over $8 at the moment? What isn't there to like?
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,this is probably the greatest deal of all time. But this. Now.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,As a guy who onws none of those games; FUCK YEAH !
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Im guessing I cant buy this with a prepaid credit card.
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"I don't know about you guys, but Lone Survivor is almost as scary as Amnesia for me..."

jesus christ thats awesome....some of the best games i ever played

especially braid"

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,My computer can't run Amnesia sadly :( Wish I could pick 5 out of a lot of 10 or something
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"So we're all just waiting for the very end of the sale right?

Yep.

(If I buy it now and they add more later, would I get the extras?)

edit: apparently so!"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I received some free points for XBL and just bought Bastion. I played it for the first time tonight. I love stumbling on games like that!
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Reddit is a shithole.  Move to a better social media platform.  Also, did you know you can use ereddicator to edit/delete all your old commments?"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Great, I deleted my download page after getting the keys and putting it steam last week, now they've added more games that I can't get since my download page is gone. fml"
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,This was my first PC gaming purchase cause OMG it's awesome other than my friend bought Recettear at the same time. Lone Survivor was awesome for a game I've never heard of til today. I think the only thing I want really bad PC wise right now is Killing Floor and Day Z/Arma II. Just poor. (Steam summer sale?) Thanks Dev guys and humblebundle!!

uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,I didn't buy the bundle.  But I did watch the bundle counter cycle through about 50 people...
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,Yey I didn't have to pay extra to get them 
uq0lu,2012-06-07,2012-06-08,"Just bought for $10. I would have paid more, but it's all I could afford right now."

It costs them nearly nothing for you to download the games. That's the wonder of digital distribution (and why ""piracy"" is not theft). You're just getting a copy of the game. You're not removing anything from them. They're not losing inventory. So if a couple million people pay a dollar they're getting more than if much fewer people paid $15."

What’s interesting about the Bronies is they came to it with another perspective – we’re kind of misunderstood and we want the world to understand how great we are. So yeah, it’s a fun thing. **One of my favourite gifs on Reddit was when people were discussing the rivalry, and someone posted a link to Smithers and Burns just throwing money at each other. “Money fight!”** And of course, Notch is believed to be a fairly wealthy person, and the Bronies are a community of people.

Z is equal to Y as Y purchases Z

They'd have to set some kind of a cap, of course, but it would be a great way to push it up near the beginning. 

They'd still have the same main deal where better than average gets you some other bonus, though. "

The money almost always ends up in some companys pockets in one way or the other, so I don't really see that as a relevant complaint for child's play

That and, just because there are bigger problems doesn't mean it's not okay to give some lesser problems a little attention. You know, 3 million is a little bit of water vapor in the bucket to say, cancer research, yet that same 3 million  can at least make childrens life in a hospital for a long stay more bearable.

If it's a simple ""I make game, you distribute"" kind of thing then they are still ""independent"", even though they have a publisher.

This is the case for quite a few indie titles with boxed versions (World Of Goo comes to mind), where the devs simply leveraged the publishers existing infrastructure.


The primary sign is when the publisher came on board.

Was the design already finished then (or at least far along)? Did they change anything because of the publisher (intro logos don't count)? 

I'm not sure how it was with Bastion, though."

The name of the piece is likely in reference to the song Run boy run by woodkid. The music video for this song shares a lot of it’s visual style with both Limbo and this drawing. Also highly recommended.

Neat drawing my dude. Keep it up."

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,I always loved this game! 
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"This could easily pass for a “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustration.

I’ve played the game myself... but somehow, you have given me chills in a whole different way with this rendition."
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"Not sure if the kids name is limbo.

I think what he/we experience in the game IS Limbo

Sorry for being Smart ass"

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Limbo and Inside are two of the most depressing games I’ve ever played. The vibe that they give off is something truly unique. 
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,That's awesome man. Nailed the look and feel of it. Beautiful.
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Awesome. And what a great game!

good job and well done..

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Very cool game and you caught its essence perfectly.  Great job.
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"I love when people call the main character of a game the title of the game. Like not being rude, I actually love it and laugh really hard every time. Like if someone says ""oh look, there goes Halo, off to fight the covenant again. What a hero""

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"I think this is the kind of game that would greatly benefit from the ""white colour on black paper"" treatment.  
Perhaps if you want to do another Limbo drawing of a darker area, could be a cool way of doing things."
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,And limbo was his name-o
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,This game was really scary in parts. But really good (I did cheat of a couple of the puzzley bits). Just wish it had an actual explanation as to what went on. 
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-12-30,Awesome Atmosphere...

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Wait is the kid actually named limbo
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,This is a screenshot... right?
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Is this really a charcoal drawing? Looks like you just put a screenshot in photoshop
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Yo this is just a screenshot
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"If they were to ever do an enhanced remake, I'd love to see charcoal mode as an option."

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Limbo is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills spiders and doesn’t afraid of anything. 
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,It is. Just like that Zelda dude...

9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Probably a reference to Run Lola Run.(1998 movie)
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"In Limbo, you play AS Limbo."
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,Thank you.
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"I can't help but feel like people who do artsy shit are always ignorant of the actual game. Anecdotal. I just see it happen on reddit a lot. 




Nonetheless, cool drawing. "
9chbmz,2018-09-03,2018-09-03,"I totally don't! Just saw my little brother playing it, its beauty haunted me and I thought I should totally draw it on paper."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Iron Giant one is the best. Someone down below linked an Adventure time one, thats awesome also. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"If Limbo had mods... oh god, the time sink it could be."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,They should add Slenderman into this
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,You guys may like /r/Ghibli. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This reminds me that I need to finish playing limbo. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,the last one i can just picture the iron giant saying: DEANNNNNnnn
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This reminds me that I need to finish playing limbo.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This made me ridiculously happy.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I saw number 5 and freaked everyone around me out yelling "" I WANT THIS TO BE REAL!"""
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,What game is this?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Massive props to whomever made these! <3 One of my favourite puzzlegames combined with some of my favourite anime. Just glorious! 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Studio Ghibli is amazing.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Love Spirited Away!!!!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"What a stunning, utterly infuriating game."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,+1 for anything Iron Giant!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,They really need to make a sequel
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I thought the addition of The Iron Giant was fucking awesome. I loved that movie. <3
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,When is LIMBO 2 coming out ? :(
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Tim Burton crossover: Limbo.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,These would be even better at wallpaper size
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,iron giant was the best
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,So much childhood nostalgia 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Spirited Away is what got me into anime. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,As if this game wasn't creepy enough.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Being (shamefully) a Ghibli illiterate, I genuinely thought #1 was Majoras Mask. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,The Iron Giant is amazing...
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Jack Skellington looks like Slenderman
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"This is Limbo, so...

Where's the part where they rip off the kid's arms and impale him through the chest? I mean, am I the only one here who played Limbo and didn't just appreciate its art-style?"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Oh God, I understood the Japanese references.

And I liked them."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,IT'S JAAACK!!!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I like to imagine that #2 is Alien Hominid
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This fits really well with the Totoro is the death god theory.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This is beautiful. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"You should post this over on /r/ghibli, they'd love it."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,fucking lost it at jack skeleton
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I don't suppose this is out for iPad is it?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Wow, can't believe I recognized all of those. This is awesome"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,As someone who just bought this and is playing it through for the first time as we speak (I'm on a Reddit Break); I approve highly of this relevance.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Would you happen to have the Nightmare Before Christmas and the Iron Giant ones in 1920x1080?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,anyone have wallpaper sized #5?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Limbo and Nightmare before Christmas made me go full fanboy for a second.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,The fact the first three are Miyazaki makes me love this.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Anyone able to make this into a desktop background?  The current one's are a bit blurry, but these are awesome!"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Awesome find!
Im going to bug the artists for these prints :)"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I'd die to have these in 1080p !!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,HOLY SHIT THE IRON FUCKING GIANT REFERENCE
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I must have  #5 as a 1920x1080 wallpaper. Can anyone do this for me?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I used to LOVE spirited away as a kid.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Wow... The Iron Giant pic gave me goosebumps. That is such a nice pic.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Is this game worth it? Should I buy it?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,You really made me want to rewatch all the Ghibli movies...
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Kaonashi is the best

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This. Is. Fantastic.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Shit.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Iron Giant. Best animated movie.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"Do any make the game better, or will it still be one people convince themselves has to be good because it's ""deep""."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,Iron Giant did it for me
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"""Uh....Uhhh"""
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,Holy shit this would be awesome. The style would be doubly beautiful and creepy.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,wallpaper?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,The Iron Giant is fucking amazing.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"I still remember seeing Spirited Away for the first time on cartoon network when they had a anime special. I loved all the movies from that special and began my love for Japanese anime, but spirited away was my favorite and i watched it every time it was on."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,I liked the Iron Giant one. The rest were a bit out of proportion in respect to the characters.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,No Face scared the fuck out of me as a kid.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,My favorite is the first one. That movie was my childhood
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,i like the top one spirited away is in my opinio one of the best movies ever
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Is that Vin Diesel?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Wow. This adds an entry to my list of things that need to be turned into awesome video games (started today):

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This might be one of my favorite things I've seen on reddit.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Ha, Totoro is so cute man"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Looks good. 

Too bad Limbo itself sucks so bad after the spider is dead. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I was expecting stretch Lamborghinis
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I've never seen #3 so I don't know but if you haven't seen 1 and 2 you should, especially 2. They are EXCELLENT anime movies. Even people who don't like anime have told me that they enjoyed them."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Couldn't tell if I was having a hard time recognizing the first three or if I'd just never seen them.

Thanks for helping me figure out it was the latter."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I only got the  last two references :(
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Number 3 is the Studio Ghibli film I've been trying to remember the name of for ages! I've never seen it, but I've seen most of their other stuff, can't wait. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"Also, I think Howl's Moving Castle is in the background of the Spirited Away one. Not completely sure, though, haven't seen the movies in awhile. "

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"The first three are all anime movies by Studio Ghibli, and they are all absolutely fantastic. In order they are Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro. I highly recommend the first two, especially Princess Mononoke, and while I didn't like it quite as much My Neighbor Totoro is still very charming."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I use the Portal crossover as my desktop background. I really should buy a print from the artist at some point since they used my feedback for it.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"You're right, except that song is in the beginning!"

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Ugh... Totoro was a childhood staple. That is, until I read the alternate story interpretations. Here's one: http://my.opera.com/sukekomashi-gaijin/blog/tonari-no-totoro

The studio has denied these explanations at every turn, but still.. cannot un-read! "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I'd just love a remastered version of Shadow of the Colossus. Such a beautiful game. Agro, how I miss you T_T"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Hell, if they got away with Iron Giant, I think you're in the clear."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I like. Very inkeeping with the style. Worth pursuing I think.
"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Honestly, I think the Colossus not being pure black & white like the rest of the foreground really clashes. All it needs is a simple recoloring and it would be fantastic."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,But they're so nice and friendly.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,my bf makes fun of me because i'm absolutely terrified of spiders and seeing a giant spider silhouette freaks me the fuck out every time. especially when you walk up to it and it sticks its one leg out... ugh. no. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I got as far as the spider and gave up.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"The developer calls it ""Trial by death."" Don't feel bad... "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Any link to where these could be bought?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,GET. THIS. GAME. By far one of the best games I've ever played.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Since it's hella cheap on steam, I guess...

It's only about 2 hours from start to end, the story is really bland, and the game play is trial and error and error and error... I wasn't really a fan."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Yes. Wait for a sale, it goes down often. But yes. Yes yes yes."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"1. spirited away, 2. princess mononoke"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,While there may be the slight overlap in terminology the two don't really fit well.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,1 hour left on steam sale at $2.49. [GO GO GO.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/) 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Wauit for a sale, it's been 75% off a couple of times in the last couple of months. do it and never look back
"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Eh...

I managed to beat it 100% in under 2 hours, it's a pretty short game. I guess since it's on sale, that's a little better, but I've played flash games with more substance than Limbo."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,[From another comment.](http://ichigopaul23.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=limbo)
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,iron giant is a really depressing movie.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I liked limbo until I got to the water puzzles, from that point on it stoppd being inpired and turned merely good."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,fat-asstic?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Definitely recommend on. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Check out the PC demo, if you can run it smoothly then go for it.
I say this cause Limbo's performance is pretty bad even though it's 2D, and you could have a nasty surprise.

Also, both keyboard and gamepad are fine."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Played it on PC with 360 Pad plugged in. Worked great.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Better on PS3
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Yes it's a great quick little game. Atmospheric sidescroller with physics puzzles.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I played it together with a girl in front of an Xbox, taking turns when someone dies (and you can die quickly),  till the sun got down and all went dark and devoid of colour. Very well made and stylistic interesting game. There is a reason it is well known/remembered and pops up regularly in gaming discussions."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I say not really, unless you have $5 to throw away.

The game is only about 2 hours from start to finish. You'd be better off playing some flash games on Newgrounds."

* [The Iron Giant](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/)"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,no.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"No, it's an artist rendition."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Whoosh
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I have to say that it did, before the spider was an inspired game, after it it was mrely a good game. I still loved it"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Studio Ghibli is well known for their excellent animated films. I'd recommend almost all of them
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Number 3 is awesome also.  Cat Bus!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"My favorite by the same studio is 'Howl's Moving Castle' by far, highly recommend."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"No love for Porco Rosso, anyone?"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,My Neighbor Totoro is actually my favourite one. You must see it.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I found that Mononoke had a style to it that was beautiful and rich with culture, but I think that it didn't quite dare-to-dream quite so much as Spirited Away did. It didn't quite contain the liberty that Spirited Away did, but it came exceptionally close. Still one of my favorite movies, however.

I feel that Spirited Away should never be made in a new style, yet if I were told that Princess Mononoke was to be redone differently, I would be quite interested and not at all upset to see the result."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Agreed. Princess Mononoke is a must see. My Japanese teacher showed us the film when I was in high school, and I'm thankful for it."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I don't like anime, but Spirited Away was an awesome movie!"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,But how did she know what pigs her parents were????
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Second this, anything miyazaki makes is gold."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I watch a good amount of anime and really disliked Princess Mononoke.

On the other hand I love Spirited Away and The Iron Giant, also enjoyed my neighbor Totoro."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Even more excellent movie if you liked those two: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Girl with lives in a post-apocalyptic world with a huge poisonous jungle spreading across the whole world during humankinds last years.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,spirited away was one of the few anime films that i enjoyed
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Someone who doesn't care for anime here. ""Spirited Away"" is a goddamn amazing film."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Just make sure to get the one dubbed by 20th century fox.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,my neighbor totoro is th shit
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I enjoy them a lot, but I watch no anime. Just got the 2012 collection for christmas. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I've seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, where should I go next?"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Especially 1 also ಠ_ಠ Pretty much anything directed by Hayao Miyazaki is fucking amazing.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"It's not that I don't like anime, I just haven't seen much of it and don't seek it out, but for others with limited exposure to it, Akira is definitely something to experience, if not for the story than for the explosions, and the DVD has ridiculously superhuman pencil tests."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Watch My Neighbor Totoro.

The feels in that movie. Ugh.


Also, watch The Grave of the Fireflies if you wanna cry like a little school girl."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I love Ghibli, but I think Howl's Moving Castle is my favourite. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"My neighbor Totoro is the best in my opinion. I watched spirited away when I was little, so I got scared shitless by it"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,you haven't seen #3 ??????? - man you are losing a half life there 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"don't you dare call Miyazaki anime. 

That's blasphemy."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,hehe
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I'm not going to say it's bad or anything, but I just don't understand the devoted fan following of the nightmare before Christmas."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,How dare you compare Jack to Slenderman.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,:') so much feels

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Playing Limbo. Kid takes off shirt.

I WORK OUT!"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Wow, I just clicked this with 23 seconds left. I didn't even have a chance to look at what it was, but I tried to buy it based on your recommendation, and when I got through to payment the discount had gone. Dammit."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Care to explain more? I'm thinking about getting it and am curious why you think so. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I once tried playing it off. A lot more black than I'd expected. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Sorry. Didn't realize I had left out ""PC or"". I don't own a PS3, but your input is appreciated nonetheless. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Yes, but wait for a sale"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Ah, my bad."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I dont give it that much credit. It was _brilliant_ before the spider. after that it became mediocre and by the time you start seeing factory stuff it turns into '101 ways to kill a kid' -simulator. 

Now compare that gameplay against all those 'ooh aah how artistic' -articles there was about limbo at the time. 

I was very disapointed and when the end credits rolled i just quit the game and uninstalled it. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Almost all? Which one/ones didn't you like?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,+1 for Totoro
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I got this movie for Christmas. Already watched through it once. I also got The Brave Little Toaster. Nostalgia at its finest. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I didn't like Totoro. It just seemed like an elaborate setup for Cat Bus.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,MMMMRRRRROOOOAAAAAAAAAOOOWWWWEERRRR
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I have a special place in my heart for ponyo after watching it high as all fuck
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"If you haven't, I'd highly recommend reading the source material Howl's Moving Castle is based on (the book by the same name by Diana Wynne Jones). As much as I love Miyazaki, and as much as I hate being the angry neckbeard who yells ""the book was better!"", the book is a completely different (and IMO much deeper and more emotionally compelling) experience."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,My favorite too was a spectacular movie
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Finally saw this movie last night. Loved it! I can't wait for the sequel next year!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Aw yiss motha fuckin Porco Rosso. I absolutely loved that movie.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Could you give me a rough synopsis? 

edit: I don't know if synopsis was the right word to use instead of summary, I just wanted to sound smart."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Ponyo is pretty awesome too... Has a surprisingly star studded American voice cast if you haven't seen it...
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Princess Mononoke is in my opinion his best film.  Also my favorite of all time...  
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I think their story is so different it had be emphasized in the tone of the movie. I mean Mononoke is a much darker story and the scale of it is so epic it had to be a different style and not as lightheaded and free as spirited away. both great movies though . . .
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I much prefered Mononoke to spirited away, though I think both were great. I thought the atmosphere of Mononoke was just much more enjoyable, more like a serious story than spirited away. Spirited away felt much lighter to me."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Ours too. Maybe it was middle school. One or the other, but it was a subbed VHS from Japan, and I remember going home to look up the movie and realizing that it hadn't even been released in the US yet."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Fun story, I had seen a bootleg version of that movie at a friend's house in Japanese (I think) years and years before the American version came out...but I didn't realize it.  Then, several years later, ads for the movie started showing, and I was getting stupid amounts of deja vu before I realized what was happening.  I was really confused for a while."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"""Anime"" is the shortened japanese word for ""animation""... basically a ""cartoon""."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,wow really? what made you dislike it?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,You aren't alone.  I'm an anime watcher and I never understood the love for this movie.  Yeah it looks pretty but I didn't thing the story was all that great.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Didn't like Mononoke?! I want to downvote so bad......
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,This was my very favorite one. A friend and I found all seven of the manga for Nausicaa and bought them at this year's Otakon. Worth the $70 we spent on them.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,It is anime. So what?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,How do people have enough free time to do this? 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Because they look a like?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"Agreed. I was real young the first time I watched it and my dad was tearing up. Although I didn't understand then, I thoroughly understood why he did watching it now that I'm older."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,HOLY FUCK
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,The wait to preorder it after finding out they were making it was the hardest part for me. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Its the loud noise and fast movement when it jabs down that always made me physically flinch. I couldnt help it. It was just such a lightening fast change with a big loud THUD

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"The Adventure Time one was the one that piqued my interest the most, thanks for that link though."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,You clearly need to re-watch it!

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"The puzzles are amazing. You should definitely get it. Also, the sound and visuals fit very well. One of the best indie games out there. You kind of do get stuck on some levels though but once you get the feel of the environment the puzzles become clear and its just the matter of timing. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"No worries, very convincing art."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"The only part that really stands out in my mind is when you reach the Hotel, but that's more visually impressive than anything else.

I hated the trial and error game play, the story was convoluted for the sake of being convoluted, and it was shorter than most flash games.

By far my personal choice for the most overrated game of all time (with GTA IV or Darksiders coming in a very close second)"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I don't think the ending was disappointing, in fact I think the ending suits very well to the overall theme of the game. Albeit it leaves more questions than answers, I just think the creator of the game wants us to fill in the gaps ourselves. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"One of the newer films is based off of the story of ""The Borrowers."" The use of detail in the animation is nice, but I felt like the plot was rather shallow.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,"Grave of the Fireflies.  Good movie, but also the most depressing film I have ever seen in my life.  Pan's Labyrinth?  Psh.  Shindler's list?  Would watch again.  Grave of the Fireflies?  Once is enough to ensure that I know that I can never ever legitimately complain about anything ever again.  Depressing.  As.  Fuck."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Is that not enough?
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,In a similar fashion to Magic School Bus. YOU CAN NOT TAKE YOUR HELMET OFF IN SPACE AND STILL LIVE. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,But... Totoro is probably the most adorable creation ever imagined. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,i agree 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"The animation in Ponyo is some of the best I've ever seen. While it may not be sixty frames fluid at times, the amusing attention to detail (critters... Everywhere. And they're all doing something adorable or funny) is unmatched. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"both are excellent, they're just nothing alike (though i do agree with you, the book is indeed better). "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Dogsbody is another incredible book by her. If you have ever loved a dog, that book will make you cry like a baby."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I read the book after seeing the movie many times, it made me love the movie even more but at the same time want to read the book again an again!"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Sequel?! Where have I been to have not heard this? Thank you!

I have a three-year-old daughter and it's her third-favorite movie, behind My Neighbor Totoro and The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I enjoy it too, but for some reason Tina Fey's lines stuck out as really awful after this many viewings."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I hear that a lot. Did you see Spirited or Mononoke first? I'm a bit biased, saw spirited long before mononoke, fell in love with the manic-insanity of it... the calmness of Mononoke doesn't quite hit the same notes for me as that lovely surreal eccentricity."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Do you remember the name of the bootleg? (Assuming the name is different)
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Yes, but anime is a style of artwork for the cartoon. 

(I'm not experienced in this, so I could be wrong, but this is what I have picked up)"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"It's been years since I've seen it last, so it would be hard to pick out specifics anymore. The main thing I remember disliking about it was that the story just got progressively more and more ridiculous. Also, I couldn't get into the story or characters in the first place, I found them all boring. That combined with the stories progression made everything turn from plausible (within the stories confines) to be annoying to watch and follow."
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Curse you differing of opinion!
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,the manga is great. The movie is only part of the manga series. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,that term just has a certain neckbeard quality to it
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I screamed like a bitch when I encountered the first spider. That game was not made for arachnophobes. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I was waiting next to that for about 20 mins trying to figure out how to do it without going anywhere near the spider.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"I didn't love the puzzles so much - what i really loved was the feel of the game, the way the creepy sound and flickering backlights made me feel out of place. What I meant by the puzzles is that at the start you run through a forest and get creeped out by the scenery - a hanging corpse, man traps, bodies floating in a pool, ect. But at the end, there's a lot of puzzles and that felt like.. well, a £2 indie platformer. Make no mistake though, it's a brillant game. "
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,Hotel sign gave feeling of awe. Only positive emotion in that part of the game. Level design was quite..erm. Horizontal? 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Yeah, the ending was really good. It was just the puzzles that I hated... It turned it from having an atmosphere to a sidescroll puzzler.
"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"The ending scene was fine. All between killing the spider and seeing the ending itself was bad. I dont mind leaving things to imagination. 

I wish there would have been something else as content. Perhaps a story about other kids who try to stop you all the time?"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-31,Whaaaat! That was one of my favourite movies. :(

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Ah, hadn't even heard about that one. I'm going to assume it's because of the lack of Hayao Miyazaki."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"ew, testicles everywhere"
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I see. From the other replies it seems that there are a few of their movies that aren't worth recommending anyway. 
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I'd recommend any Ghibli film made by *Hayao Miyazaki*.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,It also disregards the book it is based on pretty much.
15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I'm pretty sure it was done by Miyazaki's son. Felt weak and i couldn't really get into it.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,I watched Spirited Away first and loved it. I then watched Mononoke 5 years later and was blown away. I agree that people usually love the one they see first but I was mesmerized by Princess Mononoke.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Miyzaki's work, and Studio Ghibli's generally, doesn't conform to the aesthetics or story telling tropes of Japanese anime (and is probably referred to better as Japanese animation). While thematically different, Miyazaki especially pulls from the great Japanese film directors like Kurosawa and Ozu (there's actually a fantastic video of Miyazaki meeting Kurosawa near the end of his life [and the beginning of Miyazak's career]) on Youtube, if you understand Japanese.

Studio Ghibli generally also pushes back against a lot of the tropes of anime in a very guided way. Japanese anime really begins with the manga of Tezuka Osamu and in some way or another all anime really goes back to that well. Miyazaki personally blames Tezuka for the poor visual quality of Japanese anime - you can see this in the very distinct Ghibli art style as well as the emphasis on fluid motion. In it's stance against the objectification of women and the valuing of old Japan (rather than fetishizing it) Studio Ghibli in general and Miyazaki in particular (especially early in his career) differs thematically from anime.

Finally, in Japan Ghibli tends to be treated more like film and less like anime. I'm not saying you can't buy Totoro plushes in Akihabara (you can), but the same distrust and disgust most Japanese have for nerdy anime (Gundam, Evangalion), or the kids basement relegation for others (Sazae-san, Doraemon) is completely absent from Ghibli's work."

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"By western nerds like you.

I majored in Japanese and lived in Japan for four years. Ghibli's out put is treated more like film and less like ""anime"" - either nerdy stuff like Gundam or children's stuff like Dragonball, Doraemon, or Sazae-san. I did academic work on Kurosawa, and have a pretty good understanding of Japanese film history.

I've been watching anime since I was a kid (and that was a long time ago) so I'm sure I can beat your ""assload."" On top of that I've watched stately samurai films from the 40s and 50s, little known pinku directors from the 90s, chambara exploitation films from the 70s, and I know where Ghibli fits in in the worlds of Japanese animation and film. Ghibli is different from ""anime"" which is why it's held out as special both in film and animation. In Japan, Miyazaki is not really an anime director - he's just a director. Ghibli trancends and supersedes anime to become a part of mainstream film. Of course, that's impossible to tell when you don't speak Japanese and all your experience is from downloading subtitled Naruto from bittorrent.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"Anime covers all animation. Your friend is right. Miyazaki is anime in the same way Pixar is anime. In short, it isn't. 

That's why I suggested the term Japanese animation as anime has different nuance in English and Japanese. While you could use the word anime in Japanese to denote Ghibli the word doesn't mean the same thing in English, much like otaku is a specific kind of otaku in English and not in Japanese (you can be an aquarium otaku for example). In either case Ghibli stuff isn't anime like Gundam or even the artsy anime like Satosho Kon (Paprika, Millenium Actress). 

The way your friend is using anime it would cover on Japanese everything from Ghibli to Tom and Jerry (if you're old enough to remember that). However in a particular sense Ghibli isn't treated like Japanese anime - like Gundam or Doraemon. 

As to Wikipedia the entire culture around Japanese anime is written by Western nerds. However from a film perspective it is obvious that Miyazaki is working from a film perspective and not the anime lineage going back to Tezuka. 

And yeah based on your comments about Muslims it kinda seems like you're down on Muslims. In any case if I sound upset your one friend and Wikipedia don't really rank as sources to me as I've been studying this stuff academically since 2003.

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"ah that would explain it. Tales from Earthsea was one of those films where you have to read the books to understand, wasn't too fond of it but still enjoyable :)"

15o3l6,2012-12-30,2012-12-30,"It's actually true. I know one of my ex's parents watched Tom and Jerry and refers to it, generally, as anime. I don't think they still show T&J on TV in the U.S., but I was at the very tail end of being able to see it on TV during childhood, likely (partially) due to the violence.

So, I understand your perspective that anime is a medium, but I still don't think it's correct. If we're speaking English, animation is a medium. Ghibli is animation. Pixar is animation. Naruto is animation. Anime refers to a specific subset in English, of which I would count only the last example. For many Japanese anime is the same word as animation, but the culture around anime would be the same - excluding the first two example.

As for the Islam thing your response to this comment:

> For that matter, I can say that any religious institution, Islamic or not, creates an environment were extremism can grow.

Was this:

> Islam just seems to be really good at it.

If Islam were better at growing extremism, the world would be on fire. Islam is the second biggest religion and yet there are only handfuls of extremist (which, by the way Christianity has had too - see the Crusades, the Mormons, almost all of Europe's historical wars had a religious element). In fact, if you read Japanese history, Buddhist monks (!) were considered militaristic and players in both war and politics (which is why Nobunaga destroyed temples when conquering Japan).  Between the huge Muslim populations of Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia (all relatively mellow Muslim countries) if Islam were BETTER at promoting extremism, we would be in a constant world war.

Instead, the effects of colonialism especially in India/Pakistan and the Middle East are much more specific causes for extremism which then co-opts religion."

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-23,You're asking why they don't include an infinite number of art styles?
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-31,It's mainly a mod for people who have already played a hell of a lot of Dark Souls and want something new.
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-23,No. Paying attention to your surroundings is the most important thing you can do in souls. It's one of the main reasons most people have to use guides because they are too stupid to use situational awareness. This would make the game harder.
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,Nobody would know that until they read your comment

IMO, limbo was way better.  The puzzles were a little more clever and fundamental.  And harder.  I felt like Inside was way too easy."
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-23,"It would be cool, but it's often impractical.  These sorts of filters would take time and resources not only to develop but (more importantly) ensure that they work properly.

A lot of people might see some major graphical issues resulting from a goofy bonus mode and call the game out on it.  Gaming sites would call the game sloppy, etc.  Lots of risk for no tangible value in sales."
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,The season 2 finale of Vikings was like this. There were times when I honestly couldn't tell who was killing whom.

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"The murakumo, it's the same weapon basically, but instead of the gimmicky HP Regen it had way higher base damage and a B in dex. It's a monster and has one of the highest poise damage stats of any weapon"

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"> (more importantly) ensure that they work properly.

Yes, this is the big one. Mods don't have to go through an extensive quality assurance process that game features do, and if it gets fucky or there's parts that are broken/unbeatable, you just uninstall the mod. You can't do that with game features without it being at LEAST a huge PR nightmare (and at worst actually affect sales of the game or future titles)."

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"the Murakumo was my absolute favorite weapon,  i couldnt bring myself to use anything else.  too bad they changed the moveset so much in the next two games,  i really didnt like how it became."
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"I tried it a bit in 2 when the recolored blue one got released, but I didn't like the Curved Greatsword style. In 1 could it chain stun people to death? I remember Server was amazing at that. "
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"One of its attacks deals mostly physical damage and is easily blocked.  Its other attack deals mostly magic damage and needs to be dodged with decent timing.  Without the particle effects, you would also not be able to see the telegraph on the explosion before it lifts off again."
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-23,"I mean, you could also do a faith build with soothing sunlight and sanctus and make a build around it, but that's gimmicky as hell."

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,Right? DS2 murakumo was a shell of its former self...
5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"Yeah it could. In DS2, the murakumo got a harsh nerf so it didn't do as much poise damage. For good reason though, as poise damage was OPAF when the game first came out "

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-23,"Yeah, I had so much HP that for me it wasn't worth, but for a lower HP build I can see it being worth the hassle."

5ppl03,2017-01-23,2017-01-24,"I think they made it feel a lot heavier,  which is more realistic...  but it makes it so much worse.  "

2e5s12,2014-08-21,2014-08-21,"I dunno.  The special edition is PC and Mac, though.

The cut outs in the eyes make it seem like it's specifically meant to have a light source shining through to match the character design in the game.  Considering how common it is for the sticker placement (http://www.macdecals.com/), I just find it somewhat feasible that they had it in mind."

Also, you can replace most parts in a Macbook Air, it's just harder than most laptops. (Most PC laptops are getting thinner and lighter similar to the Macbook Air. Soon most laptop will be like it) "

8aljbb,2018-04-07,2018-04-08,I'd recommend playing it or watching a lets play its got a wonderful aesthetic that looks a bit creepy but doesn't result in a whole lot of terror. Its just a fun puzzler that feels rewarding to figure out its puzzles  
8aljbb,2018-04-07,2018-04-08,Please watch a let's play. It's only 30 minutes to 90 minutes depending on the skill and editing. Great journey
8aljbb,2018-04-07,2018-04-09,It's about a boy who died and is stuck in the world of limbo. He continues to seek for his sister so he has to go through all these obstacles and puzzles. He eventually finds his sister but I guess the big reveal at the end is that she's also dead. Lots of people theorized that they both fell from the tree house and died and they both didn't know they were dead.

Also great drawing, captured the style perfectly!

EDIT: One thing, if you liked Limbo, try out this freeware indie title. It has a similar 'mysterious' atmosphere, but focuses more on exploration.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Take all the upvotes I can muster, and then some!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Something about this game is just so creepy to me... maybe it's those glowing eyes? Nice work, by the way! :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You should play it. It's unbelievable. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"This is beautiful, well done! I had never heard of the game before, but after seeing your art and watching some vids, I may just have to get it, looks awesome...  Thanks for sharing :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Hmmm... I think I am going to feel forever alone for that boy when I play Limbo from now on
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,i loved that game.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,I love this. You captured the style perfectly... and I'm glad you chose the forested part; the city parts start to get a little too creepy for me! I hope I get to see more artwork like this from you <3
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Honestly that entire game was extremely stressful but so worth it. The end kinda hit me by surprise but I still loved it.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You have inspired me to buy this :)
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"It looks like you have hoodies on, or raincoats. Your pic makes me think about the possibilities of dual exploration of our unconscious minds, not unlike Eternal Sunshine. Really enjoying it. Nothing like exploring the world/virtual worlds with the one you love. Keep it going!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Your pretty picture makes me interested in the game :)
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You are awesome. I hope he thought it was awesome.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"that's cute as fuck
"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I wish I had thought about gaming before I bought my laptop :c I can hardly play anything except lame little seek and find things.

this is really neat"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"You just made me melt, girl.
THIS IS SO CUTE.
You give me hope for finding a cute girl to hold hands with and wander around a dark dangerous woods..."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Looks fantastic. Any chance of a higher resolution?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Nice work! 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Pretty cool pic! I like! 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,this is... lovely.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Blah blah white knight blah blah.

Are you and your boyfriend... how shall we say... black with white eyes?"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,That is beautiful and adorable.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,This made me as happy as when I first played the game. Thank you!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Looks exactly like the game! So fun to play.
-Also made this a background on my laptop ^^"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Do you have this in 1920x1080 ? :3 i'd love it as my background !
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,That is so cute!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Not sure if creepy or adorable...

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,I found this game to be absolutely stunning.  Adorable picture!

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Its like Ico meets Limbo. Awesome Job!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"that game should have been much longer, with more forest and atmosphere. I loved the first half, the second half was challenging but was just a gauntlet of puzzles with no rhyme or reason.

more creatures, more ""oh shit"" moments. "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I decided to buy this game and give it a try.

This game is apparently a drowning simulator.

...nevermind, I figured it out.  Derp."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,It looks just like you guys?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Wow! These comments are amazing. HammerBunny - Great stuff!

If OP was the girl featured in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/n9bfw/what_my_girlfriend_missed_while_playing_skyrim/), these comments would be completely different. 

I learned A LOT about r/Gaming from these two threads. "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,really nice work.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You guys are going the wrong way!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"That looks very nice. Send it to the developers of Limbo, they'll love it. I'm sure they have a contact page on their website or something like that."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,I wish *I* had a girlfriend...
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"thats awesome, are you using a tablet? what kind? and what program did you use? just curious >< "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,U kiddin me?  You just gave me the coolest desktop wallpaper!!!!  You have mad skills always remember!!!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Loved this, well done. "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Watch out for the giant death spider.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Lucky guy! :D
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"If he's got sense, he'll propose soon enough."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,I now have a new desktop background *as eyes water*
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"I bought this game. And then played it like 5 minutes. Because spiders scare the living shit out of me. And that game right there had one of the ugliest and creepiest spiders I have ever seen in any game or movie. I'v gotten over the fact that every RPG for some reason needs to have big ass spiders dropping on you out of no where. I've survived the fat wobbly ones in Vanguard and the disgustingly hairy ones in Skyrim. But this game takes the cake. It's a ten on the spider creep scale. 

And so this game shall stay unfinished forever."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,I think it's cute 8)
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"*Me and my boyfriend

I like the drawing though"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,i love this game's (and your drawing's) atmosphere 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Myself, I drew my boyfriend and myself"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,This is amazing. Way to be awesome in so many ways.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,That's sick!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"I once showed it to a girl and she just thought it was scary. 
I'll keep trying."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Limbo+Ico, yeah I'd play that."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"This is the first time my wife has actually paid attention to reddit, she wants me to buy the game, repost on face book, and up vote you with the force of a thousand suns..... wonderfull  drawing, can I use it as a desktop and claim it as my own?"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"This game was wonderful and depressing at the same time.

If you draw the two of you ripping the final leg off that spider I won't be able to tell if that's adorable or terrifying."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Saw this thread earlier and decided to give Limbo a try. Bought it, beat it, loved it. Thanks for perking my curiosity!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,I made this my desktop background. :0

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,I am thoroughly enjoying your drawing. Thank you.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-16,"I just got Limbo today since it was on sale, holy shit it's awesome which was kind of surprising for me as I'm not usually into the 2D side scrollers. Pleasantly surprised and I would recommend it as a must have. "

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,How... Romantic ಠ_ಠ
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Limbo is one of my favorite games ever. The artwork is incredible, the gameplay is perfectly placed, dark, and yet humorous too.

It is also a great game for people who aren't good at video games. My uncle almost beat it, and that is the first time in a long time he has been able to figure a game out."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Is he leading you off screen to ravage you?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Love it.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,this is SO awesome and adorable. Makes me miss drawing digitally D:
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,That is incredibly sweet. Print it and hang it up somewhere in your place. It's too nice not to. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Did Limbo ever get cheaper? I want to play it/buy it, but they were asking $15 for a four hour indie game. No amount of artistic-ness is worth $15 for four hours.

Can I get it for 360 or PS3 for $10 or less? Other than Terraria (for obvious reasons), I hate playing a 2D platformer style game without a game pad, so a PC version is a last resort."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,thats cute :)
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,i loved that game.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Did you draw it on top of the screenshot?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Awesome! Id love if you would share a high res version! 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Anyway to get this into 1440x900, I'm seeing some serious desktop potential here."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,thats probably the one world i would NOT want to get stuck in with my boyfriend <_>
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You forgot the spider!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Ooh, coop in this would have been very interesting. Nice drawing/painting. :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Rawr
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,This is a beautiful portrayal of an amazing game - Very well done!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"That's adorable, you have a nice style and such. :]"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"You know you could pass that off as a screenshot of Limbo 2 and people would believe you.

Well done."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"The fact that the story of Limbo is about a guy going around in an eternal loop, following his dead girlfriend to her grave which he may or may not have put her in makes this a bit creepier :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,This drawing is really going to make you sad after he leaves you.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"you just gave me a new game to play with my GF, thanks!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,totally making this my android desktop
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"> boyfriend & I

boyfriend & me"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,This makes me feel so much worse about my feeble attempt I made 2 years ago. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"When I played Limbo my thougths kept going back to ""What Dreams May Come"" by Richard Matheson.  "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I think you mean ""I and my boyfriend"".  That makes more sense.
"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Now draw you and he as you would be in the game Catherine!  It's a game about a relationship, a nightmare...and butt demons.  Ir's sort of messed up but the Demo is free to download and it rocks!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I don't think it's different enough to Limbo's actual art to be interesting. To me, it seems kind of unoriginal. I'm obviously in the minority though, so don't be discouraged if you read this; it's still good, otherwise you wouldn't be on the front page :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,boyfriend and *me*
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,That would be the worst date ever...
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,Are you guys holding a ball?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"I only played the demo, but it seems you are going the wrong way."

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"I just saw this post yesterday, I loved the art style (very well done, btw!) so I looked into Limbo a bit more and added it to my steam wishlist...and today it's on sale for $2.50!

Beautiful picture, I wouldn't have even considered looking into the game if it wasn't for this pic :-)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Awesome. Do you, by chance, own a site/deviantart/tumblr/whatever? Just wanna see more where that came from."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-19,Hi! I love your drawing :D I hope you don't mind if I use it as a stencil thing :) I'm gonna make a christmas artsy gift for my boyfriend ( we also play limbo together) ;] Just want to tell you because I might post the finished project up on /r/crafts 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Love it so much!  
I love playing games, but this one I had to run through like 5 times just for the heck of it!  I shall share this. :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Aww~

Kind of reminds me of ICO."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"It's funny but in your title your grammar is actually wrong, it should be ""me and my boyfriend"" in this special case. Contrary to popular belief ""my friend and I"" is not always correct. The sentence should make sense when removing the second person, so here it would be ""I drew me/myself exploring..."" not ""I drew I exploring..."""
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"You're both freakishly short.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,*me. Very nice!

Seemed more fitting for Limbo..."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Agreed, OP's work has inspired me to get this game."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"In a program called Painttool Sai, I painted the background with the watercolor tool, then i used the pen tool to make the foreground (the black parts). After all that, I exported it as a .PSD.  To get the shadowy, black ""glowy"" effect you see around the grass and us and the foreground in general, i made a duplicate layer of the foreground and used a filter called ""Gaussian Blur"". it really gives it the ""limbo effect"". I also gave it a little ""noise"" so it looked snowy in the background like the game :3"

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,It helps that the game was exceedingly short.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,i was thinking about adding his disgusting repulsive hairyass leg on the right
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,i had plans for that actually!~
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I really appreciate that, thank you so much!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,OH YOU <3
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,How exciting! HAVE FUN! :D
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Im glad you noticed, yes, we both wear hoodies nearly all the time now that the weather has changed. We live together. We do everything together and we never really seem to get enough of it.<3 thank you for this, im happy that what ive done inspired some thought"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,He really liked it. He's always so supportive
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,YOU DO THAT. you do that. DO IT FOR LOVE :')
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,upvote. would look great for my wallpaper
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Im currently trying to figure out how to make it larger without losing the sharp lines and quality :(
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,for sure! thank you!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"thank you so much, i dont know HOW i got all this attention but i must have done something right ;-; thank you again"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"yeah, sometimes I wonder about the people you saw die during the game (or lead to their deaths). what happened to them? did they wake up somewhere else in the world like you did, or in an even darker, deeper, worse place than before? maybe they stopped existing, or continue to exist in the same spot as before, doing the same thing, unable to break the cycle of events that killed them.

I wouldn't want any of the mystery explained, but I would wish that there had been more events in the background, more content, that raised questions and made you reflect."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Okay, I beat the game.

WTF CLIFFHANGERS.

Still a great experience, although a bit short.

I think it could've benefited from more creature interaction - that bit with the dog was great :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,indeed~
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,They just want the achievement...
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"guh, i really should. I would die if they replied!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"i used painttool Sai and photoshop elements. As for a tablet, i use a wacom intuos 3"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"we've talked about it, hehe <3"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,drawing my boyfriend also myself as well
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Tell your wife I said ""YOURE THE BEST"" also you can make it your desktop i dont mind. I am honored."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Yeah, ""I"" is never correct.  (quick test, remove the first subject and see if it still makes sense):

""I drew I exploring limbo""...
"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Either is correct. Her way is incorrect. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"In this case, the reflexive pronoun ""myself"" should be used. As in:  
*I drew my boyfriend and myself....*  
Had someone else done the drawing, then ""me"" would be OK:  
*chvor drew my boyfriend and me...*
"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I believe the correct usage would be ""I drew my boyfriend and I exploring Limbo"" but 'boyfriend and myself' would probably be fine for most people."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I believe the correct usage would be ""I drew my boyfriend and I exploring Limbo"" but 'boyfriend and myself' would probably be fine for most people."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Aww, thats adorable. Thank you!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Its so sad, my dad really tries his best to play games like modern warfare and halo, but the controls seem to be a little too much for him and, sadly he gets motion sickness really easy. I'm thinking i might get him this for his steam account. "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,well duh~
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"You should continue!!!! I know i couldnt live without it. literally haha, its my job at the moment"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I made it for him while he was sleeping and when he woke up i surprised him with it <3 i was thinking i should put it on the fridge, but i thought thats a little cliche. Maybe in a small frame above our bed? hmmm"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"It was $2.50 on Steam a few weeks ago, and if you already have a 360 and a PS3 all you would have to do is plug a controller into your PC to play Limbo with it.  Of course, this doesn't work if all of your controllers are wireless.

Steam has another big sale coming up on Tuesday, so Limbo will probably be around the same price then."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"No sir, this was digitally painted entirely"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,I second this!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"id love to, and i see many requests for it, but im not sure how, as it may trash the quality ;-;"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"    Ooh, coop in this would 
    have been very interesting. 
    Nice drawing/painting. :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"i wish that the creators, PlayDead, would take me on. Id do anything. Get their mail, pour their coffee... anything :C"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Dude, fucking spoilers. I hadn't finished yet, and neither had the OP."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,whoa. goosebumps.  @_@
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,hopefully that wont ever happen.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You two have a fun time <3
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,my hero
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"No... ""My boyfriend and me."""
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,Butt....demons??? whoa now
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"How is that proper again?

Last time I checked 'Boyfriend and I' was proper."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,or the most thrilling~!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,grammar correction fail
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"""My boyfriend and me,"" actually. "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"In this case, the reflexive pronoun ""myself"" should be used. As in:  
*I drew my boyfriend and myself....*  
Had someone else done the drawing, then ""me"" would be OK:  
*NateTheGreat26 drew my boyfriend and me...*
"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,*myself. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"We have great fun.
Sometimes I even make the couch all cozy with blankets and pillows so i can fall asleep watching him play Skyrim."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,oh no!!!! 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,have you ever played Knytt?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Its not. In fact, if you'd like i could break down the image, layer by layer."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,dont. tease. me. I WISH i was a part of their team.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,well thats awkward :|
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"The grammar bothered me too, but you didn't have to be such a fucking douche about it."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Plenty of dudes gushed about this shitty game as well.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,wut
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Have you never played a co-op game? With two players you are 1000% likely to ""accidentally"" push your partner into a trap."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Paint me like one of your Limbo characters, HammerBunny."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"What was that tilde for? Sorry, complete newbie in... using tildes."

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,[deleted]
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Very cool. Thanks for the diy tips.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"aaw yeah paint tool sai! I recommend Art Rage too, if you like SAI. The blend tool is the best out of all the art programs I've used, hands down."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"my heart melted, lol "
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Copeland reference? 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Fucking onions.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Got any like minded friends? haha

Thanks for the uplifting words :D"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"The way they kept ramping up the gameplay and puzzle dynamics, there's no way it could've been sustained for very long.

Yes, it was only 5 hours long, but it was the most savory 5 hours I've had in gaming in years."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Upvote for the truth my friend, hang in there, it gets better!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Pretty good way to sell the game, right? Right?!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"When playing through it, I occasionally saw my girlfriend watching too. I understand why, it's a tremendously beautiful game that has the depth of a movie."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,hey there. serious question. what's it like? I've never heard of it until now but my wife and I occasionally like to get into a co-op game. is it approachable for a non-gamer? thanks!
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,this is beautiful
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,:D thank you. I just hope you know that your beautiful drawing is what is making me want to play this game right now! :)
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,did you use your teeth?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Actually, both are correct. Though increasingly common, and ""more correct"" to many peoples' ears, the English language does not require the reflexive pronoun when the party being referred to has already been mentioned in the sentence."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"What about the good old fashioned, ""my boyfriend and I""? Or have I been grammared wrong all these years?"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,You should be!  Great game. :P  Creepy too haha.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Thanks!

It actually comes from a Nerdcore Rap group, Optimus Rhyme

www.optimusrhyme.com

EDIT: The bassist's name was Stumblebee, and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. There was also names like:

Wheelie Cyberman

GrimRock and

PowerThighs, so I had a pretty hard time choosing the name."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Yeah I was pretty damn excited when they announced their next project. If its anywhere near as perfect as Limbo, it will be amazing I'm sure.

Off to play Limbo again tonight now I think."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,i feel you on that
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Sounds like someone never made it past the spider.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"I'm not sure if that would make me love this picture more or hide this entire post. Such mixed emotions...

Very, very awesome image by the way, can't believe you made it from scratch and didn't use anything from the game itself. Well done!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"can't upvote your picture more than once, so I'll upvote all your comments to make up for it, maybe make several accounts to upvote as well."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Oh, and I read in other comments that someone/thing is downvoting your comments. I'm going to try and balance that out ;]"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"This is awesome.. and even if it's not as high quality, I'd still like it if it could fit as a background :)"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,No worries! Keep up the good work. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,XD i remember that
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Please check my reply to chvor.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,Such a gramma'queen.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,That's the same issue I've been having =/ it seems like the only way to do it is to make it super high quality in the first place. 
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,what a dick
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Well fuck. Sorry, didn't know, it was the first thing I thought about when seeing the pic, so I just wrote it. Anyway, the game is over 1,5 years old, at some point you can't call spoiler anymore."

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-28,Play the Demo - it's unique in a land of cookie-cutter games.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"Actually ""I"" is when you're the subject and ""me"" is when you're the object, but the easiest way to remember it is just to remove the other part of the sentence and make it just about you.  

So in this case, it wouldn't be ""I drew I..."", but rather ""I drew me..."".  If you remember that simple trick you will always get it right.  But trust me, if that's the worst thing that happens to you today then you're flying.

And now I feel like a dick for being such a grammar nazi. :-(  I swear it's a real sickness!"
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,If giant spiders and crushing gears are thrilling then yes! But I guess it's all how you look at it. Haha.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,I drew myself.... yeah that sounds about right. Good call. (Grammar nazi just got trampled by the better-grammar allies.)
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,We should totally elope.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,I have not! good?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-15,"I would actually like that. Not that it looks bad or anything, it just looks ""artificial"" "

Geeky Girlfriend plus indie game plus spontaneous art plus one slight gramatical error, it couldn't be more engineered if you tried.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,The most fun I've ever had in a co-op game was *Little Big Planet* with my brother. I couldn't believe you can have that much fun pushing each other off platforms and leaving one another behind. Or smacking each other around while your sack girl or sack boy dances.

ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,5 hours? More like 2 hours.
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Eh, it's more like 2.5-3 hours on the first run through."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-17,topher?
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Not coop. Amazing game. Mechanics are basic, just jump and grab. Puzzles  are adjusted to logic of the world so approachable to non-gamers for sure, in my experience."
ncl9v,2011-12-14,2011-12-14,"Well, its single player, and it can be a little frustrating as some of the puzzles are challenging. You tend to die alot, but, its definitely worth a try."

3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"I thought it was amazing. The visual aspect alone makes it worth it. Easy controls, tough puzzles, plenty of WTF moments."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,"This game is actually more of a quest, than platformer. If you can't get past some point, you don't have to try over and over again, because it won't work. You just have to find the solution."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,"{spoilerish hints} 1. Avoid getting impaled. 2.The spider makes the ground shake. 3. Look for something on the screen that can be used on the spider. 4. Repeat

{Solution} http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/3519/how-do-you-defeat-the-first-spider-in-limbo"
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"Good decision. I really enjoyed the game, but twas a puzzle game not a platformer. If you couldn't get past this its not worth looking up a solution, the games not your thing."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"""Happiness is not real unless shared with others""... not sure about the fine print on ""others"" being dead."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,Just a regular body I think.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,Body of a child.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,most of it is fun. hence millions of dollars in sales.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,"Ah yes, I too loved riding dead bodies downhill. There was one hill called ""Corpse Slope"", all the big kids went down it so one day I dragged my cadaver to the top. I'll never forget that feeling riding down. The cool wind blowing through my hair, the bloody bits of skin being torn off leaving a smelly red trail behind me. They say you can never really recapture the magic of childhood, and it's memories like that which really prove the point."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,Right click > Show controls
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,I think it's right after he jumps on the body.

3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,Explain please?
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,[deleted]
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,I'm still stuck on that part. Got mad and gave up. :(
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,"I hope, Limbo was one of the best $5 I've ever spent."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"Not that awesome. I think part of what I loved about limbo was that every ""zone"" was basically something new"
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,Same. But if you don't like puzzle games (think portal half-life) you might not like this.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,Only if you lack imagination!
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,That was beautiful
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,why
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"I feel the same, and I played it to the end. I also heard from a friend of mine that you can't get the full ending unless you play on xbox, which 1) would be total horseshit if true 2) not really adding any value to the game in the first place. "
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"If I remember correctly, the start screen changes once you complete the game.  Flies are added where you and your sister were. "
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,I've completed the game and still don't know?
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,I was never really interested in it then got it free and loved it. Great game. 
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-19,All giant spiders was supposed to be a joke. Of course I would also want variety.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,Hahaha oh god.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,Not
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,I bet your friend's uncle works for Nintendo. Can you ask him how to unlock Raichu in Smash? I'll give you my lunch for deets. 
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,I never finished it. Care to spoil it for me?
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-19,I have a hunch they make you change direction when you encounter a beam of light.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-17,"Yeah, things are always better when they're free"
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,Zoidberg?
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"There's a lot of theories, but, in short, both you and your sister have been dead for the entirety of the game.  At the end, you crash through glass, possibly implying a car accident.  

Regardless, the sister that you've been looking for is dead, and was dead when you started the game.  After completing the game, the treehouse is more damaged and flies buzz around where you and your sister were playing. "
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,WE DID IT REDDIT!
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,I'm not sure what people were expecting.  The whole game takes place in Limbo which is literally where Catholic children go when they die.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,Wut the fuck
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"""children who die before they are baptized go there"" because the church didn't want to put them straight to hell like all the other not baptized people. "
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,You should finish the game. It is not that lengthy and has some really clever puzzles.
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,[Here are the before and after finishing the game title screen](http://i.imgur.com/aZ5IJ.jpg)
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"WTF I thought I finished it, is there multiple endings? I'm sure I was missing some hidden areas according to stats... "
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,Oh I was going to finish...but things happened...like Destiny....and soon Witcher 3...then Batman...so yeah...lol
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"There are not multiple endings.  The menu screen changes once you've completed the game, though.

edit: Thinking back, the title screen might not change but you understand what it represents once you see the ending of the game."
3692d6,2015-05-17,2015-05-18,"The screen looks familiar, but I think I forgot all about the beginning and the sister and all, maybe I played the game over too long space of time."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Actually, my mum did the exact same. I quote ""This game is sad. I'm going to make the little boy happy. Happy happy happy."" (She starts jumping around then steps on a bear trap).""

It was perfect. :')"

urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"My step-dad wanted to try a video game out, since he hasn't played any since Pac-Man in the 80's. So I loaded Limbo up on the Xbox, and showed him how to play. I was shocked at how quickly he took to it- he was jumping and climbing and pulling like an old pro. Then he hit the first bear trap, and the little Limbo kid got decapitated.

He looked slightly ill at that point, and set down the controller. ""Okay, I think I've had my fill of your video games"" he said. And that was pretty much the last of his adventures with the Xbox."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,[deleted]
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,She's never gonna see that bear trap on the ground with Mister Fluffles in the way. 
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"What is that, a computer screen for ants?"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Dat Cat :)
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"What have you done?

You will need to buy a new computer now."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Is Limbo any good?  I was thinking on getting the demo.  I think it's 10 bucks on steam.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Awesome game! Turn off the lights, play in complete darkness. I could watch someone play this game in that setting."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Would somebody PLEASE pet that cat!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"You know what game your mom should try? SYBERIA.

My mom used to love that game."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"my mom needed to study/play a game back in the day for a class she was taking.  I gave her Diablo II.  she played that far past the end of the class and ended up beating it.  she would regularly be up till 2-3 AM drinking chardonay and playing that shit.  she has always been that awesome though, and it appears as if your mom is equally as awesome"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"My mom just told me something somewhat related that nearly made my tears wet. This came up because I told her I just bought Ocarina of Time through the virtual console on Wii and how I got that for christmas from her maybe 15 years ago. She then told me, back when I had a SNES she used to practise Mario (Super Mario World) when I was away, but she couldn't keep up and her reaction time was horrible and she never told me because she was embarrassed because it meant so much to me at the time. I'm 25 now and my mom is gray haired and losing her senses."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Bad pic, Great game."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"You monster.  She's been so focused on Limbo so won't feed the cat.  Look at it begging for food, or even just love!"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Is that an Antec 9000?  I have the same case!  Looks like you did the same thing and disconnected all the annoying lights.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"I know the felling, i let mine play Plants Vs Zombies Game of the year edition and she played for hours when i was away."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,WHY !!! why do cats lay in front of monitors??? I find it hilariously annoying.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Hey! This is just a poorly veiled attempt to sneak in a cat pic! ...and I approve.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,I can't count how many /r/gaming pics I've seen today that has also had a cat in them. My cat never does anything reddit worthy.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"My 4 year old took one look at this, and declared the character in it is him, and forces me to play it whether I want to or not. I would have been terrified of the spiders, but if I get killed, he tells me I need to play better and not die. "
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Get her started on Limbo, then let her try Amnesia. "
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,one summer i showed my mom how to use emulation on my dreamcast. she spent the whole summer playing mario and tetris on my dreamcast. i was proud.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"This reminds me of mom's OBSESSION with Super Mario on SNES. Anyone else have their parents play a console more than them? I'd literally ask my mom if I could have a turn and she say ""NO"", and my mom is the most caring person in the world. It's amazing what the wonderful world of gaming can do to us "
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,This game is ~~hell~~ purgatory!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,I'm digging that BlackWidow Ultimate you got there. Kinda looks like mine... wait
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that at the beginning of the game?"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Let's add a cat on this picture to get some yummy karma !
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Wow, I can see her pussy."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,this is only 5 mintues into the game
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Wow. She's a whole 5 minutes into the game!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,On the computer using an Xbox controller?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,How does one hook up an xbox controller to a computer? I'd love to play some Steam games with this. 
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Computer?  With an xbox 360 controller?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"I like how the OP managed to sneak a cat into the photo, he knows us well"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"Xbox controller on pc?
"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"I didn't like that game too much. The sounds and visuals are great, but the gameplay is nothing special and mediocre at best."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"i love it when i see a mom ""gaming"" or being involved in any ""geekier"" typed hobbies. i use to pee myself out of excited when my mom would watch cowboy bebop with me. she thought ""that afro guy"" was so cool."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,KITTY!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Dinner is ruined :-)
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Throw in a no good cat. Reddit loves cats!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Clean your intakes bro, they should be black."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Limbo is an intriguing game. There is so much mystery that keeps playing to find an answer.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,That cat was a nice touch
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,This is absolutely fantastic!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,What really makes this picture is the cat. Adorable.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Of course theres a cat there &#3232;\_&#3232;
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,No reason for that cat to be there except karma
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"So it's good then? I don't know anything about it other than it came in my humble bundle (my first humble bundle, [yay!](http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2084/))"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,is that your cat infront of the monitor?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"i actually started playing LIMBO yesterday, and its been very hard to stop"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,That fuzzball looks a lot more entertaining than that game.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,throw a cat in there cause why not
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Is that the Logitech G110?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,That is really not that far in....
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,She is playing limbo but she hasn't gotten very far.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"I just started playing Limbo and, if I'm not absolutely wrong, I think that point is about 5 mins into the game?"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,How can you play with a CAT in front of the monitor?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,reminds me of my mom with Tetris or Dr Mario.  This is why you don't let your mom use video games.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Pretty sure the point I the game where she is is maybe 10 minutes. Just saying...
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,The cat... subliminal /r/aww submission.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"You covered all the bases with this picture. Very smart, so you get an upvote."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Now show her Spider Solitaire and see what happens.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"So..  this turned out to be good advertising for gamepads, but then I couldn't find a good mac gamepad online.  Anybody know a good one? EDIT:  found out can use a WII controller over bluetooth using a program called Wiigi. Sweet!"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Which pussy are we talking about?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Why is it that the first thing I noticed was the cat? Reddit has hard wired me to look for cats in everything.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"psh that part isnt more than 5 minuets into the game.

Great to see new people getting into gaming and realizing how amazing it is"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Obligatory cat next to monitor. 
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"It's okay, EliteKill's mom, I got stuck on that part too..."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Same thing happened with me and my mum! The only other games I've been able to get her to play (and enjoy) are Rayman and Bejeweled!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Take off that monitor sticker.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,they're up-voting it for the cat!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"When will she be allowed to use the master race keyboard, instead of that filthy peasant controller?"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,That's the first few minutes of the game...
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Put cat on keyboard.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Also, cat. That is all."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,it wouldn't be a reddit worthy pic if there wasn't a cat laying in front of the screen.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Is the cat permanent? 
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,good for you... my mom started with tetris back years ago and now she just play solitaire and occasionally back to tetris...
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Is that a cat?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Thatfuckingcat.avi
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Holy god dude...your mom's got pipes!
"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,My speakers! They died after six years :(
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,I'm so glad I don't have a cat.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Clean your dust filters!

Antec 900 right?  I have the 1200, shit needs to be cleaned every damn week but better out than in I guess =P"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,I like that Antec 902 bro!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Is she using a wireless controller?  How do you enable a wireless controller for a laptop?  
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"In 1988 my mother discovered River Raid on my Sinclair Spectrum.   
She still talks about it now."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,I can't get past the part with the box and the lake. Seriously!? This is a problem
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Your tiny monitor angers me.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,Not very long considering she's only on the first level...
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,She's like 5 minutes into the game.  You can tell based on where she is in this photo.  
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,I let my mom try out Everquest 13 years ago. She is now married to my step father who she met inside that game. 
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,the cat :)
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,I just bought the Humble Bundle and played this one through in one sitting (that ended around 430am last night). Amazing game.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"My mother is obsessed with the Tomb Raider franchise. She's playing it on Playstation 3 and I'm considering introducing her to the Uncharted-franchise, but I believe that she won't last more than 5 minutes with the manual aiming system..."
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,I see what you did sneaking in a cat. Wanting some extra karma are we?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Playing LIMBO was one of the most thought provoking experiences I ever had in a video game.  
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"In 1994 my mother played Super Mario World once and was, like, ""This is stupid.""

And why do cats love to sleep there?!"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"The question is, how long was the cat there?"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"You sir, get my upvote for having such a lovely mechanical keyboard :)"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Obligatory cat on keyboard. 
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,but limbo lasts tops 3 hours... (best 3 hours imo)
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Best part...cat
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,And yet she still hasn't gotten past the very first section of the game.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,You've inspired me to pick up Limbo again. Damn gravity switches.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Your cat seems to enjoy it as well!
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,I just picked up Limbo. Should I play this with a controller?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Seeing anyone play games just makes me so happy.
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,I love your cat
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,Did you sneak in a cat post?
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,I let my mom play Terraria on my account one day. Next day she bought it and has been playing everyday since. Also bought the new humble bundle so she has 8 new games.

urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"> This just isn't real.

Have you ever actually tried to teach a person who has legitimately not *ever* played a video game to play one?  You have the equivalent of two PhDs and 20 years of on-the-job experience with video games.  I spent three hours coaching my father with Goldeneye back in the N64 days, and while he thought the game was an amazing piece of technology and really, really wanted to succeed, he was unable to successfully walk *at all* in that first three hours.

Just walk.  He could sorta look around, or he could sorta strafe in a small area... but the second he got comfortable enough with that and tried to go somewhere, he would end up pointed straight at the floor and spin in a circle.  And it wasn't that he didn't understand-- it's just that coordinating these completely abstract two-handed actions into ""make the guy walk over there"" is a skill that takes time to learn and for which he had no reference.  People who had, say, used a two-analog-stick RC plane would have a shorter learning curve.  Helicopter pilots would probably have some transferable skills.  

Not only did you grow up with games, they grew up with you.  Most of reddit played simpler games with simple control systems when they were young.  Primarily in two dimensions.  With clear objectives and contrasty graphics that made goals and action plans obvious.  You were eased into three-dimensional interactive-physics simulations with two analog sticks, a d-pad, four analog face buttons, two menu buttons, two shoulder buttons, and a pair of analog triggers over the course of a decade in gradual increments.

You never had to go from 0 to 60 all at once.  You had Space Invaders or Tetris to ease you in."

Look at the wall and how there's much more noise in the ""improved"" one. It's partly because it's a .jpg instead of a full raw, but also because I kinda overdid it with the Contrast by Detail feature. Also, reddish tint (I think) because my monitor isn't calibrated and because proper white balance and color is _hard_)

All I did can be seen in the history to the left. Upped saturation a bit, let Auto Exposure handle most of it (the feature gives a well rounded start and sets a few basic parameters that you later tweak a bit, but usually it is pretty accurate), switch on a few filters to suppress noise, and using a slight ""S""-curve on the lightness part of the [Lab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) color space. (Essentially, this lets you adjust brightness/contract/saturation without altering colors in the process. Very useful)

It was my uncle sneaking an NES into the back of our pickup truck in '91  that started it all for me and my brother. (My parents had stayed up half the night playing Mario 1 the night before when we were on vacation visiting him.)"
urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-08,"Hmm, just look at the age of many of the people that develop and write games. A significant number are in their 40s and 50s and are parents.

They've played games for decades and still do...and of course, for each of those people there are countless others of a similar age that have played the games those developers created. Everything from pong, through space invaders, doom and so on until today's games, team fortress 2 and so on.

Perhaps many adults have less time to sit and play games, it is, after all, more the case that young people have spare time, but I'm sure there are plenty of youngsters that don't play computer games, just as there are plenty of 40 and 50 somethings, if not older, that play computer games all the time.

People like Carmack and Newell. Even Notch, at 33, is not exactly a youngster.

As for this ability thing, years ago the media created this idea that kids were somehow ""computer whizzkids"" - farcical really, as kids we knew a bit, whereas our parents had never seen a computer.

But we were anything but computer experts. Today only the parents of dumb kids are dumb - that's how it works. There are myriad of highly intelligent, computer literate adults aged from 30 to 90+ alive today.

Where do you think computers, windows and linux, the internet, playstations, xboxes, iphones and all the software that's been around for the past few decades came from? Outer space?

Your average kid is no better at playing a computer game than your average adult is.

Of course, to get good at a particular game might take several thousand hours of concerted practise - at which point you might get some decent young or old players, but these, whatever their age, are always in the minority. Chances are, whatever someone's age happens to be, they suck at playing games.

It might have been the case when I was 11 that we were the first generation to own our own computers that we used primarily to play games. That is certainly not the case today."

He explained it by saying most games seem to be about destroying things, and he didn't think it was very healthy to play games that are so focused on being as destructive as possible.

But he was intrigued by minecraft, because it was a game about creating things, not destroying them."

Kids from the late 60s and later grew up playing computer games albeit sans internet (but there's nothing particularly amazing about that, it's just reading text mostly or looking at pictures / television)

But, if you do that, you'll find that's exactly what I said when I said they were in their 40s and 50s today :-)

Notch is born late 70s - hardly the first generation of computer gamers is he? He's much younger than that.

However, in terms of computer savvy rather than playing games, you can add a lot more. As I say, the idea that parents today are not computer savvy in general is wrong, it's thinking that is decades out of date.

It'd be like thinking that parents or grandparents don't like pop music (some might, of course) but clearly many grandparents today would have listened to pop music from being teenagers. Many of the people in these early bands (Floyd, Zepp, the stones and so on) were born just after the war so are in their 70s.

When you are old, you'll have played computer games, old people that have never played computer games will all be dead. It sounds obvious to say, but it's funny how many people's perceptions of age forget that old people change every generation just as young people do."

It was a table-top type of set-up, and they patched in a second video feed and installed a 13"" TV above it so the dozens of onlookers could watch the game while two people played...

I don't have any kids, but a lot of my good friends do. And their children are now at the age (or older) when many of us met. We love video games.

urtdm,2012-06-08,2012-06-09,"Well yes, but video games are arcade games :)

Atari 2600 was released in 1977, you'd have been around 9 or 10.

I owned a pong clone before that date, and then here in the UK the microcomputer market took off with ZX81 / ZX Spectrum / BBC Micro et al having dominance - which most kids used to play games, hence eventually the computer / programming side of these machines disappeared and video game consoles started to be the in thing.

But, I wouldn't consider that anything other than growing up playing video games. Unless we're grown ups at 10 or going to the arcade didn't count?

I remember going to a computer club every Monday for the zx spectrum. I was a young teenager, but the place was full of adults too. The fact my parents took no interest didn't really reflect a generation gap as such.

Multiplayer gaming was playing in front of the same TV.

Admittedly my son's being playing games from the age of 2 - at that age he started to read and one of the first things he read to me was 'loading please wait' off of a PS one loading screen :)

But I don't buy the idea here of anyone suggesting their parents haven't played computer games unless they are either around 40 themselves and they are talking about parents aged 60+, or it's simply because their parents  chose not to play games in spite of their wide availability when they were kids and teenagers. No one under 45 is part of a generation that didn't grow up with computers or games - and I think it goes older than that, we're both in our 40s, we're not saying ""Ooh these new fangled smartphones"" are we? I own one, I bet you do, if not it's not because you didn't grow up with them is it? :) 

When I'm 80+ I might not be up to speed with the latest technology, but until then there's no great technology generation gap between me and my kids."

veamo,2012-06-21,2012-06-22,"You have no idea what you've done, dude! Imagine playing something scary like Amnesia or Silent Hill. Then turning off (putting to sleep) the PC and going to bed when suddenly ... the spider moves! And you run away, being chased by it down the hallway, out of the house, down the road, the spider is slowly catching up but there is a channel ahead, you jump it and land on the other side.

In front of you is a wall. You stack some boxes and climb them, looking over your shoulder in case the spider is behind you. You spot a pay-phone and hurry up to it when ""SNAP""! You didn't see the trap on the road. Bleeding from your thigh, you painfully crawl over to the pay-phone. The cord is cut. Fuck. You hear a tapping noise. The spider has crossed the channel. You are bleeding heavily and feel really woozy. 

In surrender, you allow your head to fall back on the grass and are vaguely aware of the spider gently wrapping you in its silk. It's dark and cold in here. You feel a funny sensation in your legs. You try to focus on something real and suddenly your head snaps to wakefulness. 

You're on the toilet. You've fallen asleep and been sitting on it for the last two hours. Your legs are numb and you have a hard time making it all the way back to your bed. Shaking your head wryly at the strange dream you fall asleep as the two shadows on the wall watch you drift into the land of dreams."

The glowworm parts weren't nearly as bad for me. The glowworms seemed pretty harmless on their own (it was all the crazy death traps they walked me into that were the problem!), but the spider was malicious.

veamo,2012-06-21,2012-06-22,"I more felt that the kid was totally ruthless in his goal of essentially moving from left to right. While I technically made the boy do those things it still was the only solution available, as if the designers decided that's what he would do as a character to keep moving onward.

It's like, when you're four, and you think that combining your favorite foods: Mac 'n' Cheese and Chocolate Ice Cream, will make something you like even better. But it doesn't. It creates a really gross mess.

And this is how I feel about these. You see a lot of them on /r/gaming, usually involving Limbo surprisingly. Limbo+Portal. Limbo+Zelda. My girlfriend just drew this picture combining Limbo and Pokemon, what do you think? Well, I think it's bad. Some things are better left separate. I wish some things were just left separate.

Also, it was a $10 arcade title, it's not supposed to be more than 5-10 hours long.

As for the challenge, I thought it was challenging enough to be rewarding. There were a couple of puzzles in particular that I got stuck on for a little while. And I never found all the hidden eggs - I don't think I even found half of them. If you really think it was too easy, try finding all of those things. Or try to get the achievement where you beat the game in one sitting with 5 or less deaths (or something like that, IIRC).

And, of course, the atmosphere. It was enchanting to many of us. Clearly not you, but some people play video games for different reasons than others. Atmosphere and immersion are two of the most important qualities in a video game for me. Other people don't care as much about the game world itself, they care more about a specific, detailed plot, or just about the gameplay itself. Obviously all of these are important factors to various degrees - I think the degrees change from game to game and person to person."

Indie games are one of the few places left in the industry where you can find truly creative and unique games. If you are really comparing Limbo to Call of Duty and the like, then you really missed out on something - and just because *you* didn't see it, doesn't mean it wasn't there.

I'm all for calling games out for being mindless commercial garbage, but only when it actually applies. I can't fathom how you could compare Indie games with so much heart and soul to the hollowed out husk of modern FPS franchises.

Oh well.

P.S. If challenge is really this important to you, try Fez. It's another Indie puzzle platformer, and it's much, much harder than Limbo. Finishing it is pretty hard in itself, but 100%-ing it without any help is ridiculous."

I can compare this idie game to the COD franchise because you sound like one of their fans. Easily impressed by smoother graphics. Not minding that it is just a reskinned game that has been developed thousands of times before.

12wyb7,2012-11-09,2012-11-09,"There is a huge difference between ""smooth graphics"" and ""atmosphere"". They are different concepts, but you are lumping them together.

Call of Duty has smooth graphics. Limbo has atmosphere. It's not just about how it looks. It's about how it feels - how you feel, as a character in the world the developers have created. And it takes much more than pretty graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. It's also about music and sound, about the layout and design of the world, about how the world reacts to you and your actions.

Of course it's all subjective, and not every person will enjoy every atmosphere, or feel the same level of connection to every world. I felt a strong connection to the Limbo world, as did many others. That you did not is again unfortunate, but it doesn't mean Limbo is a shallow game with no atmosphere - it just means *you*, specifically, did not connect with the atmosphere that it does have.

Which is fine. Not every gamer has to like every game. I just think you are a) giving Limbo and other Indie games way too little credit for what they are, and b) overlooking and ignoring certain aspects of these games completely, just because you didn't like them.

And it's not just about nostalgia. These games are far from rehashed ideas from our childhood. They are taking genres, styles and other elements from our childhood favorites, and doing new and interesting things with them.

Are Indie platformers like Super Meat Boy and Dustforce nothing more than a way to ""relive"" our childhood just because they are platformers? Is that all that you see in them? They have so much character and personality - and it's original personality. And they take one of the oldest gaming genres - platforming - and do new things with it. I've never played any other platformers that feel quite like they do, or have quite the same precision controls that they do.

I know I'm banging my head against a brick wall, but I really love these games, and I felt the need to defend them. They give me hope that the future of gaming isn't going to be completely dominated by Call of Duty 27 and the like.

And though I find your tone kind of condescending, I do genuinely wish you could see in these games what I do, because trust me, it's there, and it's a really rewarding experience. I like to share it with other people, so when I talk to someone who can't share it, it upsets me."

Atmosphere is subjective.

I want to be mentally stimulated and have my reaction time tested when I play games. Indie games fall flat of the classics because they keep you interested with progressive achievements and a reason to play. Limbo got me interested with the spider and mysterious children. Then it went completely silent story wise and ended with some girl he found. It explains nothing unless you want to reach and make your own conclusions. Super meat boy became a repetitive pattern after you get used to the controls.

>Super meat boy became a repetitive pattern after you get used to the controls.

Oh, I see now. I know exactly what your problem is. You have a twisted perception on what the definition of a game really is. The way you see it, Limbo and the likes are simply *not games.* This bothers me. Why? Well, I understand the idea of opinions. I also understand that they suck. What you're doing here, however, is not presenting your opinion. You are trying to find issues with a game, issues that make the game unplayable, based off of your idea of what a game is. Your idea is **false.** Every single point that Nonbeing made helped support his argument. Your argument, however, as I can now see, is nothing but the same attempt to prove to yourself that the game is bad because *you* don't like it. What pisses me off is not only your ignorance on the matter of gaming, but your insolence towards those in the (indie) game industry and towards the gaming community as a whole. I don't feel like I should waste any more of my time trying to prove you wrong, which you are, but I do hope that you see my point and understand the problem with your views. Good day, sir."

You have to find the enemy ship's weak points and exploit them while they attack cities to really good techno.

You can fly incredibly fast and hover and even fly out into the universe and explore other galaxies. 

It's short like 5-6 and there's not a lot to see in space but some of the galaxies are stunning.

There's nothing like leaving the local cluster and breaking through the oort cloud and suddenly you see all the distant galaxies hanging still with that low eerie music.

A Short Hike- Charming, simple, easy, relaxing. Small town vibes.

Rollerdrome- Doom mixed with Tony hawk pro skater.

Titanfall 2- Fast frantic and extremely well polished. Insanely fun single player and Multiplayer. 

Transistor- cool world, fun always changing combat. Story is OK.

Hotline Miami- great fast paced gameplay and the music rocks."

That's a 40 hour game."

19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Agree!! It’s short but it’s perfect length for such a game!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,If you haven’t seen the short film version on YouTube you absolutely should!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Game is hard in its own way. I honestly don’t know if checking consistencies on paperwork can be fun but this got close to it.

19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Came here to say this one. After years I finally played it, fell in love with it, and then went through the horror of disbelief that it was already over"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The factory level and the time skip level are still my two favorite levels of any FPS campaign.

19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,It's a must play game for anyone who likes detective/puzzle games.  I wouldn't define it as short though.  Although you may very well play through the game in one very long sitting because it's so hard to stop once you get started.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"One of my favorite games ever. Took me about 12 hours to beat it, so I wouldn’t really consider it a short game"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I love that game and I'm too dumb for that game. Cuz it is not short for me lol
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This game was so good I wish I could erase it from my memory and play it again
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,It’s short if your literally a detective
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"For the love of god I've given this game three attempts and I can't get into it. I get so bloody confused after 15 minutes or so. What the hell is going on??

I feel like I'm missing a key element to make me play on."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Try Chants of Sennar next, same type of thinking puzzles and only about 8-10hrs long"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"I came here to say this. 

Simply amazing. I think it took me about 12 hours 

And Case of The Golden Idol which is similar and also excellent (8 hours)"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,one of the best games I have ever played in my life.

If you compare it to Skyrim I suppose."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yeah Mario 64 was just a little too quick for me 

One hour is just too short for me"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Similarly, ABZÛ.


I remember finishing both and just wishing it could go on a little longer. Some of the most memorable experiences in gaming for me."

19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I was going to post this if nobody else had. Short, simple, but somehow impactful. Really great experience. I think it's the only game I ever got the platinum trophy on lol"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This deserves to be higher. What a fantastic game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I didn't see this but I commented the same thing with a period afterwards because MAN THIS GAME
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I didn’t get around to it until almost 10 years after release - successfully avoiding spoilers as recommended - and it still holds up as a very memorable experience.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,One I feel bad I couldn't get into.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This was way to far down the list.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"One of my fondest gaming memories is of Journey. I was going for the achievement to play with someone through the story, I had found someone and we were jiving with our little sounds we could make. We always waited for each other, showed each other how to do things, it was amazing. I lost them right at the end of the last level in the clouds, I legitimately was almost crying, not because of the achievement but my buddy who I lost. I searched for a solid 15 minutes and eventually gave up, floating my way to the top. As I’m about to reach the pinnacle, there my buddy was, wedged in a corner. I spammed the hell out of the noise button in excitement, soon enough they started sounding off too! We then floated to the end together and I actually shed a tear. I never knew them and probably never will, but they were one of the greatest gaming partners I ever had."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Was going to say this myself. A third one is supposed to come out soon.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Beat me to it. I'd also like to add Inside, Limbo and Forgotten Anne to the list."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yep, I agree cause even with the dlc, both are still only like 5 hours long apiece"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"If you like those you should definitely check out Bramble the Mountain King too, amazing game"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Just replayed it recently, decided to try for the ""secret ending"".  Glad I used a walkthrough, ain't no way I would have found that cornfield entrance."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Yeah I came here to say limbo or inside but they should be in the same comment honestly
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,">Journey

Wow two great titles"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This would be my number one selection for best short game.  Never mind the fact it’s an overall great game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"My wife and I like to sit down with friends and see how they react to playing it. Usually they can beat it in one sitting without help, but it's a crazy ride throughout. So mysterious and fun"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yeahh I was gona say this and limbo , short little treats .  Not sure why it took so long for playdead to make a successor.  It was 13 years since limbo came out, so I was expecting inside to be a little longer tbh"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"There's a game called Little Kitty, Big City coming out this year. Similar vibes."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Honk!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I bought that day one because it looked like the kind of dumb game I'd get amusement out of. Wasn't expecting to actually have to do some logical thinking on how to achieve certain tasks. One of my favorite games to boot up and just mess around in. It's absurdly fun being an asshole goose just ruining peoples' days.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Correct answer! To the point that I wish they made a sequel with more customization and gameplay not only longer but more complicated (but with same vibes).
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,One of my favotite endings of all time.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Was searching for that comment. Should be higher up!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Hjonk hjonk I love that game
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Had me in stitches all the way through. Getting the glass jar stuck on your head and giving it the echoing honk was a real treat!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The sequel also very good
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,The soundtrack was excellent as well.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I still visit Oxenfree to this day. Absolutely adored it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Fantastic game. The story was one of the best I’ve seen in games.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I was just about say the same. Still has one of the most fun gameplay and interesting world I’ve played
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"That reminds me, you can get Catalyst for 3$ on the PlayStation store till the end of the month.

Which... God damn. I get it kinda missed the point and impeccable flow of the first one. But 3 dollarinos? I had NO idea it had bombed that badly."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Why no one has made a similar game or created a totally cool genre out of it is beyond me. 

Mirrors edge was THE next gen game for me.  It was the game that made the PS3 feel like it's truly the PS3 and not just an upgraded ps2."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"The atmosphere, the freerunning, the music. I've beaten this game 5 times and I'm down for another run."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"After Mirror's Edge most FP games just feel so empty. Really droves home the ""floating hands"" feeling when you've experienced Mirror's Edge.


Even the iOS companion game was great. Still salty, that it doesn't work anymore... Mobile gaming backwards compatibility sure is a mess :/


Now by contrast... I never managed to finish Mirror's Edge 2. I burnt myself out on open world side missions and lost interest. "
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I loved the game. But I’ve never been so disappointed in an ending in my entire life lol.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Was expecting this to be higher on the list! I was surprised it ended so quickly haha I think like 8hrs total play time but man were those 8hrs entertaining
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This game still sticks with me and I haven't played it since it came out. Beautiful game and while it does get recognition I still feel like it's criminally underrated and underplayed.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Came here to say this
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Just 5 short years to 100%.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Not to be super critical here but the parable doesn’t belong to Stanley, it’s simply called “The Stanley Parable”. I feel like that’s an important distinction to make lol"

19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I just bought the deluxe edition on the last steam sale. I had my doubts but seeing how high it was reviewed I gave it a shot. It is such a good game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I came in to say Transistor, Bastion is another great game too."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I dig my hole you build a wall

Some day that wall is gonna fall

Mmmm-hmmmm-hmmm-hm-hm-hmmmm-m-mmmm"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Isn't Bastion meant to be replayed, though?"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"This was the first thing that came to my mind once I saw the post.

I wish they made more games in the same world with the same narrator."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Came here for this. And also Inside and Limbo.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,There's a sequel if you weren't aware
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yes. There is a second one. Changing tides, I think"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Was looking for this one lmao, need to pick up the sequel sometime."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The bathtub scene was so sad when you realized what is happening.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Being a shark rolling down a hill is my favorite moment in video gaming history.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The cannery sequence is one of the most brilliant things I’ve ever seen in a game
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Top of the crop for walking simulators.  No extra crap to pad it out.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Same vein, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Should be the top answer tbh

Maybe 2 hours to finish tops and yeah this was a fuckin experience lol"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Came here to say this. Most indie games under 8 hours would work well in this thread, but What Remains is probably the SHORTEST yet most IMPACTFUL experience I’ve ever played. Absolute insane roller coaster of emotions, brilliant gameplay, story.. even includes a little reference to their previous game The Unfinished Swan (which is also good). I didn’t even realize they were the same creators until I saw that ref."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Can’t believe I had to scroll so far for this one. It’s a game that has left a deep impact on me. I can’t forget it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,all their stories were so sad but the big brother who worked at the tuna factory was so relatable with the maladaptive daydreaming this really is the young gen z in the workforce experience
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I never played all of it but the two levels I remember the best are the time travel one and the assembly line one. I should definitely finish this game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,That campaign is so good. I started it thinking it wouldn't be that interesting but it kept getting better and better. Such memorable moments.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Jumping across the ships was awesome. I should replay it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Respawn heard people talking shit about 1’s ‘campaign’ and responded with a banger
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I finished it and wanted so so so much more. Best FPS campaign I've played since Halo 2.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Traveling back and forth in time while fighting was awesome
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Add Republic Commando to it. This game was really great but when the credits rolled i was dafuq that's it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I'll piggyback and say Force Unleashed as well lol. I mean, at the time, it was unlike anything star wars had seen before. I talked about it to everyone"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,It's criminal that we never got a third game
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Has it been long enough that people are now saying FU2 was good? Cause that game was a steep downgrade from the first one.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Force unleashed 2 sucked camel balls compared to the first
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,And inside. Such great games.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"whenever life becomes too stressful, I play A Short Hike"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,How in seven hells did I have to scroll this far to find someone listing this GLITTERING GEM?
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I played through many of the games others have listed here, and I don't regret spending the money on them, they weren't wastes of time, but I'd have a hard time recommending them to others.  A short hike is different though.  It can be a short game, but it can also be a rabbit hole that steals you for long periods trying to uncover every hidden nuance and secret.  And it functions just as well for a way to mindlessly kill some time and chill out.


A short hike has a story, but it's a basic story and knowing the story doesn't ruin the fun inherant in just exploring it's interesting little island.  Secrets and easter eggs are hidden everywhere, and virtually every game mechanic and skill is combined and tested in unique and interesting ways.  If you like cute relaxing games this one is a great option!"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Been played Sail Forth, which has a similar feel/tone.  Longer though."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Want to add to the other comments that this game also has a really good soundtrack with some build up depending on where you are. 
Really a beautiful little gem this one. :)"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,[deleted]
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,To the moon ending gives me a audible “what the fuck” while tears rolling cause dude :(
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,To the Moon is amazing. I started the game at 11pm intending to play it for only an hour and ended up finishing the game in one sitting and going to bed at 2-3am
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,There Is No Game is great
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,Yes. This is one of my favorite indie games. It's a masterpiece.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Wait, the people who made Bastian and Transistor made Hades? How did I not know that lol. Kind of obvious in hindsight too"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Very few games made me feel how Gris did. That game is a beautiful piece of art.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I have never played a game that was so utterly stunning in every frame visually.  Truly a masterpiece.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Came here to say this. I beat it on the Wii U.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Easily the most beautiful game I've ever played. 

Create the most impressive hyperrealistic graphics all you want, there's no beating the utterly incredible art style this game has going on. 

It's fantastic how this game can tell such an universal, emotional story without a single word spoken or written.

 Don't get me started on the OST, amazing compositions, couldn't be more fitting.

An amazing and unforgettable experience, can't recommend it enough to anyone. The best counterpoint to anyone that argues that videogames can't be literal art."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The perfect slice of cozy and sweet and quality
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Donut County is fantastic. Played it one day on a whim while stoned and thoroughly enjoyed the experience
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24," Fun game. Got my daughter to also play it when she was 6. While I prefer a lot of the more melancholic games people have listed, this is a great option for those looking for something quick and silly"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I actually recently convinced my brother's girlfriend to play this! On her apple TV...
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Donut County was such a neat little game.

And like anything neat, you'll probably see an ad for mobile games that use the same hole mechanic, but it's just swallowing up random objects without context. Not even dioramas, just food and bullets on a flat featureless plane, borderline artless in its execution."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,There is no other game that remotely feels the same and it's painful man
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Inside is even better in my opinion. Both of those games are extremely solid
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I thought Inside was a huge improvement!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Glad to see Mark of the Ninja mentioned! Replayed it with developer commentary, it's such a masterpiece on so many levels. Design choices, technical limitations, the way sound and vision works, every aspect of the game was made with so much love and expertise."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Love that game!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The answer I was looking for
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"This right here. Love it, cried."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,... and it's getting a remake!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,My answer. One of the best moments in gaming IMO.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Had to scroll way to damn far to find it. 
By far my most recommended game. Rarely have I cried whilst playing video games."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Short, good, sad."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I cried twice in that game. Truly excellent.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I hope that they make a sequel or DLC where our furball finally finds his friends.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"My four year old was watching me try it the first time and she started sobbing uncontrollably when the cat got separated from its friends at the beginning, I felt like shit"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,What a beautiful game stray was
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I miss that little fella. Great game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,This game had no business being as good as it was!!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,I loved this game. Didn’t expect it at all. I rushed through it before it left Gamepass.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I played it for 50 hours including the DLC lol
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I think some people can't get into it because they don't really hold your hand and walk you through on anything
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This. I wish I could forget it and play through it again.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I honestly consider this THE best game ever made, although the complexity of the control physics will likely cause casual gamers who aren't used to 3D navigation to bounce off.


It's not a short game though.  It's almost insulting to put it in that category.  It's a long game for a puzzle game."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I spent too much time in it for a short game and still have no idea how to finish it. At some point its just started to be annoying so I deleted it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Absolutely loved this game. The art is unreal and the story is enchanting.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Just played it yesterday morning, had an absolute blast, it's so unique."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I'll never have a girl like the adversary and that breaks my heart ...
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,That game destroyed my soul.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Hi-Fi Rush is definitely one of the best games of last year, it  was such an original and well made game"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I am so ready for the sequel when it comes out
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Hard to believe I had to scroll this far.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This was my thought as well. 10 hour game and it was so intense from start to finish.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Excellent game
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Came here to post this as well, aside from the short length that game fuckin slaps harder tham most FPS of its time and partly to this day, you cannot convince me otherwise."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Was looking for this post, while I can agree the game was great. The boss battles were very lacking, and idk if I was the only one but I had expectations of playing as the entire team. But yeah i wish it was longer."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"It was unnecessarily panned for it's length, and as a result is now very underrated. 

I snagged it for like $6 years ago so the length didn't bother me, and it was one of the best experiences I had on PS4. Excellent game."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,You should def check out Bound if you havent
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I used to fall asleep listening to a 6 hour loop of ‘Rain’ from ODST. Absolutely BANGER soundtrack
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This game is so much more than meets the eye. And like. I had no idea until I played it. And I only played it last year!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,and I’ll add Delta Rune Chapters 1 and 2.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Granted that game can take FOREVER depending on how you play. Genocide run really does punish you by making you do endless grinding
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,So much good music packed into a 6-hour silly and heartwarming game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I scrolled way too far to find this
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Loved that game so much that I got the platinum which is very rare for me
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,So innovative. Being emotionally engaged by my own gamepad
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Zone of the Enders is fantastic 
It was one of the few games I played on ps2 and I wish it got a remaster"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,Scrolled way too far for this one. Yes there is a ton of optional stuff to do. But the story itself is stupid short. Even with the lost chapters added to it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Currently playing it takes two with my wife from the same dev and it’s really fun
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,one of my favorite indie games ever and one of my favorite games period in the last decade or so.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Sweet I picked this up after reaaally enjoying robocop.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Nah the length is pretty perfect, one of the most replayable games ever."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Agreed. Took me a long time as a kid just because I didn’t know how to progress yet and you couldn’t just google everything at the time.

On replay now, you realize how short it is."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,STARFOX 64!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,Every Metroid game is a valid answer to this question tbh. They’re so short that many of them actively encourage you to play again with a faster time. They’re some of the funnest games to speedrun for that reason.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Loved it. Just wish it had some semblance of replayability. There aren’t even “save NYC” missions to select once you finish it

Please tell me I’m missing something"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Amazing game but I don't think it qualifies as short. Miles Morales maybe.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I really loved playing Scorn with a group of friends, passing the controller when we got stuck or annoyed. Never would have gotten through it alone though. If it had just cut most of the combat, or made it more like the genuinely good boss fight, it would have been much better imo."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,📖
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Amazing game but not really short though.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,I was searching for someone else with the same opinion. That game is on my top 3 because of just how great it is with so little gameplay
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,NOT short.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Not a short game
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"The soundtrack and ambiance of the first game were phenomenal. The nautical theme really set it apart from other games for me as well. 

I remember reading an interview with the lead sound guy who was detailing the overall direction for sound design in the first game. They wanted to use musical instruments in as much of the background world ambiance as possible. The creeking, groaning and sighs of the Maw was all done with instruments to further develop the feeling of being someplace entirely separate from the everyday world. I think they did a fantastic job with it."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Wanted to say this but I wouldn’t really categorize it as “short”
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,A co-op puzzle in Portal 2 had me like that.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,I wouldnt call portal 2 short tho
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Portal 2 has a vr mod and it's the most fun I've had in VR here recently
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Portal 1 was your first kiss.


Portal 2 was like French kissing. Better, but not nearly as special."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Idk. I like portal 2 even more. J K Simmons added a lot of character to Cave and i really enjoyed exploring the history of the place
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,The Orange Box was a brilliant way to get people to install Steam.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,dan da dan dan da dan dan da dan dan da-dun dan dan
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Bomb?! KOLECHIAN TERRORIST!

DETAINED!"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,GREATEST COUNTRY PROUD!!!!! o7
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I played the whole thing through before I realized it was Matthew Mercer doing the voice for Jack Cooper.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I recently met someone that works for the studio that made titanfall. He told me they were working on titanfall 3 but stopped (I think he said for the Jedi game). But he said they will likely make a 3rd eventually
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I played the game for the very first time just last week. On the time warp level, once I figured out what the mechanic was I was blown away. Then I blasted a soldier point blank in the past timeline, warped to the present timeline, and saw his aged and decayed skeleton fall to the ground. That was the first time in probably 10 years a game has made me audibly gasp in disbelief at how fucking cool a mechanic was. 

Later on you essentially end up playing two maps at once, each with a different set of enemies, warping back and forth between them as you move around and manage each fight at the same time. It's absolute genius game design, they executed it perfectly, and no other games offers an experience like it. 

Honestly that time warp level might be the #1 moment in any single player fps I've ever played."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I absolutely loved those parts of the campaign. The time wrist watch thing was a fresh new gameplay mechanic that didn't get old the entire time we used it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Supposed to be this year!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"You can always read the fable comics, they're pretty good"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Hahaha he said the thing
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Even though  it was real
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,I beat it in one sitting but honestly think I would've enjoyed it more if I had done it instead in a couple different sessions. I was procrastinating some stuff so that also took a toll lol
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,12 hours used to definitely be a short game. Most things I played were about 80 hrs and no DLCs.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"You and me both pal. I thought I was doing great till I was asked to name all the background characters that aren't mentioned, then realized I was screwed."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Chants of Sennaar is currently scratching my Obra Dinn itch, and it’s *really* good!"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,It took me longer than usual to finish Limbo by Playdead.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Try Jusant. It is the closest thing to Journey in vibe I’ve played.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yep, Abzu a lot. And Flower

In fact, tons of ""Exploration"" games: Aer Memories of Old, Alba, A Short Hike, etc"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,One of the most beautiful and cinematic games I've ever played.  The range of emotions that game took me through in a 2 hour playtime is wild.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I recently played Jusant and it is really close to Journey in vibe
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,sadly the third one is made by a different studio and is focusing on co op. co op doesn't mean it WILL be bad but it's never been a good sign
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Man the DLC for the first Little Nightmares had me f’d up when playing it for the first time
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"oh gosh, thanks for letting me know! wishlisted now <3"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23," There's a sequel?  
Sigh.... There goes my sleep again..."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"And the MUSIC oh my goddd, still alive is still one of my favourite tracks ever"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"It’s fine, just fine. It’s not terrible but I prefer the original. I will go back though Catalyst though."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"In fairness, they did just take the servers down."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I think part of it was how long the hype built up with the fans then the game came out and there was no way for it to live up to the expectations.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I feel that was the point of the game. The protagonist is escaping the depressing reality of his life back home. But he is living a fantasy.

Rather than facing up to his problem, he runs away and uses his time as a firewatch to delve into uncovering an imagined grand conspiracy, only for the ending to come and reveal that >!it’s just another sad reality of a previous firewatch who also couldn’t face up to his problems (feeling responsible for his son dying in the cave)!<

The same applies to the chemistry and flirting between you and the other firewatch, she has her own problems that aren’t clearly revealed to you but in the end >!she basically tells you it could never work out and you need to go home!<

It’s a game about the dangers of running away from responsibilities."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I always thought the ending being so anticlimactic was kind of the point of it. Like there is no crazy axe murderer, it's just a sad dude that mirrors the protagonist really well."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I was waiting for some kind of big twist or revelation but instead it just abruptly ended haha
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I loved the ending. I felt so empty and melancholy for DAYS.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I liked the ending. A bit soul crushing. Maybe Im just a little masochistic
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The ending was great! Perfect choice of music too - gets me all emotional just thinking about it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I think the remake doubled it to 10
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Heh, I passed the 5-year mark some time ago.  I should really log in to get the achievement"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Honestly, that scene kinda fucked me up. I was legit feeling bad for the narrator. I began to search the room for anything to do but pushing that button. Even listening to his rambling to see if something happens after some amount of time but to no avail. You have to push it. That absolute silence at the end gave me insane chills."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,IS NEVER THE END IS LOADING IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Empire's Strike Back
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"maybe I'm just slow, but i wouldn't consider those short"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Lewis' scene actually hit harder for me. Poor dude just getting more and more lost in his own imagination. Maladaptive daydreaming is a wild thing.

But yeah, Gregory was a tough one, too - probably moreso for people with children"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I played this with my wife (she watched as I played) and I warned her about it in advance since I had heard about the situation before playing and we were still at a loss. It was difficult to get through, especially because we were in the situation ourselves (not the whole bad situation, just the set up to the bad stuff…shitty explanation but I don’t want to spoil anything)."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"The Suicide of Rachel Foster is another great game with five words in the title, two of which are a person's name."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,You definitely should. It's very short but very very good. You could easily beat it in a day.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"That's one of the things they did best. Making the campaign start off as just okay.

First level you're a standard grunt, no double jump, no power slide, no titan. Followed by a standard fetch quest. Map familiarizing you with the mechanics. Then the campaign just gets better, and better, and better."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Really? I played that game in my early teens and I remember it being so long. But there were a lot of memorable scenes, which might make it seem longer in retrospect"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This one. Republic Commando is a fantastic gem of a game.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I mean, you're running around as vaders apprentice ffs! (Or Domsday if you watched Smallville)"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Also played cocoon recently, made by the same guy. Really neat puzzle game!"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yep, wish there was more to it. I still just climb the mountain then enjoy gliding down. And Aer Memories of Old is another one: love just being an eagle and flying around and wish there was more game to do things"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,Exactly!!! This is the actual SHORT game and one that is absolutely wonderful
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,“For River” is such an insane song
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,Supergiant has a great portfolio of games for sure!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Fret not, the DLC is... coming, probably... I think? I hope."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Third game will be out shortly before China becomes a democracy and fusion power exists in Albania.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,It's one of the few games I took the time to 100%. That one and Hades really stand out!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,That part where you phantom trigger the other brother to avoid drowning. The FEELS.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Some guy in ytube made calculations for entire map - and looks like our little hero goes outside almost in same place, where they was chilling originally. So, with high chances, when he got out and moved to the right - he already found his friends and went to them. 

I hope this will make your live a little bit happier today :-)"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,That ending... I was like: Nooooo I need more
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I’m a 38 year old man, and it got to me too. I had to turn the game off and come back to it later"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Same lol, it's only a short game if you already beat it lol."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Excellent game but I don't think it qualifies as short.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I finally played it last week and went in entirely blind after hearing someone complain that it's a shit game where there is no way to know what to do.

Just talk to people and read the letters on the screen holy they give so many hints, and it's so much more satisfying to piece things together yourself. Hell even if you spam through everything you can read a neat summary with the relevant info back later"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"I should try again..but I had a hard time figuring out how to pilot/land properly…and would always enter a Red Alert I couldn’t stop. And I just get punished with that alarm nonstop until I die. 

I’ve never played a flying sim or anything with those kind of controls…and they seem barely explained and really awkward. 

 

Happened the first 3 times I went to space…and it was the most unpleasant least relaxing think ever. "
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Not sure if you know, the release date was announced to be 21.5.2024."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Plus it looked absolutely amazing graphic wise at the time. I was floored by it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Very much agree. Also bought it for less than $10 and it’s one of my favorite PS4 games. Still looks fantastic even next to current gen games imo.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Other than the side missions and fighting the random symbiote monsters that’s it sadly, I literally reinstalled SM1 and MM just to have some more spiderman content to play"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yeah it isn't perfect in terms of combat, but it's a gross and beautiful game of art.  I enjoyed the puzzles and lack of instruction"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Especially not in vr, godamn does it feel long sometimes with vr on."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"That was me and my ex on the one where you had to fly into the air to hit each other. Took us like 3 hours to figure it out. We were so pissed, that we just broke up right then and there"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I was a proud father the days that my sons and I completed Portal 2 co-op - which included intentionally destroying each other for laughs.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,That would make me crazy dizzy and nauseous
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I gotta go jerk off now
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"You must not be very good at frenching, cause whoahohoboy"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I went all the way to this morning without knowing that. Very cool, thanks. Will make my next playthrough that much better"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"He’s gotta be my favorite VA. His voice is just so smooth. Cassidy in OW, Chrom from fire emblem, Jotaro kujo, all great"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Devastating news. It's gonna have a tough time against Portal 3 for GOTY
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"They stopped for Apex Legends. Respawn completely abandoned the Titanfall IP. They literally renamed the Titanfall universe that Apex was based in, to the apex Legends universe"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"the jedi games are great, love to get more of those but nothing really scratches the same itch that titanfall 2 did. i feel like now, with apex legends bringing more attention to the IP, would be a great time to make a titanfall 3."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Alright, you got me. I'm play TF2 for the first time instead of Apex."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"When the explosion freezes in time at the very end, that could be its own art piece."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I had the exact same reaction, it was mind-blowing how it never bugged out either. I can fathom how it was coded but it was a very polished experience."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Not the first game to try the concept but one of the  best to do it.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"In fact, I think it under stayed its welcome."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"i just played it for the first time recently and when the time travel shenanigans began I kinda laughed and rolled my eyes. Then I quickly fell in love and audibly said ""this is fucking fantastic."""
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I thought Telltale went belly up
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This was a triumph!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,My son's excited though.  He watched me play the first two because he was too scared to play solo so a co-op LN should be a good time.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I was really worried at first but you CAN also play solo, the other character just gets controlled by an ai. So hopefully it will be a similar experience to Little Nightmares 2."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Honestly the sequel was very disappointing, I loved oxenfree and completed it multiple times but oxenfree 2 was just much more boring and the conversations are much more shallow than the first."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"that music when you start the last level... just looked it up ; the Shard (Puzzle).   


wow."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,HOWD I FORGET?? I think my favorite track has to be “Kate”. It immediately takes me back to better days. The only bad thing about it is that I’ll never be able to find another soundtrack like it. Or game
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I think we all do. It was a tight experience with 0 filler. One could argue that Catalyst is *mostly* filler. But I had a fun time with it none the less.

I did feel it took itself a little too seriously for a story that boils down to Xtreme door dashers vs Amazon."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Wait... But you can still play offline, yes?"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I believe that's really it. I think the other firewatch even says that you must have some problems to be there. And as mysterious as the events happening were, they were really just the event of another broken person. The game opens up with what your character went through already, and at one point you would have to return to it. Disappointing but it was just a way for the characters to ""escape"", even if for a brief time, and after it becomes unfeasible they just stop."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"The first time I played that game, I hated the ending. When I played it years later, after having tried to ignore and run from the problems in my own life, it just wrecked me."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"I loved the ending for most of the reasons you described, and Delilah's disposition was critical

After all the two of you had seen and done, why would she want anything to do with you? You don't really know each other and you'd be forever entwined >!by the corpse of a dead boy!<. There were hints throughout the game that she was a struggling, complicated person and the playable character has to figure his own shit out. >!So that's what they do!<. It was depressing but brilliant and believable IMO."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yeah. I think it's disappointing because Henry himself is kind of disappointed. Disappointed that there's no ""big secret conspiracy"" against them, that he never got to see Delilah, and that now he must go back and face his problems head on."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Exactly this. It's a good down to earth game that reminds us that sometimes the truth is just something sad not scary.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,This. The anticlimax was absolutely the point.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Yea exactly
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Hard agree!  I loved the ending.  People usually complain about how the mystery plays out but I enjoy how grounded in reality it ended up being.  Which is exactly what Henry (and Delilah) was avoiding doing.  The game’s story was centered on Henry, not the forest’s mystery."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,oh shit i better get started.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,The Empire's on strike again?
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Transistor 100% was a relatively short game, but thats compared to the grindfest RPGs I usually do. It was an epic experience and fun from start to finish though, and thats rare."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yeah they weren't like triple A length games but Bastion definitely isn't a ""you could beat this in one session"" game. Especially if you tried to do everything."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,[deleted]
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Took me around half a day for the first time. I played it over and over again. I loved this game so much and was so hoping for a sequel that never came.   


There is a remastered for PS4 or 5 not sure but not for pc."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"I was just blowing away, at the time, by the complexity of the lightsaber battling and the force power tree. It was so cool to learn new skills as the game went on, and then those skills were implemented perfectly. I mean, to be able to lift someone with the force and throw your lightsaber at them or throw them into a pit? I think we take those mechanics for granted nowadays, but in the early 2000s it was unheard of.

Plus, I thought it was cool as hell to battle all the rancor"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,"Still the most meaningful button press I think I’ve ever made. 

Maybe tied with firing the second portal at the night sky…"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yes, that scene hit me pretty hard too 🙈 but it was nothing compared to the feeling of having to say goodbye to B-12 in the control room q.q"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,39 when I played it.   It took me like 3 weeks to get back to it after cat falls off
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Right? If you read the first clue in the museum in the very beginning that's enough of a thread to send you on your way. Some of the puzzles were challenging and made you think outside the box a little bit, but I never felt aimless or like I didn't know where to go. If you read your ship log you'll always have something to investigate. Like, it literally even tells you ""there's more to explore here""."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Still holds up really well, played it again maybe about a year or so ago, and was blown away at how well it still plays."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"But like, we can’t even replay the side missions

Just gotta randomly swing around and hope to find enemies? Lol"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,At least you still have the companion cube.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,You legit broke up then??
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGBmkUrXX7c) took me about an hour. Still no idea how I did it. Just keep doing things and eventually it'll happen, but in my head there is no solution."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,That's the Stanley Parable
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"How can anyone be bad at it? The rules are simple. You just stick your tongue in another person's mouth and start whipping it around in circles as fast you can. The more RPMs you get up to, the more points you score. If you are able to get get your opponent to give up, you get to twist his/her nipple.

I'm currently undefeated and no one has been confident enough for a rematch. So, I would say I'm pretty damn awesome at it!"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"He's kind of a chameleon. 

I was in the middle of listening to the first Vox Machina campaign when I played Titanfall 2 and it still didn't hit me until the credits and I saw his name."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Even his rendition of Leon Kennedy was solid
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,😂 I’m not saying it’s for sure coming out but the dev I met said it likely will eventually
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Half life 3 gonna win it, though."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,The servers for Titanfall2 multiplayer(at least for PlayStation) were unexpectedly brought back online Sept 2023.  Sony also dropped the price for TF2 Ultimate edition to $5.  It’s been a lot of fun.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,That’s what I said to him and he told me that wasn’t entirely true. He was a dev there. I have no idea how true this is just what he said. He def wasn’t a decision maker at the company
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"It's a great experience, light-hearted and heartwarming story about a boy and his bot."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I don't even play many FPS games but I can safely say Titanfall 2 really does live up to thy hype. Still remember the campaign fondly years later
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"You're correct, but they were then bought up along with their IP and continued making one or two of their properties. The Wolf Among Us being one of them"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I'm making a note here.. huge success
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"While it definitely wasn’t as good as the first game, I still really enjoyed the sequel and the narrative it told."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I forgot the sequel even came out. It's so un talked about so I'm assuming it's mediocre rather than extremely bad or good. What's funny is I watched the original be played and bought Afterparty expecting a wild ride only to be extremely disappointed. So hearing it didn't do well doesn't surprise me actually? Now I wonder if the sequel had an arg like the first
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Yeah I’m going to go into Catalyst without all the expectations I had originally and just play it for the fun parkour. I think I will like that!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Thankfully.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Having done everything in a single session, I disagree. It was a very long session though."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Same especially as at the time while I wasn't in quite as dangerous a position I was in a job where I was just zoning out to get by because reality was just too boring and I didn't have time outside of work to do more than eat and sleep. 

Needless to say I quit my job shortly after seeing this scene."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"When I played Jedi: Fallen Order, I couldn't help but compare it to The Force Unleashed. It's such a power fantasy game, that playing as Cal felt like a letdown lol. So much so that it's not canon, which makes sense because Starkiller is just so OP."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Yea it’s ass idk how or why it’s taking this long for insomniac to at least add NG+
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,[deleted]
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,No haha. But we did not ever play it again.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"That's what I love about some of those cooperative puzzles. You can finally beat them, then play again 3 months/2 years whatever later and be totally baffled all over again.

I know my brain certainly isn't memorising how to beat each level and retaining that."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Holy hell someone else had problems with this level? Me and my friend had a lot of trouble with this one like 9 years ago now and just quit co-op then and there lol
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Not in the broom closet, I hope."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,this is the best thing I've read in a long time
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,I played both games back to back and Catalyst still had great gameplay.
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,He literally pulls down a star destroyer lol
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-24,You monster!
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,Idk why I fell for that 💀 it would be funny as heck but also incredibly silly
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Oh, did you get the Broom Closet ending?  The Broom Closet ending is my favorite!"
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,"Yup, then he >!1v1s Darth Vader AND Palpatine back to back and wins (depending on the player)!<. The man is broken lol."
19dpm0w,2024-01-23,2024-01-23,...I find that concerning.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Outer Wilds is a game predicated entirely on learning. It can take you twenty hours to beat it. Once you've done it once, you can do it in ten minutes. Barring a major brain injury, there's no replaying it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Probably Return of the Obra Dinn, fantastic puzzle mystery game but once you have the mystery solved that's the main draw of playing the game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Doki Doki Literature Club - There's no need to play the game anymore than the one session you'd need to sit down and play through this game.

There is no way to recapture the sense of creepy uncertainty and absolute surprise that came from playing the first time.

I know there are people who have gotten fun out of replaying it for the card game mechanics....but for me the card game was really just a framing device to tell the story of the game.

The Persona games feel completely different after the first run; if you aren't that fond of the battles you'll be leaving the game after some minutes. The series leans so much on character development and psychology that it's hard to start the development again.

Spec Ops: The Line is just so brutal that the best way to experience it is not playing again. It leaves such an astonishing feeling in you that you'll be better off leaving it there.

Short indie games like Venba or A Short Hike are so story dependant that there's just no replayability. I enjoyed both of them but I won't be returning to them soon.

Visual novels like Ace Attorney are also very hard to replay due to the gameplay being almost non-existant. DDLC is another example that follows the same path as Spec Ops: the first experience is just unforgettable.

Portal is a special case because the main story has a somewhat bad replayability. However, there's so much community content being released nowadays that you can pretty much find new games based on Portal."

The suspense, the mystery, and wonder of you trying to piece it all together has a massive pay off for a reletivly short game. But once you've completed the story it doesn't have any reason for you to come back until its been so long you've forgotten everything about the story.

At the time heavy rain was an amazing game. Good graphics, decent story, subverted games and made a completely playable movie basically. The only issue is that once you play it once, you find out it’s actively lying to you throughout it.

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"This is an older one, but the entire Myst series. The thing that elevated this one over other similar puzzle games was that the plot was relavant and the puzzles were relevant to the plot. It wasn't cheap McGuffins to throw the puzzles in front of you. In fact, they created enough lore that they turned it into a novel series later."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,God Of War 2018. I was addicted to that game. As soon as I platinumed it I never played. Sekiro is a game that's tied with GoW for me but I've played it like 6 times by now.

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Oneshot. It's one of my favorite games of all time but it's hard to play a game that you know what happens. I may replay it because of the achievements though...
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"What Became of Edith Finch

You spend the game exploring your family home, it's a beautiful story that you can play in a day, but once it's over, there's no replaying it. 

Hauntingly beautiful and just so weird, though. Definitely an all time favorite."

Truly amazing physics.  The story is s bit meh but that's not why you're playing.

Great big playground, fantastic characters, gripping story. Just a good time all around.

I never want to touch it again. I can't. I've done everything that I needed or wanted to do. There's nothing else, and the idea of starting over from scratch makes me want to tear my own eyeballs out. After I beat it I loaded it up a few days later to check something. I turned it back off after maybe five minutes. I just couldn't do it."

I love this game with my whole heart, and I finished replaying it like a week ago (being the first time I beat it in 2020). But because it's a puzzle game, unless you have the memory of a goldfish and instantly forget all the answers to the puzzles, then it doesn't really have a lot of replay value in the short run."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I've always wanted to go back to antichamber but having finished it already makes most of the puzzles not that entertaining anymore
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I wouldn’t say one of the “best”, but I had a good time playing Dungeon Encounters. It’s kind of mindless. During the pandemic I probably spent a good 50 hours on that game before I went cross-eyed. However, I’m in no rush to try it again.  

Maybe someday if we move or I have a long flight and I bring my switch.  

For those who haven’t played it, it’s a cute little Square Enix title that’s unlike anything I’ve ever played. It uses the old school turned based attack system from the early FF titles, as you dungeon crawl down 99 floors that look like crossword puzzles. Different squares have different bonuses or enemies, and you gain skills throughout that will allow you to teleport and other things. I enjoyed making my party and getting the hang of it.  

The only thing though is that once you pass the learning curve and get yourself set up, it becomes extremely repetitive, so the only thing you’re doing it trudging to the end. And if you ever have the severe misfortune of falling through a trap door (hidden squares on the crossword floor that) your party is scattered throughout the world, and it takes FOREVER to find them. Ya may as well just start over.   
In true ‘Squaresoft’ fashion, the late-middle and end game reminds me of playing FF8 or FF9 where grinding and exploiting parts of the game for hours is just part of your homework to beat the final boss. Dungeon Encounters by floor 70ish really does just feel like you’re running back and forth outside to grind monsters so you can lv up.  

I would definitely recommend the game to try out, especially if you like single-player games that require a pen and paper. It’s very cerebral and harkens back to games my uncle used to play on MS DOS with bare-bones graphics. The real game is happening in your imagination. Requires you to keep a diary as you’re going so you remember where things are, and write out your goals.  


…. 
Actually, now that I think about it, I wish I had more free time cause I might try busting that out again haha."

Horizon zero dawn. And even though i havent played it yet, forbidden west as well. While i consider it way up there in my favourite games list, ive essentially given up on my ng+ playthrough on ultra hard. The difficulty spike is insane coming from normal difficulty. No health bars, enemies ripping through 2/3 of your health in one hit, enemies being absolute units, and good resources being incredibly hard to find. I cant bring myself to spend more time on a difficulty level that makes me want to blow my brains out. I am so done with it.

And even if you could play it without that better wiimote that the game required, most of the game puzzles are essentially motion control-based puzzles, it's like playing guitar hero with a regular controller.

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Deathloop. I thought it was gonna be like the Hitman games. But unfortunately there’s only one way to kill everyone and complete the game. Leading to no replay value.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"There was an incredibly simple game on Kongregate where you won by not doing anything. There were maybe 10 levels, and you lost if you moved the mouse. 

They had pretty creative ways to try and make you move the mouse, and I think one of them actually got me. I have no idea what the game was called though. Cool idea for a game, but no replay value."

It's actually awesome !"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I really enjoyed playing through Deathloop but I feel like I’d need to forget all about it to enjoy another full play through
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"This will be a weird one to say but the Horizon games. They are spectacular and very fun, but I’m not sure how much replayability is actually there.

Those games are unique to me because although they are open world, it’s still a straight narrative story. If you go through the game doing every side mission before moving on with the main story, there kind of no reason to play it again.

There are collectibles, but as far as missions go, not much is changing. You are going to see the same stuff happening in the world no matter how many times you play it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,All of them. The best games are only great because of your first time experiencing them.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’m going to say Shadow Of The Colossus. One of the greatest, but once you’ve figured out the trick to each colossus the magic wears off. Maybe I’ll forget the mechanics years down the road and play it again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I kind of feel like Ghost of Tsushima fits this description. It’s got a very definitive end, and once you’ve done all of the collectibles and side quests, it’s over. You can roam around looking at gorgeous scenery, and *maybe* encounter a mongol or two, but there’s not much beyond that.

And I personally think that’s a good thing, for that particular game. It felt, for lack of a better word, *complete*, which is something you don’t see often in modern gaming, especially at release. They’ve since added some content, but all of it was add-on, none of it necessary to make the game more whole. And that’s awesome."

I tried a second playthrough on breath of the wild and just couldn't do it. When tears of the kingdom came out I tried to complete everything because I knew I couldn't replay it. Amazing games though"

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"God of War 2018. Even with NG+ it is the same game. Once you go through all the stories there is no real reason to go back. You won’t find some hidden quests or dungeon or anything once it’s over, it’s over"

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Tunic has my vote.

The first was a masterpiece and miles is a great game, but personally I just couldn’t see myself replaying all of them since they’re of very linear nature and I have a preference for games with branching storylines (my favorite game this year is BG3 for that reason). Great games, love them, and unrelated to “oh Sony exclusives are just movies!” since i have a ps and an xbox and have replayed tlou numerous times, console wars are for children, it’s just the simple fact that I just can’t really replay them. Tlou is linear too, there’s just *something* that allows me to get back into tlou, I don’t know what it is, but sadly I haven’t found that with SM. Not a bad thing, love Spider-Man, just… different I guess?"

Then I booted it up for a second playthrough, saw it was the exact same layout so I no longer felt lost, and realized it was far more linear than I had thought. A lot of the pathways I chose not to go down turned out to be dead ends, and boy did that ever suck the magic out of it."

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’ve been playing games for almost 30 years and Outer Wilds is easily one of my favourites. In my opinion it is a game designed for people who are passionate about video gaming as a medium.

It has very few mechanics to distract you from what is the core of almost all video games: empowerment via discovery. After the start of the game, you don’t progress because you got enough points, or were given a new weapon, power up other macguffin. You progress because you learned something, and then applied what you learned.

It’s a game I actually think they should have kids play in school, because the feeling of empowerment you get from learning and applying is something I wished I felt when I was studying, and only have now I’m a little older, and have to seek out learning myself."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I think the puzzles are complicated enough that if you wait a year or two you can replay it. I finished it about a year ago, couldn’t solve a single death from memory now"

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I’ve replayed it just because it’s the only game that looks like that. I love the graphics/sound design. I would love another game like that
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I loveeeee this game so much
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Same! Zero replay value, but a great experience.

I'd argue that games like Firewatch do have replay value since the experience is still there (alternative dialogue choices, admiring the graphics, etc). Return Of The Obra Dinn, on the other hand, has gameplay entirely grounded in problem solving. Once you know all the tricks, there's no gameplay anymore."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I've replayed it a few times. It's really not that bad, relative to some other games like it.

It's really easy to figure out who killed who, the hardest part is figuring out what their names are. And there's really no way you'll remember that, minus a few of the more obvious ones. 

For example, one of the characters is killed as revenge, because, ""You killed my brother."" Okay... who's the brother? It's super easy to figure out who the two brothers are, but which one is which? Which one was killed, and how did he even die? I don't even know what the brother looked like! And I have zero idea who this other guy is! 

It's really easy to guess in this games, too. Your ""deaths"" are only confirmed when you've got 3 correct. So there's always a possibility that you didn't understand why a particular death was right, and you could potentially figure it out on the second playthrough."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That's a pretty long session. I think my full playthrough took around 5 hours? I finished it within a few days but still a bit of a grind to get out all at once.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,TBF you can choose to spend the day with different people to get a new bit of story in the middle and I think on a 2nd play through it's fun to see stuff that points to what happens that you missed before

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,That atmosphere is probably the most phenomenonal one and it does it with a fairly low-res aesthetic too!

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I have conflicted feelings on this game because I can see a lot of excellent qualities put into the making of it but at the same time I watched someone play through it on Youtube and then felt like I got the same experience as if I had sat down and played it myself. It wasn't really a game to me at that point it was a movie, but it was being sold as a game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Unless you're me and play these in a single day. I was able to replay the Ace Attorney series with mostly a goldfish brain because I didn't remember the story since I blazed through it. For some cases I remembered the murderer but couldn't remember how they did it. For other cases I thought I knew the murderer but was completely wrong. Then other cases I had no fucking idea what was going on.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It sucks cuz I really loved Danganronpa 2 and V3, but replaying them just to get some different dialogues with characters I didn't interact with on my first playthrough just feels like.. a waste of time?

It's like rewatching a 100 episode anime where there's nothing but dialogue. I remember the characters, I remember the plot. What newfound enjoyment could I possibly get from it?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The main problem with games like these are that the stories they tell are incredible but they're difficult to play again because the gameplay is predicated on you unraveling a mystery. It's like reading a detective novel a second time, you know all the answers so all you can do is appreciate the structure and foreshadowing. The best way to try and relive them yourself is to...watch a friend or Youtuber go through it themselves.

This also makes them hard to talk about to anybody who HASN'T finished them beginning to end. They have niche communities but bringing new people into them is a big ask, especially with games like AA and Danganronpa that have a LOT of story to get through in a linear fashion.

Ace Attorney, Danganronpa, Zero Escape, and now recently Master Detective Archives are all great adventure games that people should give a try, but they're hard to talk about beyond ""Hey, you should try it"" because then you're giving too much away."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Anything with decent story and mediocre gameplay I'd say. Visual novels are just epitome. You can only really experience the plot twist once. I would add Zero Escape series (especially Virtue's Last Reward) to the list. Lame escape rooms (that hardly even contribute to the world building), but great experience otherwise."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'm actually replaying Ace Attorney now, but like ... fifteen years after I first played it, maybe more. I remember quite a few of the murderers, but not the details, so it's revisiting something very nostalgic for me, because it's about the characters and story for me.

I could see how a Danganronpa would be less satisfying second time around, though, where the mystery is THE key element of the game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Only reason to play them again is for different routes.

But then again, also depends on what kind of visual novel you're playing."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Your last sentence is why many point and click or text control adventures, especially older ones from the '80s and '90s, have little to zero replay value for subsequent playthroughs after you beat them.  Most of the fun associated with them comes from trying to figure out the solution to the puzzles, and that is kind of gone once you know what to do.  Some games might be worth coming back for the humor, such as Sam and Max.  

Sierra figured out this would be a problem back in the day, and some of their old Police Quest and Space Quest games had a points counter for certain actions and tasks you accomplished, say a total of 300.  You could finish a game without hitting 300 points, so if you wanted to get that total, you had to figure out all those non-critical tasks or optional tasks that were not needed to finish the game.  IMO, trying to figure out those little things wasn't enough for me to go through again, but good on them for trying something.  

I've heard more modern Telltale adventures have branching plot lines or different endings, so you could play through a few more times to see what happens."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Danganronpa is so convoluted I could definitely play them again. I don't remember much at all.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"> Most visual novels.

Dont most visual novels have multiple endings and different paths that make you have to replay it over and over? Or maybe its just those dating sim games lol."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,At least there’s that Kaycee’s Mod update thing to let you play a bunch more of the first part of the game.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'm playing it right now and it's my first time to try card games. The exploration and the roguelike mechanic which allows me to try over and over again but with every try something is different and you know better, I love it. I'm still not yet even through with Act 1, but I love it!"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Inscryption is one I'm able to play over and over again, but like you said, it's because of the card game mechanics. I love a good card game. The Pokémon TCG game was super fun for me, and act 2 reminds me a lot of it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I really liked the card game mechanics and still was done with the game after finishing it. It just worked best as an integral part of the story.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It’s rare to say “I was playing this card game, and I had about three serious ‘what the fuck’ moments in the space of ten minutes.”"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Seconded for Alan Wake. I didn't think the combat was all that repetitive, but then again it's been a *while* since I've played it. Story was so good, cannot wait for the new Alan Wake.

If you haven't, check out Control. It's a spiritual successor to Alan Wake (and even has some in game easter eggs connecting them), and it's very good."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Only 1 week until Alan Wake 2 luckily
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I really loved walking around in the woods even when it was scary.  I played the remaster recently and still loved it.  It helped that I forgot most of the story but I would play it again.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Spec ops the line was another game with repetitive meh gameplay, but a pretty good storyline imo"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I love the ending where you need to press the same buttons over and over for 4 hours and I also love how someone else streamed it
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I'm still waiting for the achievement to not play it for 5 years, think I must be close to 3 in at this point, as soon as I get it i'l go and play it for the rest of them"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The familiarity of the combat and the story to every other shooter in the genre was such a good choice. You really do auto pilot until the story starts making your choices clear to you, and then you start to pay more attention to the subtle things....

It's never going to be a masterpiece gameplay wise, but story wise? 100% in my book."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,This is one of the best stories in a game I've played.  It was SOOOOOO good and criminally underrated imo.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Ngl, I've replayed it a few times. Still a great game. The second time is actually cool because you pick up on more of the clues as to what is really going on."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I loved this game, it was such a surprise for me. It just looked like a generic shooter, until I was told to give it a go by a friend of mine. Got in on a Steam sale at some point and played through it. Have no desire to play it again, but glad I did."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That >!white phosphorous!< scene ruined me. There's absolutely no way in hell I could bring myself to sit through the whole thing again. Phenomenal game.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"""You feel like a hero yet?"""
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,This was my first thought... that said I'll probably go back to them in a few years. Such good games.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Same here, they’re like the Schindler’s list of video games, don’t think I can handle all that emotional load again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Just commented this before seeing your comment. So dark and depressing, but fantastic games."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Same, maybe 4 plat"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,have you tried outer wilds?
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Yes. The game is so fun but once you are done you can never play it again. Unless you get dementia I guess.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I played it a few times, fun both times, first time I did, I took my time and experienced everything, LOVED THE MUSIC 10/10

Second time I played it I beat it as fast as I could"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Played this with my daughter and we had an absolute blast but yeah, I could never do it a second time, it just wouldn’t have the charm. I’ve heard there’s a sequel coming though so that might be worth looking into"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Played it once and all I was missing was one collectible from the beginning. Apart from that, I agree it’s a one time thing. For me at least… my kids though, love it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I fucking love Stray, I played it over a few days, days when I had nothing to do and all was calm. Rain and candlelight just following the story of this cat in the amazing world it took place. I wish I could experience it again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I haven’t even finished my first play through, just feels like a too large of a task, like I’m 30h in and still not even half of the map unlocked"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Im actually just now going back in! It's been years so I'm into it again. It's nice to be back in Greece.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'm an Aussie but from Greek heritage. There's a farm in Odyssey that is named the same as our surname. We do not have a common name and I completely lost my mind seeing it in game. Wonderful game, but very hard to replay."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,lol same I loved that game and I keep telling myself to replay it but I don’t think I will…
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I was looking at my hours played and it's over 450. Such a long and wonderful journey. Like my own Odyssey.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I have replayed AC2 and Brotherhood loads of times

Replayed AC3 and Black Flag once or twice 

Will probably replay Syndicate and Unity at some point

Will NEVER replay Odyssey and Origins

Never finished Valhalla the first time"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I‘d replay it if they’d bring a ps5 patch with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I still occasionally pick this up and just raid outposts or do random quests and bounties. That fire mace is havoc incarnate!
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I was just about to comment this until I saw your comment, what an amazing game. Can't decide if I'm not playing it again for repetitiveness or because I might cry"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’ve played through it many times. Once I did a no vehicles build using the seaglide, air tubes and deep bases. You’re right that the ending is spoiled but it’s cool to see what alternative play approaches you can take."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I played it like 3 times. It has at least one extra playthrough in it if you find doing hardcore no death run fun. Really adds to the fear. Never know if this trip in your sub will be your last.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Omg this one. When I first tried subnautica, I was BLOWN away. I sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into it. There was nothing like exploring the caves, and heading back to my base, seeing the base being a light in the pitch black like a beacon of safety was like nothing else. Exploring the dead zone for the first time and seeing those monsters come up on you was another amazing first. 

I tried sub zero. And I might go back. But it just wasent the same(serious no pinging radar? Who tf made the choice to get rid of that). And when I go back to the original, I played it so much that I know every location like the back of my hand and it doesn't have the magic of the first playthrough"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Huh, interesting. I could honestly replay Subnautica again and again. Especially with mods. I experienced real fear in that game when I installed a mod that allows reapers to spawn anywhere.... every time I leave my lifepod I wonder if I'll make it back."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,It took me a good couple years before I could seriously play Subnautica all the way through a second time. I had to forget as much as possible to make it feel mysterious again.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Definitely Subnautica for me. Took me a few tries to finally get to midgame so to speak, but once I did there was no turning back. It was one of the greatest games I have ever played to completion and even though I think about how incredibly rewarding it was to play, I have no desire to play it again after I have beaten it now

Still haven't pulled the trigger on getting the second one, heard kind of a mixed bag."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I respectfully disagree with you. I played it the first time almost a year ago and already back then I had in my mind some things that I knew I would want to try on the next try. New ideas for bases, new things I want to see, etc...

Right now I'm on my second playthrough, what's changed is that I got VR glasses and am playing it through in VR. It is pretty amazing that any fear you feel on the normal version is really amplified by the immersion of the VR, every dark depth and alien sea monster feels like the end of the road, but it's awesome to tackle those."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Journey absolutely has replayability! I think I've played through it a half dozen times by now, and one of the things I love about it is that it's such a beautiful and moving game that you can knock out in an afternoon."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"A work of art, that is. A masterpiece of the early 2010’s indie game landscape"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Try out Sky: Children of the Light. Available on all platforms. Its made by the same company, and very similar, but you can actually customize your lil character and make friends and chat and all that. Its free."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,[deleted]
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I’ve played Journey dozens of times. Love it.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I beat Journey and booted it up to play again immediately lol! The music and visuals were so beautiful that it's definitely worth playing again
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I'm kinda hoping I'm going to eventually forget how to finish the game in the same way that I don't remember a lot of the other stuff in the game. Maybe it will take a few years but I do expect to play it again eventually.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"nah, it takes about 15 :D

earlier you cant reach the parts you need and transport them"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,How is this not #1 or 2?
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'm replaying Persona 4 on my vita that I leave in the bathroom. 

Vita is a great device for this because you can just sleep the device and pick right up from when you left off."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"New Game+ is a thing to consider. Subsequent playthroughs are a mere fraction of the time since you have all your items, money, personal stats, and the ability to buy the persona's you've saved in your codex. I don't think most people know you can save your current persona's stats and build directly into the codex. That way if you ever need to resummon it, you can summon it exactly as it was with the abilities and moves."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’ve beaten the game twice (once on the original P5 and once on Royal) and I don’t think I can go back to it for like a decade. And this is like one of my absolute favorite games

I love this game, but some of the issues (the combat system being a little too easy and the story really just being pretty good for what it is) really stick out to me more than ever. But like I said, this is like tied with Mother 3 for my favorite game"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"This one.

I have actually played the game like 50h and was halfway through and then went to vacation. Forgot about it after and then i thought about starting from scratch... yeah, didn't happen, just couldnt go through all these chats again (even if the story was interesting)."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Maybe in a few years.
I recently replayed P4 for the first time since it first came out.

It was much more meaningful and left me with bitter sweetness after I completed it as a 30 year old vs when I was a teenager. Maybe it's just me remembering and projecting my own high school days :("
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I replayed it when Royal came out, my playtime on that file came out around 130 hours. I don't know if I'll do it again. It's crazy how many options that game gives you but given that I've spent probably 250+ hours on it already I don't think I'd ever in my life get through all of them."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’ve completed P5 once and P5R twice. It has great replayability for me because of all the different personas and challenges you can try. Joker only, physical attacks only, only using personas from 1 arcana etc

Yeah the game is really long, but the story is still incredible even after you know what happens"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Pretty much the only way to see every Confidant's story is by playing the game twice (or more). On NG+, your social stats and a lot of other stuff carry over, making it a lot easier to play through every Confidant"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"After 350 hours, all achievements, and 8 playthroughs, I am finally ready to wait for the DLC before I pick it up again lol"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I feel like it loses a lot of its charm after the first playthrough, because you lose the mystery of ""I wonder what I will find over there""

I did a NG+ for the platinum just rushing everything but I don't think I'll ever play it alone again (with friends in Seamless Coop is another story)"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It's understandable. After I beat the game and started a new one with another character, I just started thinking about how long it took originally to get to the end. Like, yeah I can speed run, and I'm better prepared. But with how static the game world is (though still fun - for sure), I just didn't think a second run was needed. I also don't know if I wanted to be bothered again with Act 3."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Honestly the sense of exploration and wonder does go away after the first playthrough. But trying new builds and doing pvp is still fun.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The real replayability is forcing someone who has never played one to play through it, and trying not to rage and take the controller from them."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I've played through portal 2 multiple times though and its still always a blast for me thanks to the great atmosphere and writing
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,this guy does not speedrun
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"My friend played the crap out of portal, he loved seeing how fast he could clear the levels. I’m pretty sure he held a few speed records at some point."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Once you beat it, you try again and see if you can do it faster"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I've played both Portal games many times, it's the atmosphere and GLADoS that captivates me"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Perpetual Testing Initiative
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Disagree. Portal is so charming and engaging that you can play it many times and it's great every time.

Can add replayability by trying to beat levels faster, with fewer steps, with fewer portals, without dying, without ever entering the blue portal, etc."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Half Life and Portal games, due to the nature of their sandbox, how they feel, interact, etc. feel very replayable, even given that they are linear. It's hard to describe. They're just fun, even on repeat."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I disagree, I've beaten Portal twice in like 10 years, I don't remember the levels at all."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The trick to making it repayable is to go loooong periods of time between playthroughs. 

Portal 2 objectively had more replayability because the puzzles are harder and has a better ""story"""
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I've replayed both Portal games like a dozen times each.

But to be fair, I replay the 1st mostly as a prologue so I can enjoy the story and gameplay of the 2nd.

Nothing will beat that first playthrough, but I just find it fun."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I keep replaying Portal every 3-4 years. I usually forget the puzzle solutions by then, or at least only have a sense of direction on what I should be doing. It's a fun and quick game like that and it's great for nostalgia."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The thing I liked about Portal 1 (over 2) was that each room had multiple solutions, one of the downgrades in portal 2 was that there really was only one solution to each room because of how they designed it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I was really surprised how good Inside was.  It's short but a really enjoyable experience.

You should check out Cacoon if you haven't already.  It's about the same length of game and quite unique."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I played braid at least twice and just the other day was considering another go.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Braid doesn't get enough love
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Little Nightmares are my favourite

You can definitely replay them every Halloween"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'm currently replaying Little Nightmares 2 and it still does well at ratcheting up the tension, so definitely some varying mileage on this one. 

Planning to skip the mannequin bit though. My hands are too stiff and full of Raynaud's to manage that again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I've replayed Inside a few times just because I love the atmosphere so much. Especially when you first head into the city
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Sad because I originally planned a slytherin and Gryffindor playthrough, but there’s essential no different besides robe colors. The common rooms are cool too but no reason to go there. 

Also weird how everyone just disappears at night. Too bad they likely cut the curfew system"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,They nail the magic and mystery but hard flopped on the AC:Valhalla-esque  activity bloat.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Yeah it was fun and I don’t regret buying it or playing it, but I never want to again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I can understand this, but I also loved the game. I could maybe see myself playing it again in a new house a couple years or so down the line when it’s fall/winter, I’m in the HP mood and I’ve forgotten most of it lol. Or whenever that new HBO show comes out. Who knows."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Agreed, until you can play it in VR, then definitely worthwhile for another go"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Hellblade was my first thought. Whole game builds up the end / plot „twist“ and I don’t think it can be archived again. Rushed through half of the game on a second run as I missed one trophy but have it up after some time. Most of the fun comes from revealing the plot
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I'm about to play Hellblade after I saw the trailer for the second part.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I love DotT. I replay it every few years. It brings me so much joy, reminding me of my days as child without a worry in the world. So much of the humor was wasted on me when I was young that I didn't get until playing it as an adult."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Crazy to see this so far down on the list! The game is amazing and the atmosphere of walking around to find new puzzles and discovering how all of them work and tie together is incredible. 
Plus discovering the greater puzzles in the world itself is a feeling I can never experience again for the first time but envy those who can."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I agree. My pick was Telltale The Wolf Among Us.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"This is how I feel about God of War: Ragnarok

I’m a single dad with full custody of a 9 year old boy, it’s just been me and him for years. The game came with my PS5 so I tried it and fuck man nobody told me it was going crush my soul like that. Beat it, deleted it, will never touch it again"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,[deleted]
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I actually re-bought this for PC once I got an amazing graphics card. I've tried like 5 times to start the game again, but it's just too slow for a replay. Still my favorite game ever though."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I've managed two playthroughs, one when it first came out, and then another a year later so I could take it reaaaaalllly slow while completing it 100%. It was nice being able to pace myself knowing what comes around the corner."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I tried a couple of times and just can’t get through it a second time
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Can you not replay it due to the emotion? 

I think the world has huge replayability but getting thru the story and really accruing money/weaponry to fully enjoy that world takes sooo long. I was never able to bring myself to create a second game for this reason"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I did a low honor playthrough then I did a high honor one.

Then on my 3rd playthrough I got to *the part* I couldn't continue the story and restarted it again ."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Yeah definitely didn't want to cry again at the end.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Did you play Heavy Rain or Detroit Become Human? Same studio, same great story telling, but even more choices and therefore replayability"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"There are a few things I would like to try differently about Quantic Dream's Big Three, but I can't endure the thought of going through QTEs and shitty movement mechanics."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I think the Dead Space series and Resident Evil 4 remake are the only horror games I've replayed.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I could play Resident Evil 2 Remake, RE7, and RE8 a hundred times and never get bored.

Something about the formula of those games just scratches an itch in me that nothing else can."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Alien Isolation is replayable bc the xeno stalks you instead of scripted scares
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’m surprised I had to scroll as far as I did to see this.

I agree, horror games only punch once. After that any replaying is just because."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I love to replay Infinite because is so scenographic and detailed, even if I know it’s flawed and overall ruined the saga story, It’s so eyecandy and the shooting is pretty good. In my opinion, the most replayable of the Bioshocks"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Man the number of times I felt my heart sink in that game was just too much. I’m planning on playing it again but maybe in another couple years.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I felt like the gameplay was so good I had to replay it on a higher difficulty, which made for a totally difference experience. 

But I skipped a lot of cutscenes, you’re right too intense"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I was depressed after because of the emotional flood. Will play again sometime but it’s been 2 years 😂
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I had to take a BIG long break after the first time because, yeah, I can only willfully put myself into a depression so often.

But like childbirth, you give yourself enough time to forget how much it hurt and then trick yourself into thinking it won't be so bad this time because you know what to expect.

I've done 3 runs and will probably do another in a year or 2. Love those games."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It’s one of my favourite all time games for the one time I played it. It’s like the Boy in Striped Pajamas. I’ve experienced it, my brain was ridiculously stimulated and my heart can take no more"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I’m actually doing a replay right now and im really enjoying it. It’s been a few years since I last beat so I’ve forgotten a lot of details about the plot. Plus the gameplay is just *chef’s kiss*
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The game is great, I love it. Visuals are great, animations are great, music is superb and of course story is amazing. It hit hard and i loved every minute of this game, but once you finish it and know all the story hooks, twists and feels its not the same. I wanted to replay it recently just for fighting and music but gave up at the main menu because I didn't want to spoil all the great memories by degrading it to mindless hack and slash"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"My first time I ignored most side quests and struggled hard on some of the later areas.  When I replay it, I'll take my time and see what I missed."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'll agree with you on this, I loved the game, particularly once you hit the second map and start building roads it's just a joy every time you get another section completed and can zoom around the map like it's nothing, completely gold star deliveries like a pro.  

I feel no compulsion to go back and rebuild my expansive zipline network over the mountain.  I AM however looking forward to doing it again on a new map with a new situation in the sequel."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Jesus I forgot all about that one. I got it on release and was absolutely glued but yeah the closer you get to an ending the more you realize they're Deus Ex'ing you fucking *constantly.* I was furious.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The first run was really fun, because it seemed like every decision was so important.

On the second run, you figure out that the story runs almost entirely on the same rails from start to finish. I mean, I still collected all the different endings, but most of the game is identical from one playthrough to another."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,3 hours later and I think this is the most common answer I’ve seen scrolling through
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"With Master Mode, the sword trials, AND the Hero's path I found myself enjoying NG+ more than my first run through. With exploration and all, I finished the first run in \~150 hours. LOTS of koroks and exploring. But Master Mode took me maybe 50-60 hours with all the DLC and I had more fun playing around with the environments I recognized more than discovering new areas. Unlocked the full map and beat all divine beasts in both runs."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I guess I see where you’re coming from, but especially Until Dawn and The Quarry have replay-ability as there are so many choices that drastically alter the game that I played through multiple times just to see the different outcomes. Also collectibles that are easy to miss on the first plays."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"FF7R I instantly went back through on NG+ , FFXVI, stopped around 1/3 because I was skipping through so much dialogue. Will go back at some point though because some parts are so good. 

To be honest it's pretty rare I'd NG+ a game these days , especially something over 20 hours long."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I just can't redo those long ass playable cutscenes with qtes. Only thing I was over after 5 minutes.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Ask me in a couple years, I'll probably replay it then."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I honestly loved it for the first couple hours and then it got way too same-y
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I made it through the story and while i'd like to finish it, completing the Pokedex is too boring. Love the gameplay of it though and really want another Legends game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"My wife and I just finished Forever. It was incredible, but sucks there is no random elements at all to replay."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Still have to start it up again after 5 years, just for the achievement"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,You experience everything in the game if you do everything in the game? I would hope so.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Romhacks, nuzlockes, or monotype challenges are a great way to replay Pokémon

One of my favorite Pokémon experiences was playing a Crystal hack over covid using only Ground type. Pretty tough run"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,It's for church sweatie.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Why is it no good on replay? I've been thinking of buying it digital on Switch. Endless Ocean was my favorite game on the wii, I loved the swimming simulation and that you couldn't die so it was all about exploring"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Oh shit, what i wouldn’t give to experience that game again from zero"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I really like the levels tho, I played it twice (once on my ps4 and again when I got a pc) and I plan on doing it a third time."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I replaying some of the missions because it actually fun
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"hard disagree, i played it several times, cause there is so much ways to play.

even went to speedrunning it for a while."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Its like It Takes Two: each level has a great mechanic, then wantonly leaves it in the next level for another great mechanic"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I feel the same as you.  I’m not really into mech games, so when I played TF2 I was constantly surprised by how fun and clever it is.  Don’t have any desire to do it again though…I don’t feel like I missed anything."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,You can certainly replay levels and try out different loadouts against bosses
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Now that you mention it RDR2.  I took my time and had a blast the first playthrough.  Second time around I got over halfway through in very little time then just stopped
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I replayed elden ring co-op. It was super fun, we skipped a lot of side quests and dungeons though

Actually surprisingly quick"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,There's always more builds. Unless you've beat every boss with every archetype you definitely haven't gotten the full available experience.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Ahh yeah, once I beat it I realized you can find the ending of the game within a few minutes if starting it. It was fun the first time though, and a little sad."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Maybe that’s why I couldn’t get into Forbidden West. It felt too familiar and killing those robots didn’t really do it for me anymore. Absolutely loved the first one though
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Those are two weird exceptions.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I would edit this so there are no spoilers.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I completely disagree. You see the game in an entirely new context and catch onto a lot of the foreshadowing that was right in your face. The relationship between Atlas and Jack is compelling knowing just how much he’s actually messing with you.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Shut your damn mouth!

Portal 1 is so short my brother and I used to both start a game at the same time and race to the finish. We got it down to like 40 minutes."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Is that you Todd?
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I mean, it's hard to say there's no replayability when the real ending of the game can only be achieved on NG++, both new NG cycles adding more stuff to the first one."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Uhhh what... The game has many different choices and ways you can do quests... Do you not understand the topic or something?
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I can see not wanting to based off of plot reveals but I played kotor several years ago and the idea of going back doesn’t seem that daunting to me considering the different ways you could play. Though it’s certainly not a game I would have any interest replaying without considerable time between playthroughs.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Brb let me do today's wordle a few more times
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"While I get your point. I think its hard to get people to trust they’ll enjoy any game with zero information. My introduction to the game was reading about its primary game mechanic. Thats what made me excited to play it, and I don’t think that it hurt my enjoyment. You find out pretty quickly anyway. That being said, I’m glad thats ALL that I knew."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I bought that game based on the cover art and not much more, and that’s one of the best gaming decisions I’ve ever made. 

Cool game, wish I could experience that again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Don't think there are any spoilers here, (and I'd like to keep it that way!) But...  
I'm literally 6-10 hours in and it just feels like a confusing mess of faceless names talking on those blue squiggles. Combined with dying/restarting alot. I've absolutely given up on enjoying it, and I know that sounds defeatist, but maybe I'm doing everything ""wrong"", or it's just ""not for me"". I've been warned before not to look things up, but them I'm left not having anything to do but fly somewhere, not understand what I'm looking at, then wiping. Advice?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I thought the game looked great and was excited to play it. Made it maybe 20-30 minutes into the game before I was annoyed with the controls (mostly the jumping) and refunded the game.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It’s been years, but I could still do >!the Final Voyage!< if you asked me to. Suffering from success."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Made it right up to the last bit but couldn't figure out what to do because i'd been playing it in little jumps and starts and couldn't remember two specific things. The notes are there, it should have all been spelled out, but I just missed the connection. Looked it up, thought ""oh, dang"" then never actually finished."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Haven’t heard of that one before - thx!
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Even if you know the puzzle solutions in Portal, you can still go through it and have fun with the gameplay. Outer Wilds is litteraly over in less than ten minutes if you've already beaten it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Wish I was you then, I've finished in 2019 and still remember most of it.

I'm still surprised there is no other company that tried something similar in the style."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,A lot of us did! Particularly for those four or so Chinese dudes..
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,My Steam playtime is listed at 4 hours. I remember sitting down shortly after work and working my way through the game. I was also texting my friends throughout the play session.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I’m curious, I’ll never play this game, what’s the secret ending?  (Spoiler)"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"After the weekend where you choose one of the girls to work with shit hits the fan, took me like 1.5-2 hours to reach that point"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Lmao how can you even determine that a game will take 6 years to make
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"They were bought by Valve, development on In the Valley of Gods has been on hold since 2019. They all worked on Half Life Alyx though."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,[deleted]
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I felt that way too until I thought about it for a few days. There was no better way to end it. It was like the ending of The Sopranos or No Country for Old Men. I hated it, but I kinda *liked* that they made me hate it, if that makes sense."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I think it’s supposed to “suck”. It’s about running from your problems, sooner or later you’ll have to face reality which isn’t as exciting. Atleast that’s what I took from it"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Agreed.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Well, yeah? Playing a narrative driven single-player game won't feel the same if you already watched it lol"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I guess I have watched a couple of let's plays on YouTube after I finished the games so the story is still mostly fresh in my head. Plus it's fun to see other people figuring it out for their first time
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I revisit the series every other year or so, I always remember who does it but I either forget how or I forget how to prove it. Will always be one of my favorite series"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I normally never replay games anyway so I don't think every game has to be replayable
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Just you wait
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Plus acts 2 and 3 are a slight let down given that act 1 is completely masterful.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Is in same universe, alan wake shows up even"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Don’t forget about the DLC that has a direct connection to Wake.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I'm playing through that remaster and I played it when it came out. Overall the encounters are usually so quick and you have so many tools and it's slightly more challenging than I remembered I think it's fine.

Honestly I think the game's biggest fault is when you're mired in the mid game it has a very bad habit of taking you to a place and then nothing happening and very quickly going to the next place and I think that's what does the combat a disservice. Rather than get lots of nice story points punctuated by a good combat instead you get a lot of kind of nothing at those ""breaks"". So you're going right back to the combat so fast I don't think that is inherently it's fault just some poor story pacing."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I bought the ultra deluxe edition when it came out and didn’t play it right away. Now I’m a year into the “don’t play for ten years” achievement and… well, I’m not sure if I should play it"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Agreed, gameplay-wise it's basically like every other third-person military shooter from the PS3/X360 era, but I guess that's kind of the point. It's supposed to feel familiar and comfortable for the player right up until it isn't."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I’m so glad it was never spoiled that it was essentially >! Another retelling of Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now !< going in with no knowledge of where that story was going is essential I think
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It was on sale and I read it only takes a long afternoon to beat.

I went in thinking it will be just a generic, but enjoyable campaign to spend a lazy Sunday.

Lol lmao"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I disagree on your Masterpiece gameplay point. Sure, it's basic standard shooting, but it had to be. Its a masterpiece of gameplay masquerading as a mediocre one. Because if the gameplay was anything other than *exactly* what might be expected, it wouldn't work as well. 

That, in itself, is a masterpiece. Masterpieces don't have to be amazing or unique, they have to be perfect. And it is perfect, for the game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It actually makes it kinda rough to play other military shooters, at least for a while. It does such a good job of playing with that “just following orders” line of thinking where you just hit objective after objective to progress the story without really thinking about what your actions *mean*"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Ah ffs, and i just recently got them on sale."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I remember buying it and playing it when I had covid just exactly 3 years ago and now I don't remember anything if you would ask me. I guess it's like movies though that once you start memories start coming back.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,So annoyed it got taken off PS plus when it did. I was planning on playing through it soon and then it left before I noticed
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Saaame. Also it’s one of those games that when played on hard mode, the enemies don’t become more skilled, they just take forever to kill."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Even without DLCs you'd reach well over 100 hours to finish, and that's practically speed running. Can't remember how many hours I spent on Odyssey but I really wish I could get it all back...

Edit: in a good way though I wish I had the patience to replay it. If you have the time and interest, it's worth it. Especially the DLC"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The AC series sometimes is the only game series that tries to be faithful to the people who actually lived in those places. For ex they don’t just make the character in the game random British dudes with fair skin, bc they likely would be olive skinned with some middle eastern features. Unlike Hollywood where ancient greeks are always british"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Thers a good 30 hours of content in the dlc if you havent played that yet. I had to bail halfway through ch1 od DLC 2. As someone who hates chip damage, loot mountains, and dialogue options, i had finally reached a point all that stuff, on top of some other gameplay issues i had, had worn me down into no longer enjoying the game. But if you loved all that stuff, the dlc is just a tone more of it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,It's a gorgeous one isn't it!
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I tend to like to replay narrative-heavy games like Edith Finch. When I go back and revisit it, I pick up on all the little bits of foreshadowing and symbolism that I may have missed because I didn't know the ending, and Edith Finch is packed with this from the very first instant. The symbols, the narrative, the subtext. How the house itself tells the story, and how Edie is literally the one TELLING the story, how both work together to shape a story. It's such a powerhouse of phenomenal writing, and it's inextricably tied to gaming.

Yeah, for me it's the crying. This one, Endling: Extinction Is Forever, and That Dragon, Cancer are all in a box labelled ""awesome game, NEVER AGAIN."""
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,….that is A LOT of air tubes
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I mean...the ending is not really mind blowing. 

What I think could be spoiled are the areas you can explore and how it just keeps....going.  


I tried to get into the sequel but it just didn't seem nearly as good."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Subzero is like subnautica by Disney
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I don't understand why no-one else has made anything like it.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"What would be better, the first or 2nd to play?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Just finished the second one. It has no soul. You're not alone and afraid.

Half the game is on land. Boring.

And the Ipad is the most obnoxious indian woman accent. And it talks alllllll the time"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"White robe full gold trim master here. Play Journey at least like twice a year since it came out, along with the other thatgamecompany games: Flow and Flower."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Yeah man. I’m team replay. It’s nice to be the helper instead of the follower when you meet someone. Such a perfect game. 

This is also my favorite game to watch other people play. I used to make all my friends play it and I enjoyed watching the wonder of their discovery."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I agree with this statement
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Outer Wilds is harder than most games though. I'll replay Super Metroid every 5 years or so and manage to forget most of that game, but the solution to Outer Wilds' final puzzle is so memorable I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forget it enough for it to stump be again."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I'm not gonna say that it should be a top voted response but I was surprised that I didn't see any top level reply mentioning Tunic. I definitely would have expected it to be mentioned somewhere amongst the many Outer Wilds/Obra Din comments.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Cool idea, just maybe give that vita a lil clean every now and then haha"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Only 350 hours? Rookie numbers
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"My first playthrough was 101 hours, did your beat NG+ playthroughs in 30 hours or something?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Completely agree. It was a really magical experience, but I don’t really have any desire to play it a second time. Honestly, it’s almost too daunting to even consider. The game just has so much to do. 

Am very much looking forward to the DLC, though. I’m assuming spring 2024 release date."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That's where the souls series shines. The problem (in regards to replayability) with Elden ring is it takes SO fucking long to traverse the map. I tried going to NG+7 when the game first came out but back then you had to recollect everything every time you completed a playthrough. All the shop bells and everything. It was a slog. It's a little easier now but still a bit much for me
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"the challenge is real

also happy cake day :)"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Portal 2 is a little different, it has more replay-ability. there's more of a story with some puzzles in between. Game play and puzzles feel more fluid, where playing through all 20 ""tutorial"" chambers in Portal 1 felt like a straight puzzle game until you get past it. But that's part of the experience."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Oh, good. My slow-clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Ah, Inside…the good ol’ meat sack."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I watched Inside walkthrough on youtube and just couldn't stop. Then I played a game and couldn't stop. Then I showed walkthrough to a friend and we couldn't stop and watched all 4 hours in one evening. Inside is just a gem

Edit: when anybody asks me for a perfect game, I just say Inside. It's a genre masterpiece in and out"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Cocoon and Inside were made by the same guy btw. And it’s such a masterpiece, I haven’t been so blown away by a puzzle game since Portal"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I completed Cocoon yesterday and I agree it's a great game! Definitely a unique experience!
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Spoiler alert.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Exactly, I loved the game and chose raven claw but I probably won’t replay it for a few years and apparently they are making a second game so if we are new students again then that’s when I would change."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"What, you don't like finding Hogwarts themed gloves and hats exploring ancient tombs and caves? Or killing the same 3 enemy types everywhere you travel?  Their blood is on Ranrok's hands!"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I tried.

Really enjoyed my first playthrough and because the combat is fun, I sorta wanted to give it another go with a different house.

But I just couldn't. 
I made it about a third of the way through my second time and had to stop, because as interesting as the combat is, it wasn't a good enough reason to push through to the end."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Exactly. Loved my time with it and moved on.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I feel a similar way about it. The films are usually played every year around Christmas time and they'll probably get me in the mood for it and I'll do a new playthrough then.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I mentioned that one, too. Just played it a couple of weeks ago. I thought it was just a fantastic game, but no reason to ever replay it again.

It's interesting that games that are more narrative are less replayable, but I will read a book I love multiple times. Not sure what the difference is in a deep way - obviously the function is different, but why is it such a different brain experience?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It's a game that you will remember.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"We must be better.

*For their sake.*"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Ah, a gentleman of culture."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The first time i played it i was rushing it to get to the end, the thing is, it takes at least 60 hours to get to that ending, i enjoyed very little of the game.

Now I've entered a new mind state, one to take it slow, to enjoy the scenery, to absorb the world and the stuff that happens on it but i did skip the 1st chapter because fuck that and im enjoying it way more than the first time"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I tried at least a couple of times just trying to reach the point where you are somewhat estabilished in the world so I could freely explore, but never got to the point again.

At least John Marston was saved at least three times so far."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"For me, it really comes down to using the left side of the controller again at the end. I don't think I have ever felt such a strong emotional reaction to such a simple choice of game mechanics before."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Actually, Resident Evil 4 was the transition between horror and action horror, because once you go past the village, it's all about surviving and killing them plagas, nothing to be scared of, maaaaybe the scene with the bug below the castle and the iron maiden presentation, but that's it.

Same with Dead Space, once you have progressed enough and you learn that they hate dismemberment as much as a normal person would, you can easily press ahead feeling like a badass, then there's the occasional jumpscare, but besides the usual horror intro, the rest is being proud of learning the enemies' weaknesses."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Yeah, survival horror works well because a lot of the scare factor is the scarce resources as opposed to simply jump scares and the unknown."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I don't think it holds a candle to replaying Bioshock 2 with new builds to be honest. BS2 has so many broken weapons just begging to be used for a run.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Yeah the carbine with headphones on just feels properly heavy somehow. Like a cannon
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Likewise, Grounded difficulty was quite the experience and I loved it"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I played through my first time on regular difficulty and it definitely felt the whole time like it was meant to be a little harder. I hate bullet sponge shooters though, so i think regular enemy health with hard resource availability is the way to go."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The jewelers shop is actually “you don’t remember hitting and killing that old man as this character? Huh, weird :)” like it’s gaslighting the video game lol"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It really does make all the choices feel dramatic! The ability to choose to fail things that have tangible impacts like the finger is good, but you realize there’s 3 other ways to get the info you need so only one person really matters"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Agreed. I was replaying The Quarry this year for achievements and I discovered so many small things and scenes I’d never seen or even heard of before.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It (understandably) can’t recreate the horror, and once you know the story it’s not worth replaying. With that being said, it is definitely worth it to keep playing (not replaying) to build and improve on your bases."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,The time travel level slaps.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,A good argument but soul stream go kamehameha
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I get that, and it’s an awesome point. I guess I got enough out of it personally to look back and make some of those connections, but I also did try and replay it fairly soon after originally finishing it so it may have just been too fresh. I really appreciate your thoughts, so I may have to go back and try again now that’s it’s been a few years!"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I see what you’re saying but that’s kinda what I mean, after NG++ it’s kind of a definitive end"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I don’t understand the topic, please elaborate."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,But you can play wordle every single day.  It's a puzzle game with near infinite possibilities. So it's more replable than other games.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It cracks me up when a stranger on the internet is like “the less you know the better, go play it” without even mentioning like…. the genre. Is it a racing game? An FPS? You don’t have to spoil anything to say “it’s a self-directed exploration/environmental puzzle game with a concrete but at first unclear goal.” People know if they’re the kind of person who like that kind of game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"IMO the right amount of info to give people is to explain that it’s like Myst but in a whole solar system. I’m all for hiding the mechanics and reveals, but if people aren’t properly calibrated for a narrative based mystery story, where you *do* need to read everything and it’s not just meaningless flavor text, things won’t go so well at first."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"If you're talking about what I think you are then I've something to add. I went in blind like everyone recommended and that main mechanic frustrated me so much I almost quit. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Then I looked it up, realized it's a feature and not a mistake on my part, and from there I finished and enjoyed the game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It's definitely fair to point out that the majority of the game is flying through space and they there are janky jumping mechanics (which a settings toggle fixes for most people). And that there is no combat.

Whether or not to mention the time mechanic is a different story. I think the were definitely some people who didn't know about that and ended up not liking the gameplay loop because of it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"What, you can even do >!the coordinates!< from memory?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"You should finish it.  I also played it over a few months so by the end I didn't remember every hint, but I still had so many ""ohhh damn!"" moments.  There's so much to discover and I loved the ending of the base game, it's well worth finishing.

Then there is Echoes of The Eye which will shock you all over again.  Even the very start was an ""oh shit"" moment."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I'd highly reccomend playing it, it's up there with Outer Wilds and Obra Dinn for me. The puzzles get really hard though lol."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Lucas Pope* could seriously make a ton of sequels following the insurance investigator solving more of those incidents and I'd snap them all up.

Edit: got my indie devs mixed up."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,A friend just told me about a game called ‘Chants of Sennaar’ it’s about discovering a new language. He said it was a lot like Obra Dinn.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Check out the Case of the Golden Idol! Similar mechanics.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Does that make us racist?
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I think it's the shoes.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I think you were probably supposed to. You could narrow it down, but that sometimes left you with more than one candidate. I liked to enter two I was certain about and then guess on a third so that all three would be locked in when I stumbled on it. That was a really fun game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,>!You get a note from the club president thanking you for spending time with all of the club members instead of the usual ending where existential dread and horror occur!<
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I’d guess they’re just thinking “yeah this’ll take a long time to make, just set the date to be super far away so that people stop asking us when it’s coming”"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It's actually already been ""in development"" for [5 years](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campo-santos-in-the-valley-of-gods-has-a-probably-meaningless-2029-release-date).

The reality is Campo Santo got bought by Valve and this game is never coming out."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It's better than saying it will be out next year, then delaying for 5 years, or releasing a half finished, broken game, or both. (Sure, they could just say TBD, but if 2029 is their goal, then it's not so bad, imo)"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It’s been in development much, much longer. Per another comment, apparently put on hold as they were purchased by Valve."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Half Life Alyx is probably the best VR game ever made, and you can really see their influence on it. But the hardware requirements of playing it mean only a niche audience will ever experience it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,classic mystery box problem
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I get that, but in my opinion the 'juice wasn't worth the squeeze'

Sopranos, no country for old men, they all had a *lot* going on throughout, peaks and troughs.

Firewatch felt the entire time like it was building up to something, this sense of mystery, like what is going on... oh absolutely nothing. I also found the romance elements between you and the other firewatch lady to be extremely trite and the fact that too fizzled out from nothing into somehow even more nothing left me thinking I'd just wasted ~10 hours of my time.

Game looked really good though I'll give them that. Loved the style"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I was a little disappointed but I was thinking about it for days, then thought, if a games ending still has me thinking about things after a week, maybe it's a pretty damn good ending"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"For ace attorney, just wait until they rerelease it again in 5-10 years and hopefully by then you forgot"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,i think the game got a little canon heavy in acts 2 and esp 3. if you’ve played other dan mullins games they hit the nail on the head but otherwise it probably felt kinda random and overdone.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Yeah I stopped after Act 1.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That's kinda awesome. It would be cool to see more different games within that expanded universe.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I must’ve absolutely missed this. Loved control. Tried quantum break and couldn’t get into it. Might try Alan wake before the second comes out
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,...I'd more suggest Thomas Zane does.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Bro I had no fuckin idea the direction that story took. Absolutely crazy twist and turn. One of a kind experience imo
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Oh
My
God.

You blew my mind with the fact that it's supposed to feel like every shooter back then, mocking or parodying the style. Right until the end do you realize this same game questions your decision-making making you feel dirty and disgusting."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,They're really worth it. Really emotional and so extremely beautifully made. After finishing both I just had to take a little break. Give them a try!
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Sammee I wanted to go get all the music sheets cause they are so chill but I have no money for it so
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Yes, for fucks sake. I don't even think I played on hard, but maybe 30-40 hours in I had leveled so much and the enemies had scaled so much that they were just damage sponges. Made it get tedious real quick. Killed my desire to play Valhalla as well, even though the setting interests me."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Honestly, it hit some feels that only a small handful of games has achieved before"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"With a seaglide, two ultra high capacity oxygen tanks and swim charge fins (meaning you don’t ever need a new battery for the seaglide) you can go a long way very quickly. You can also get the reinforced suit that allows you to go in the lava zone without a vehicle. You just need one or two deep sea bases. You can also carry the materials necessary to build a base with you in case you get stuck. With a bioreactor, fuel is all around you."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Below zero felt way too crammed. Subnautica was so cool since anything could just attack you out of the darkness. In below zero you spend half of the time 10 meters under the sea or crammed into a cave.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,It’s not as good. I think I stilled played through it three times though. There just something about the setting I enjoy. As survival games go it’s my favorite. I also appreciate the humor in the writing.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Definitely the first. Better story, better map I think."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Sun zero is for people who played and liked the first one. If you have played neither DEFINITELY play the first.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,There's soooooo much shit to do you nailed it.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,The cake day is a lie
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Have you played it's ""prequel"" Limbo?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I wish they would have put more focus on a few mini games instead of having 20 that have no connection to the world or real explanation as to their purpose outside of being a roadblock to additional skill points or whatever. I particular didn't like the Merlin trials, after about 15 I just gave up on completing them all because they did nothing but pull me away from actual hogwarty stuff"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Really does seem like all roads lead to Hogsmead...
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Also, so many of the caves are cut and pasted or just mirror images. Gets very repetitive after a while"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It was a different game. Similar to Farcry 5, you start realizing that the villains do make a lot of sense. In Spec Ops, you expect a normal shooting game, then you discover that you are actually killing civilians and US soldiers."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,When the kid asks if he can sleep with his dad one last time that really got me
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Oh yeah I forgot about that. Very cool feature.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,And that's probably why I like replying them over other horror games.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"TLOU is meant for higher difficulties imo. 1 bullet, one piece of equipment and no health packs? Yeah you have to very carefully plan each encounter"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Each day is a unique game. Replay a day and you'll see the problem with your statement. Some games are based on problem-solving, or discovery, or learning something. Replaying them will not hit the same way nor be as enjoyable.  
  
Replaying a single day's wordle is an extreme example of this premise."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Thank you. Lol I went in expecting something epic and found a game that is possibly my least favorite genre. Lmao
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I got The Outer World's and Outer Wilds confused and was wondering why my buddy was taking so long to finish it
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That suggestion is only useful if they are 40.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,This is why I did not enjoy it.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"> if people aren’t properly calibrated for a narrative based mystery story, where you do need to read everything and it’s not just meaningless flavor text, things won’t go so well at first.

Expectations play a HUGE part in how you experience pretty much everything. Even with things you eat or drink, if you're expecting them to taste different than what they are, there's a very good chance that it will disgust you, and games are really no different."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Yes.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"You mean Lucas Pope?

But yeah absolutely

Could even have room for other artifacts down the line other than the Memento Mort"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I want that mechanic in every Batman game.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Definitely play it, I just finished the game and it does hit that same vibe."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Second this, it's an awesome game. I was skeptical that any game could scratch the Obra Dinn itch, but I just finished CoS and I was very impressed."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I played Case of the Golden Idol precisely because it was recommended to me after I asked about games similar to Obra Dinn.

It's a good game and I finished it in shorter time than Obra Dinn, but it didn't feel the same. I recommend both, though."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I think the Chinese topmen are interesting because they involve you looking for minor details to identify them. >!There are a couple sneaky ways to find them, but the main thing is that in one of the Bitter Cold segments you can see all of them in their bunks (labeled by number) with their shoes on. Knowing who had what shoe, you could then place them at their various fates.!< It maybe feels more frustrating than clever but I really liked it when I finally got it."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"You can actually >!check the number tags on each of their hammocks, and use their clothing to match them!<. I'm not saying that's what I did, I 100% guessed, but there is a way"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Same energy as “your table will be ready in 45 minutes” and then when it’s ready in 30 it makes it seem so much better.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,The creators seem to have been assimilated into Valve and gone to work on other things. So the project is kind of dead but hasn't been officially killed.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I also disliked the end when I played it but ended up watching a video on video games with bad endings that mentions firewatch. The game is an analogy for grief and how we deal with it - you watch your wife get early onset dementia, no matter what choice you pick in the intro, she is taken away, and your character is a mess. The whole game is just an escape, your character running away from his depressing reality. The story is reflected in the story of Brian Goodwin and his dad, too. The fire forces you to snap back to reality. 

Honestly it's still an underwhelming ending with the conspiracy being nothing but knowing why it's so unsatisfying makes me appreciate the ending more

[The video about games with unsatisfying endings](https://youtu.be/3KWc6aXgOdE?si=8H7wv9OsllTqkn1T)"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,It's wild cause act 1 lasts like 1 or 2 hours max. The best part of the game is over almost instantly
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"There is also Quantum Break, and (?)Maybe Max Payne"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Games where enemies scale with you are terribly designed in my opinion. Makes character progress absolutely meaningless.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Valhalla is way better in that regard,enemies mostly die In 1-3 hits and they respond way more realistic to hits and damage, it looks more brutal knida like Ghosts of Tsushima"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Bath time will never be the same
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Ah true, totally forgot about carrying extra tanks in your inventory and the swim charge fins are a good idea when traveling lean/little inventory space. Sigh might be time for another playthrough soon."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Thank you!! 

I’ve never been able to articulate why I don’t like below zero as much. 

Too cramped is exactly what it is. 

That and I felt like there was too many predators to not have a way to actually kill them or properly scare them off."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,What if I just wanna play it as a sandbox mode without a story?
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Yeah, it is fine and original, but Inside is above in all aspects. Limbo is good original platformer, Inside is just perfect little game."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It was all filler, after doing one type of Merlin trial they become incredibly boring and repetitive.  If the trials don't increase in difficulty or vary greatly in execution it's just filler designed to artificially inflate gameplay time.  They should have focused on more story elements and wiped out the repetitive tacked on RPG elements completely."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I think I beat Resident evil 4 more than 10 times on the Wii when I was young xD. I just couldnt stop enjoying the game.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Replaying the same day in Wordle is the same thing as replaying the same level in every other game ever. That is willfully ignoring the intent of the question. 

Hollow knight is not very replayable if you never reach dirtmouth. RTS are very repetitive if you only ever play the first mission with 10% of buildings and units.

I am not answering the latest in the thread because this would be drowned, but I saw your comparison to the kid and egg question. If that is all Wordle was, then sure it is repetitive. But the idea is that you tell the lkid a new riddle the next day, aka level 2. Just because you have to wait till the next day doesn't change that. Plus there are infinite wordles out there as well that generate a new word at the press of a button but are still called Wordle."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That doesn't make it not replayable. That makes replaying in a single day pointless.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"On paper, every aspect of the game is something that I generally have no interest in.  Walking simulators, the mechanic behind the core gameplay loop, strict time-sensitive requirements...  The only thing the game had going for it was space, and even that was not quite what I was hoping for when going in. One of the top 5 games I've played."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Might still be worth a shot. The story and puzzle aspects are completely unlike anything else I've played.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Haha you’re not wrong. Generally I’d give an explanation of what Myst is like then too. The point is I would explain Outer Wilds the same way I would explain Myst, just without any specifics (beyond, hey space is cool and you can go anywhere in a whole solar system). I think that not knowing *anything* about the game is a lot to ask of new players."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Hey that’s rude, I’m 35 and I know exactly what Myst is"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I think this is a big part of why fans often tell others to go in completely blind on this one. Hear me out...

If you're one of the people who really loves this game, to the point that you're tearing up at the soundtrack months later and recommending it in every remotely relevant reddit thread, there's probably not a lot that compares to Outer Wild's peculiar combination of mechanical and emotional experiences. As a result, it's *hard* to set expectations appropriately for this game.

A vague description of its mechanics would put it closest to a relatively niche adventure puzzle genre that a lot of people are just going to pass on, while fans of that genre are going to find something that doesn't quite line up with other games they've enjoyed. Its primary ludonarrative conceit sort of just sounds like a gimmick. Its story is, in terms of strict prose narrative, not hard to mistake for a collection of sci-fi tropes, and hard to describe without undermining moments that are intended to get their power from a sense of wonder.

And I think that's sort of the crux of it. In a way, this is a game *about* that sense of wonder. All of the things that make most games great, like tight action mechanics or brain burning puzzles or an epic narrative, are just maybe a little better than fine in this one. But if you have an open mind about it, and the game really clicks for you, it absolutely nails this *other* kind of experience that most games aren't even really trying to achieve.

That's very, very hard to get across, especially in a way that doesn't create some other expectation in the listener, and without sounding like an absolute crazy person, as I'm sure I do to many here. Hence the recommendation from many to treat this like a food you've never had anything like. To have the best shot at experiencing what its fans have experienced, have no expectations, and let it show you its own virtues.

All of that said, I totally understand the hesitation to go into a 20 hour game, let alone *purchase* that game, completely blind. Recommendations are just always going to be a tricky thing for this game's fans to navigate."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"My wife and I played and I refused to guess. I kept swearing that they wouldn't make it so we had to guess and there had to be a clue somewhere.

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Replaying today's wordle tomorrow would also be pointless. So would replaying it in a week.
  
If the fact that wordle makes a new game every day confuses you, then think about a riddle (a word puzzle of sorts). It is pointless to replay a riddle, because you already know the answer.  
  
Now apply this to a puzzle game where you remember the solutions easily. Less fun playing it than it was the first time, no?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I don't think I'd call it a walking simulator. Unless we're going to start calling platformers walking simulators. The platforming and flight is pretty forgiving unless you're going for the achievements, but it will absolutely still kill you."

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,That and the Seatruck. I know I'm alone in this but I thought the Seatruck was a massive improvement over the Cyclops. If I could somehow put the truck into Sub 1 I'd never touch Sub 2 again.

17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"You're looking at each daily puzzle as being a unique game. And the are, within the game itself, but they arent different games. 

Wordle itself is the game.  The puzzles are part of that game. 

So each time you play wordle on a different day, you are in fact replaying the game wordle."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It was more my initial impression of the game given the lack of detail going around than what the game actually is.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,The struck is technically better but the cyclops was the very thing I always want in a game. A giant mobile base!
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I much preferred the cyclops. It was chunkier sure. But that big clunky machine felt like entering a tank and felt safe.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Alright, let's leave aside the fact that I disagree with that entirely, because the specific example is really not necessary for my point and I don't want to get bogged down in arguing about why each new wordle iteration is considered the same ""game"", while each new Mario iteration is considered a different ""game"".

Forget I said wordle and let's take a different example: a simple word game I might give a child:

What has to be broken before you can use it?

The child might think for a while and eventually realise the answer is an egg. They'll be happy with their realisation, and have enjoyed the game. The next day I give them the same riddle. Do you think they'll enjoy it as much?"
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Welcome aboard, captain."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"The very next day,  likely not.  Now come back and ask them a year later or 5 years later. 

You're still stuck in the same thing by defining a small part of the game as the game itself.  

You are defining a single riddle as being the biggest part, when asking riddles is the game, and individual riddles are a small part of it of the overall  ""game""."
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,All systems online.
17cb0r8,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"No, I'm not. The word riddle can refer to two things 

1.) An individual puzzle, which does not repeat or vary. For example, the ""egg"" one I gave above. 

2.) A genre of game. All word puzzles are ""riddles"".

When talking about a specific videogame such as Zelda (for example), this is analogous to the first. The game does not vary or change, it is always the same when repeated. I do not get to call every different version of Zelda, with all their differences, the same ""game"", just because they are all the same genre. Neither can I say that I am playing ""riddle"" whenever I solve any word puzzle.

The extreme example of the riddle is to make a point: Any game which is based on ""non-replicable"" experiences (such as solving a puzzle, or seeing something for the first time) will be a lesser experience when replayed. 

A riddle is 100% based on such an experience, which is why it cannot be replayed.  A game like Zelda is perhaps only 10% based on those things (there's also cinematics, gameplay, etc) so it is still very replayable - but perhaps less than something like ""Call of Duty"", which is based purely on gaming and not on problem-solving at all.

That's what the topic is about. It is not helpful to say ""all games can be replayed"". It's technically true, of course, but the experience will be superior or inferior depending on the game."

20 minutes in...enemies are easy to deal with. Then...motherfucking spiders. I killed them, then Skyrim crashed on me so I decided to play some Uncharted 3.

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-24,"I have only played the demo of this game when it first came out on Xbox months ago and yet I still managed to predict what this would be. ""Let me guess. The spider. I just hope he didn't… oh good. No fire or rage faces good."""

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-24,Jealous. My friend says its like a 2D Amnesia but even more beautiful. I look forward to purchasing it if no one gifts it to me for  Χριστόςmas

nnuia,2011-12-23,2012-01-01,"At first I thought this was a haunted tree or something.

When I counted the number of legs on the giant spider, I noticed that it only had 5 legs (3 were missing). Then it dawned on me.
"
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"I feel by putting horrible spiders, or indeed spider-like creatures in games ruins it for people- the spider in this game for example, the corpser in Gears of War, the Flood in Halo (kinda) and the list goes on, just picking some off to the top of my head there, but really I freakin hate spiders and they ruin games."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Yep. I'd heard a lot of good things about Limbo, and I generally love indie games (seriously, most of my Steam library is indie games).

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,I nope'd my way right out of that part too. I think I'm going to play this game during the day from now on.
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Don't understand the love for this game. One of those things where I just look at all the kudos and go ""Huh?!?!"""
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,I don't like it at all. It's boring.

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"You. Yes, you OP. You are shit, and a pussy at that. Limbo isn't even a fucking scary game. Now, get your head out of your ass and realize the game your playing is one of the shittiest ""platformers"" around."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Really?

I don't understand how people can be scared when you just respawn a few seconds earlier. Same with crap like Dead Space. These games aren't scarey, nor do they require any kind of skill. It is effectively a horrible game, it is basically redoing the last few seconds until you get it right."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Absolutely. I've played if at a friends house, finished it in two sessions and it was great. Yeah, it is short but every puzzle felt new, challenging and had an interesting solution."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,Limbo is a hell of a game.  It seems a little short but some of the puzzles are pretty fun to figure out.
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,Yes! Do it now while it's still $2.50. One of the most creative and best games I've played in a while.
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Yes! I bought it on my 360 right when it came out, it's an amazing platformer, errie, and very original."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Okay, well people have stated all the reasons to get it. Here's my opinion: The game has a very unique atmosphere and each area does have a unique feel, but the game is very short and has little replay. 

Also I found it's method of presenting puzzles to be pretty irksome at times, as parts tended to be trial and error (mind you 1 error was often enough to figure it out).

Overall if you're really interested, I'd say < $5 is worth it. Although honestly, I feel there are a lot of other great indie games around that same price range which I would recommend before LIMBO.

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Yes, get it! It's a fantastic game and a lot of fun."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Please buy it!  I paid 10.00 for it and loved it.  I've bought it for 3 friends @ $2.50, just to spread the love.  And to support the dev's in hopes of a Limbo 2."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Yes, it is. I got it on XBLA a while ago. I find myself replaying it a lot just because it was such a good game. "
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,worth the 2 euros
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"For $2.50? Absolutely without a doubt. It was iffy at $10 (given the length), but for the price of an iPhone app, unquestionably so. The atmosphere, minimalist story, set design; all are without parallel."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"2 minutes to spare? the daily deal on it doesn't end for another 3.5 hours.  They last for 4 hours after the new deals come up, it's still $2.50."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Just for the record: It has just about zero replayability. If you played it once, you're done with it, unless you want to replay it later again because you enjoyed it."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Actually, the daily deals go from 1pm EST to 5pm EST (they're at the bottom from 1-5 under ""Ending soon"")"
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,For $2.50 how could you not buy this game? It's worth that price for sure. I bought it about 3 weeks ago and I loved it. 
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Not that you need any more convincing, but just freakin do it. One of the most immersive games ever and currently costs less than a latte. What u waitin for bro?"
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,If you've played the old PS1 game Heart of Darkness it is a fairly faithful clone of that game without any combat and with a much more minimalistic art style.  I wouldn't say it's as good as Heart of Darkness but it's definitely worth playing.
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-24,It's so worth it. I got it one night and played it until 10 am the next morning. So much fun.
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-24,I missed it :/ 
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"No, it's trite, stupid, and I've quite literally played better games in shitty flash knock-offs. Don't fall for the hype, unless you're one of those shitheads who worries about ""the experience""."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Yeah, debating is cool and all and I'ma let you finish, but Limbo is one of my favorite XBLA games OF ALL TIME!"

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"I thought those slugs were a cheap mechanic. It's a way for the level designers to better control how you move through the space to solve the puzzle. Don't get me wrong, the puzzles were clever and well done, but it was pretty transparent what they were getting at. At that point it became really 'gamey' and less explorey."

Just Grab a piece of paper, scoop em up and let them outside. If you're playing skyrim, murder the ever living hell out of them, and in Limbo... bear traps :D"

What you do is, pull the cart all the way to the right. Go up the ladder, pull the rope all the way down, and then quickly jump down, stand on the cart, and try to jump and grab the rope which is dangling under the gears.

Once it is all the way down again, go and hang on the other rope until you are able to run past them both."

They'd probably moan if the game was twice as long and the puzzles were repeated. Each puzzle is unique and well thought out. I really enjoyed this game, the spider challenges and just after this were the best bits, the game got a little weary and frustrating with the reverse gravity puzzles and I'd have liked a slightly more satisfying ending but I'd have no hesitation in recommending this game to anyone.

I should have done it sooner, but usually it would have already cleared by now, of course now that I want something it is going to take its sweet time :P

Thank you for offering your assistance though!"

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,LIMBO is sooo awesome!  [](/b36) You know a game is good when just looking at it gives you the heebie jeebiez.

For full price, this game isn't worth it. For $2.50, it's an absolute steal."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-24,"Yeah I wouldn't want anything to take away from the first, I guess I'm just eager to see what they're going to put forth next!"
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Yeah, previous sales did work like that, I didn't notice the extra 4 hour overlap until a couple days ago."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,I played a half hour and feel like I've gotten my money's worth. 
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,Just picked it up thanks! This will make a good palate cleaner between Skyrim marathons.
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"I think he means replaying it only because it was good rather than because there's more things to do.  You might replay a game to beat your high score or play the evil route instead of the good one, or you might just replay it because you have nothing better to do and you remember it was fun."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Well some games have multiple difficulty modes or multiple story paths.  Some games are just fun to replay anyway such as a Mario game.  This isn't one of them because it's based on solving puzzles, once you know the solution to the puzzle there's no more fun to be had.

That's a ""problem"" with the whole genre though, so I don't consider it to be a legitimate complaint in this case.  If LIMBO was $60 new then yeah, I'd be complaining but that was never the case."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-24,"easter eggs and achievements do not count as ""replayibility""

But, congrats on having a girlfriend, bro."
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Idiots like you and most of reddit, apparently. Having a ""good atmosphere"" or being a ""cinematic experience"" is all fine and good if the gameplay is actually worth a damn--which is not the case with Limbo. "
nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"What's your definition of gameplay? Granted it was lacking in story, but in gameplay, I think not. "

I can overpower my fear of heights to play a game. Fear of spiders... not so much."

nnuia,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,"Fair enough, you're of course entitled to your opinion. 

But personally, while there was a lot left to be desired (and the trial and error process got annoying at times) I had a lot of fun playing through it. 

And that spider of course was creepy as fuck. I played that game throughout with the lights off and the sound turned way up so it was great atmosphere. "

11gxi0,2012-10-14,2012-10-14,"Thanks! Lots of time with an x-acto knife / razor and careful scraping with a big metal spoon (from both the inside and outside) to make some areas as thin as possible without breaking through.

EDIT: I also worked in the dark and kept a flashlight on inside the pumpkin to get an idea of how much light was shining through the thinner parts. The eyes were done with a small drill bit all the way through.

EDIT 2: [Here's the other one I made](http://i.imgur.com/KFJ40.jpg). I got a little burnt out after the first one so I made something a little less complicated.

EDIT 3: Thanks for all the positive feedback, folks. Means a lot. This got buried somewhere in the comments, but [here's a video of the first one with the flickering lights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzfukgfDILM) and Limbo music for the full effect."

Unfortunately my pumpkin was rotting out when I started carving into it so the whole thing became translucent."
11gxi0,2012-10-14,2012-10-15,"Same way I did [this](http://i.imgur.com/GM3Z5.jpg) hackjob a few years ago (it's supposed to be a gargoyle on a pumpkin, submitted it to the yearly Blizzard contest and only got honourable mention unfortunately).  You use the very outer opaque layer that's only a millimeter thick or so as your completely black spots, and then for areas you want varying shades of light for, you peel that skin off and then dig away at the pumpkin to achieve various thickness's.

That's how I managed to make the wings look more realistic; hell, they are probably the only thing on that carving that was actually visually recognizable."

11gxi0,2012-10-14,2012-10-15,"In my opinion, posts that reference other posts are ridiculous. Instead of posting in the comments for that original post, which makes much more sense logically, it's clear that the OP of the followup just wanted to make sure that more people saw it. Not a big problem, but it means that anytime there is a significant post front pages get flooded with ""I see your..."" posts. Your pumpkin is sick, but to make a new post referencing an existing post as its stepping stone seems tacky.

**tl;dr**: My title comes off a certain way, but that's not why I did it.

Edit: Upon re-reading this, I can see that title format I chose has a built-in implication of superiority that I certainly didn't intend. My mistake.

Yours is awesome,

I don't know what I am going to do this year but the mummy and skeleton are much too unoriginal for my liking.  I just didn't plan ahead so i just plopped out what I thought of.

I'm looking forward to what you are going to do this year."
11gxi0,2012-10-14,2012-10-15,"Heh, thanks.  I spent a while trying to get the wings right.  Doing the little pumpkin's face was hard as hell too, because the holes for the eyes and mouth were so tiny and hard to cut without fucking the rest up :P

I may give 'er a go again this year.  We'll have to see."
11gxi0,2012-10-14,2012-10-15,"Lol, thanks.  It was really my first attempt at doing something cool on a pumpkin.  I had moments of frustration with it to say the least, but after about 7 hours it was done.  Best way to do it though is to for sure draw your design out on the pumpkin first with marker that washes off so you have a guide.

Might try it again this year."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"""Me spent 4 years working on a game...""

Sounds dumb right?  It's because you're using the wrong personal pronoun.

""I spent 4 years working on a game...""

Much better when you use the right personal pronoun.  Then you can add your friends into the mix:

""My friends and I spent 4 years working on a game...""

When you're not the subject of the sentence, use ""me"".  ""This game was made for me.""  ""The list of developers of this game includes me"".

When you are the subject of the sentence, use ""I"".  ""I made a game."", ""I like this game."" etc.

When it's a compound subject, the same rules apply, you just have to break down the compound subject into individual subjects.  ""This is a picture of [my friend and] me"".  ""[My friend and] I took this picture"", etc."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"> virtually every arty indie game is basically about a small child being lost in a scary world, probably because they're frequently made by tech nerds new to the industry, having to face the fact that it might finally be time to get a real job and figure out how to do their own laundry. Which also explains why the games are usually highly unsubtle metaphors for something from the standard list of tech nerd mental health issues: anxiety, depression, isolation, the fact that nice girls don't want to touch them.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Any advice for when your game slows down when too many objects are in the scene?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I probably won’t be able to play but I really admire the entire video game you and your boys built from scrap
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Wow! This looks great!

Also- what's it's name? Is it on Steam?"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Probably not a bad idea to at least tell us the name of your game and, call me crazy, maybe even throw in a link to the Steam page so people can buy it."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks like Inside

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"That looks awesome!

You should get some YouTubers to play it. DanTDM, Bijuu Mike, etc."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks beautiful! How many of you worked on it? Was it full time or a passion project?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Wouldn't happen to have an arachnophobia setting, would it? That eight-legged freak was way too realistic for my liking"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Is it available on xbox?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Massive Little Nightmares vibes going on

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"This reminds a bit of littlebigplanet, I miss playing that"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Yo one of the reviews already has sort of spoilers in it, that sucks"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,The strings are kind of annoying. I would prefer them less visible. Maybe you can add an option for that.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,This gives me unravel mixed with little nightmares vibes! I love the look!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I watched this trailer last night. I pre-ordered it as soon as I was done with the trailer! Can not wait to play it. Pat yourself on the back!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Oh lol already had it wishlisted neat
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Idk shit abt game design but even I can see that you guys put a lot of ambition into this, great job!"

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,The art style looks really cool!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Love this concept.  Great job.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Commenting to remind myself to check it out.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Literally just another basic adventure game except all characters have strings on them
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Oh this gives me strong Limbo and Little Nightmares vibes. But you still managed to make it something different, oh that is fenomenal. It looks super scary and stressful and utterly stunning!

I'd love to play it, what's it called, where can I buy, how much? XD"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Nice work man, looks cool!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks great. Marionettes creep me out.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,"Nice, one of the most successful advertising post disguised as not an advertising post."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,Fucking so tired of seeing these limbo knock offs.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,so amazing
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Love the idea, and from the trailer, it looks like it’s not only a visual thing, but an actual mechanic.   
I might like it more than Limbo and the other one."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I would buy it! Where will you release it? Steam?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,This looks like a game I can get attached to.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"I think the concept, graphics, and dedication looks really cool. I have severe arachnophobia so the spider freaked me out, but ill try and recommend it to friends. Its called Abby right?"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Wow that looks gorgeous! Nice work
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,What is the title and where can you buy it?

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Yeah that spider looks way too good for an arachnophobe. 0/10, will not recommend. 

Lol no jk but seriously OP it looks really good. Smooth, crisp graphics, interesting new mechanic to tickle the brain. Shaping up to be an interesting product."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Are you looking for honest feedback? 





It looks like your average, run-of-the-mill side scroller where the devs added some strings to each character that go off the top of the screen. It doesn't look like anything novel or interesting, or different from the other games that get spammed here all the time."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Is it paid?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Is it free on steam? If not how much
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Can I play it on PS4?

I'm noone's puppet.

FFS no one got the joke?"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Are the strings just for visual appeal or they affect gameplay in any way?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,It looks so cool <3
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Graphics look craaaaazyyy. Nice work. Where is it going to be available?

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"It looks really cool but I don't fit the life of me understand what you didn't bother to tell us the NAME of your game.

Edit: downvote all you want. I'm still not searching blindly for your game."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Is this a straightforward game or is there strings attached?....I'll see myself out

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks gorgeous
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Does the spider shoot webs that can tangle up your strings? That'd be kind of neat.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"It's sad that the best Rock Paper Shotgun can say is ""An Intriguing Puppet Adventure""."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Genuinely loving the art style! But I'm honestly starting to become a bit dubious about some of the claims behind made when devs make posts like this on Reddit...
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Very cool. It reminds me of Inside, but much more beautiful. Will it be available on iPad?"

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Can't fool us this is the death stranding side stroller. Good job kojima
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Waste of time !

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Normally I would be scoffing at the self promotion, but this looks too damn good. Seems similar to Unravel so excited to try it. 

Kudos to you and the team and good luck. You have a purchase out of me."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,It looks absolutely stunning.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"At just a glance this seems deeply philosophical, you have to consider not just yourself, but the strings that move you."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Wow
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Eh looks lame tbh

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Fuck your ad.

But is it available on mobile? If yes then I will definitely download it"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"The artwork is cute, but It looks kinda boring.  I like the vibe though."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Reminds me of Limbo, and I freaking love Limbo"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks like the spiritual successor to QWAP.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,StringLimbo
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,If you port it to switch make sure I can control the character by holding  both joycons in one hand and moving them like a real marionette.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,LIMBO
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Just bought it!! Excited to try it out
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Love the brief clip in the (barn?) where it looks like you block the passage due to the strings, I think that's a really neat mechanic. Think I saw it's called Abby, I'll have to check it out"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"This is astoundingly beautiful, great job!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Been looking forward to this. Reminded me alil of limbo but with the puppet string mechanic. Excited to see how the strings will interact with puzzles. Picking it up on ps5
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,The art in this game looks incredible.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Whats it called????
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,What do the strings add to the game to make it substantially unique from other side scrolls?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Looks good. So do the marionette strings actually play a part in the mechanics? Like do you actually manipulate them to get over obstacles, or do they impede progress in parts due to their length?

My daughter and I really loved the Unravel games, and this sort of looks up her alley."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Do you control movements by pulling on the strings or is that an artistic flare?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,This looks really cool. Like the art style as well. Use Unity?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,It’s like limbo but with colour. Looks great to be honest. Good job done.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Why the giant spider? Why? Why would you do that? /s
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Congrats man! Hope the launch goes well!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Im assuming this is PC only unfortunately:/
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"The lightning would hit the wet string and run down to the boat, like Ben Franklin's kite"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Reminds me a bit of Unravel 2, but looks great."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Unreal / Unity?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,What is the game called
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Please tell me it's called Super Marionette World.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks like any other game but with strings above the character. The overall animation you chose looks nice. Familiar to other games I can’t think of off the top of my head. But oddly original. But do the marionette strings actually work as a marionette puppet to move the character? If so that seems awkward and if not it seems like you could have created the same game without the marionette theme. Basically just taking the strings off the characters. If it mechanically does work like marionette strings it would take playing it to get the feel for the game in order to decide if I like the game play. The Overall look of the game looks great tho animation wise.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Mandatory “To give a Marionette life” theme: https://youtu.be/3eTPTDE7Fr8
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I placed it on my wishlist as soon as I saw the trailer. I love the vibe
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Cant say its the type of game i would play, but holy shit that looks beautiful"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"I'm getting Unravel vibes, which isn't a bad thing because those games are brilliant."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,is it going to be available for ps4? the google doc says ps5 and xbox one but not ps4
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks nice whats the game called?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,What’s it called
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Is the main character named Mary, or Onette?"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I hope it's long enough that jerks don't refund it and tarnish the good work you've put it.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Here, take my free prize and wish you all the succeed  and luck! 

Beautiful art and, as I can see, very cool mechanics as well!

I'm in and indie videogame project with friends too and so far, it was a very hard but nice process. 
(sorry... not native english language)"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Whats this? An indie game advertisement on r/gaming that actually looks good? No way!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"It would be nice if all of the characters actually looked like marionettes instead of simple, cartoonist figures attached to random strings seemingly reaching up into nothingness."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Looks really good, kinda has a Limbo/ Inside feel. The backgrounds are beautiful!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Reminds me of Unravel
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks my graphics can’t handle it
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Hey congrats mate. This looks fantastic
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,What is it called?  Looks dope
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"I'm getting strong Threadless vibes. Looks cool, I hope it does well!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Needs more fatalities !! Jk looks amazing
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I love the colors and animation style! Very cool.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Wishlisted :)
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Looks a lot like Limbo and Inside by the developers “Playside”, which I enjoyed both. Might just have to get this sometime!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Thought it was Death Stranding-related for a moment!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Is it inspired by Little Nightmares? I never got round to playing them…
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,big Limbo/Little Nightmares vibes
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Oh look another tactical advert. 4 years, blood and sweat blah blah"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,It looks like a more in depth “little nightmares” I likeit
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,i wann a play this it looks really cool!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Where is it available?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Unraveled and Limbo combined, basically?

But I'm sure the marionette allows for some interesting game mechanics, if the strings are incorporated into the puzzles mechanically."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Super interested in this. Had to purchase.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"This looks a lot like something Playdead ApS would put out and that's a fantastic thing. I hope the launch goes well for you, it looks like a lot of love and dedication went into this and that's what truly makes a great game."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Ios? Xbox?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I first read the title as “game about *minorities*”.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I think if you actually wanted feedback and not just promotion you would have asked before it was literally about to come out
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I'd play it if it had sound
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Just be ware that if the game is less then 2 hours you are getting srew
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Wow looks awesome! Will it be on Steam?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"I don’t know why but it gives me Kubo vibes. Looks good, not my kinda good but still good"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,It looks like a combination of Unravel and Inside.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks beautiful
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Oh I saw this in the Switch coming soon store.  I am intrigued by it but my husband is hogging the switch playing BOTW. Once he is done I plan on checking it out.  The animation looks wonderful.  Good job and good luck to you and your friends!  I hope that it is a success!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,1 hr but that's.... Now!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I love what I see.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Is there co op? Do the strings get Tangled in any way? This is really beautiful looking and I would definitely play it, congrats to you and your friends on this massive accomplishment!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"While I'm sure there's much more too it, a trailer where the gameplay is basically just ""keep running right"" isn't worth much."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Does anyone know the PEGI rating for this game I cant find it anywhere. I’m definitely going to check this game out just wandering if it is suitable for my kids with out having to do a full playthrough

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"That looks like something I’d like to play. Nice job, this looks very well done."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Looks great. Reminds me of games like Inside, Little Nightmares and Limbo. While I'm not really a fan of those types of games I always appreciate the creativity that goes into them."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I feel uncomfortable just watching
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Looks beautiful, congratulations to you and the team! How many people have worked on this? I may check it out if you promise there are no strings attached (sorry, had to)"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Hi-Jacking to assist the 1,000 'What's it called' questions. The game is called A Juggler's Tale."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,That spider gave me a major Limbo vibe
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Halloween isn’t close enough for this stuff
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,For real I dunno why but I love the look of this. It's gorgeous and so much going on. And wow that spider just looked amazing. I want to get it based on the art alone. I normally don't like these indie games but this looks amazing
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,I noticed that the spider also isn't a marionette...
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,OP is going to need to work on their marketing.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Thanks!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,any chance it's on psn too?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"For anyone interested in if this is all an ad, it is."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Whoa thanks. PlayStation just posted a trailer about it. Will check it out!
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,What’s it called?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,[removed]
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,Looks like a puzzle platformer like little nightmares or limbo

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,Is that essentially what you do in Mario and sonic?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,"So like Little Nightmares, Limbo and INSIDE? This could definitely be a success if they find the right audience."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Got Little Nightmares for free on steam one day, never heard of it before. (My favorite part was shit talking the dumb chef guy because he couldn't bend down to reach under the table, so I wasted a lot of time messing with him with my lighter). I played it, like it so much I bought Little Nightmares 2. Did not disappoint. Keeping an eye on that studio."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I was about to say the same thing. Something about the visuals and the color scheme.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,Looks like Unravel 2

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I got three hits for movies named *Strings*.  I assume you mean this one: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374248/

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I saw the beginning of it years ago but forgot about it until this post. I may just have to look it up again.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"The funniest part is the comment that “finds”  the name of the game always gets tons of awards. 

Blatant advertising."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,The next step is to realize 90% of the front page is boosted
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Using bots to inflate the upvotes to get it to top along with comments that are paid for to make it seem genuine.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,And they have this aesthetic or something very similar.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,*Me and my life-long buddy quit our jobs with billion-dollar pay to pursue our dream of making a video game. After 70 years we finally got our game on XYZ platform!*
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"And the answer is always the same ""shouldn't have quit your day job""."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,and why is it always some indy game and typically nothing else? like 60k people care of some random side scroller.. right
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Looks more like Inside to me than Limbo. Then again, they're both made by the same studio."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"I’d say Unravel more than anything, but still see Limbo/Inside as it’s a side scroller."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Yeah, it looks great, but also looks like Limbo with strings."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Me and AIDS spent AIDS years working on this game. I quit AIDS and gave up my AIDS for adoption just to bring you this side scrolling/metroidvania indie gem. Gimme monies now.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Me and ^STEPSISTER spent ^69 years working on this game. I quit ^MINECRAFT and gave up my ^STEPSISTER for adoption just to bring you this side scrolling ^DATESIM indie gem. Gimme monies now.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,In development for 26 years
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,"Do you know the size of the studio? My friend and I are working on an indie game and we have an LLC and listed as a studio even though it’s just the 2 of us.

The hardest thing about making a game is marketing. To reach a large audience you either have to pay a lot of money, sell out to a publisher, or post on social media. 

This post doesn’t hurt anyone and gives the chance of people to find the game. Of course I may be biased as a developer but it’s annoying seeing people whine about ads. Yeah sometimes ads suck but how else are you suppose to know that whatever product that is being advertised even exists? Ads, as long as they aren’t misleading, aren’t evil. Every product needs them."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"324 awards and 84k points after 6 hours, one of the top comments with several awards is a paid comment saying the name and where to find it. We already know what this is lol"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,"It could be a really fun game akin to Unraveled but they literally don't even show gameplay. They show a person walking... and walking.. and then walking some more. And the first time she encounters an obstacle that makes her strings relevant, they cut away and don't show her getting around it or using her strings in any way...."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,*Yes.*
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,there is always an end user agreement
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Thank Reddit for that. If they tell the name of the game it's labeled as advertisement and it gets removed.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Advertising tactic
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Also there's no actual gameplay shown.  Unless the game is 95% running to the right they need to include clips of what you actually do in the game and how the marrionette mechanic plays into the game.  It could be a good, but it fails to show us it is."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Reddit has come full circle.

>""Please shill at me."""
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"It's called ""A Juggler's Tale""."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,It’s cool how all of them magically and very organically end up as the top post on Reddit within an hour only to not actually sell too well.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"its not that they are the same but there are MANY indie games and as such the majority follows formulas that are either tried and true, easy to program, easy to profit off of, or all of them if they are lucky. 

So enjoy indie sidescroller #4035 with a quirky gimmick!"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I'm wondering if the strings actually do anything or are just visual effects.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,Can I interest you in another Assassin’s Creed?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"_Another_ game in 2D?? when will people try out unique concepts, like a five dimensional game where I find *my whole life is just part of the game* and my purpose here is just the role of an NPC for the actual players to interact with"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Hate to agree but damn its true. Looks identical to a handful of other games. The marionette aspect is the only unique thing i see so far, but it could have more under the surface as far as gameplay goes"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Random,  insane factoid: a three year, intensive research study, with a few hundred test subjects was once carried out to try to prove that u/redheadmomster666 believes children 14 and under are more sexually attractive than adults 18+.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,4 years to make a generic game? Bruh
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Yes because every game has to invent a new genre or mechanic.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Because of the strings! did you see the STRINGS!?!?!?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,I know there’s plenty but I enjoy them lol
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Lol I love going into these obvious adverts and seeing comments like this calling it out. Like go ahead and post your game but it’s annoying that it’s in the form of a disingenuous bought post.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"I mean should he?  If is social media game is good enough to get this upvoted on Reddit, why should he pay for ad space instead?"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Yep, they ask 13 bucks for this.

I can have a good meal for that, a bundle of classic games, or just 1 classic game. Buy a good movie or 3 with that, buy a bunch of cheap second hand games, go to the movies (without the food). Grab a bunch of cheap burgers from mcdonalds. Cook a great meal with that for me and someone. Grab a 24 carton of a soda/ water drink. Buy a pack of underwear with socks. Buy some christmass balls or lights, buy booze for the whole evening...

The possibilities are endless and these guys think this game is worth it compared to those things.

Edit: the game is 2 hours long. The dev said that on the steam forums. Makes it even worse."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"But then it’s just a walking simulator. The strings make it original, obviously."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Looks dumb tbh.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,So they can pretend it’s not an advertisement
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,So their totally-not-an-advertisement ppst doesnt get flagged n removed. Basically r/gaming says you can advertise as long as you dont provide the name yourself.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,The fact that the marionette strings are physics-based and can get caught on objects in the environment is what hooked me.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,This is very much part of the tactic and it works to appear they did not intend to spam as they knew others would link to it. It's great marketing.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Posting links and the name of your game will get you banned from most subreddits. The best you can do is hope that someone else does it for you.

It’s even worse in some of the game development subs.. if you actually talk about your project you’ll get banned. It’s fucking weird."

Top post on Reddit, a bunch of extremely positive comments, was presented as if it was something completely underground and different. It was $5 on Steam so I checked it out and literally it was the most bare bones tycoon game I've ever played. Free mobile games had more to do, better mechanics and were honestly more fun. I gave it a pass cause I figured ""oh it's made by like one guy and maybe it'll get better"" and almost two years later it has had one minor content update and everything about the game is exactly the same.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Yea I only saw this clip but I think it would be really fun to be able to use the strings similar to Spiderman swinging and be able to ground slam off it similar to titan smash in destiny or wrecking ball in overwatch. No idea if this dude went that route but the game looks pretty and depending on price it might be worth it to try it for 10 minutes before shelving it on the rare chance it's worth a larger time investment.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Ooh PS lovely, when is the game getting its release over there?"

Why? Because this post is substantially more entertaining than some reposted meme or gif I've seen intermittently over the last 6 months or longer.

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Usually they buy or use old accounts to do that for them.  Super common strategy.

There are people in the comments asking what the game is called nut when you check their profile, 9 months ago there were advertising this exact same game for others. Reddit's popular subreddits are nothing more than an ad machine at this point"
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Yeah, with free Reddit marketing you kinda just gotta keep it in the rules of subreddits/keep it kinda vague. Either way even exposing people to a trailer and getting some people talking about it is amazing relative to the (non-existent) cost."

Little Nightmares and Inside (as simple and dull as they seem at first glance) are two of my all-time favorite games and they may look like nothing at first glance but they are actually pretty intense strategy games.

My original comment above this (that is currently about a research thing I completely made up) was me pointing out how you could search for the word ""wow"" and look at how old all the accounts are providing praise to this game, supporting the idea that this post is an ad. Redheadmomster then said ""why go through all that effort"", to which I said ""Like every other ad, they want money ?""

Buy tens of thousands of upvotes, thousand of comments. Only reply to the comments they literally *wrote themselves, complimenting their own game*. It's just so blatantly fake, yet they never admit to it.

Also - if you look at the video clips in these posts, it's never of *actual gameplay*. Because they know if they posted the actual gsmeplay it would likely look like shit compared to this."

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,The only time I really don’t like to see people promoting their own work is when it’s on a sub like /r/BeAmazed or /r/nextfuckinglevel this seems totally fine and looks like an awesome game
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,Then in threads where old content that’s “acceptable” is posted people complain that no one develops new content and posts it.   Reddit truly is a wonder to behold.
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"> share their own content.

Add *for profit.  In my travels people love it when users share things they make if they're not asking you to give them something, typically money.

Location/context is also important.  I expect to be advertised to in r/Games, but not in r/gamedev.  It's also why we have r/Ableton, a sub dedicated to the use of software to make music, and r/MadeWithAbleton, a sub dedicated to show off anything you made with effectively no strings attached.  Depends on the sub's culture."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Yea except a lot of the accounts leaving positive comments here are very new.
It's the fact that reddit and/or OP are disguising this ad as a popular organic post, and fooling plenty of people that would otherwise never want anything to do with an ad to interact with it."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Agreed. That guy also had a stake in the ""publisher"" as well. Ads like this post are fine imo, in moderation, but what that guy was doing to r/pics was a bit too much."

A marionette isn't typically considered as an extension of a person's muscles, but as it's own being that is being manipulated unbeknownst to them, under the impression they have free will when in reality someone else is in control. 

When you look at this trailer and see the strings do you think of the muscle movements that are taken to cause a puppet to move in whichever direction?"

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Bingo. If op wants to advertise, pay for it like every other for-profit company and get a nice ""Promoted"" tag next to their post. It's the same exposure, only transparent. Sure, less people will see it, but that's because some people don't like being hawked to when they're here for community conversation."

Aside from paying farms, they're likely just alt accounts or friends of the devs though IMO"

pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-30,Seriously why do people get so strung up on these things?
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"True, but in my experience, if they don't show you gameplay then it's gonna be pretty meh. 

And if you go and watch the Unravel trailer on Steam, it still shows more than this. Here, there are literally 2 (maybe 3 if you count the ""reset"") game mechanics visible. Unravel clearly shows more game mechanics in action, and is much more animated and in motion, despite both being side scrollers. It's a subtle difference, but still important for making the game look much more like an actual game."
pxx79r,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,"Oof, that one's pretty bad. That account was literally made a year ago to comment on the announcement post for this game for the Switch."

I think if you had used some eyebrow wax, gave them a little definition, and defined them a bit while also using a cream or clay eyeliner (I would recommend Tarte Amazonian Clay, personally) I feel like you would get a stronger black which would make it more it more striking.

Make-up art like this seems to be hitting the front page of popular/24 hour tab a lot over there lately.  I guess by 'lately,' I mean that it's been at least a couple of months.  I really started noticing when a couple of my fractal pieces were well-received.

There's usually at least one very popular make-up art on the front page(sometimes 2nd or 3rd page, depending on if it was recently uploaded.  Some of the gals that do it have a lot of +devwatches, it seems).

Also, there's all kinds of wonderful things there, if you've never been.  Personally, I make fractal art, but, if a person can't find something they enjoy there, I think they're just not trying at all! =)

I can tell she used a liquid liner for this, which is incredibly hard to do. On top of that, leaving a blank spot INSIDE a colored spot on a surface like your eyelide (the eye parts of the little boy) is almost impossible. I'm am blown away at how she was able to leave such sharp looking eyes. "

zlba0,2012-09-09,2012-09-09,"I think the poster's line of thought is that you have an oddly high need for social contact, because developing a feeling of loneliness doesn't normally happen in just a day - which is what your phrasing implied. However, different people will have different tolerances for the absence of social contact, and the Reddit demographic will probably be skewed in the other direction from you anyway, meaning they are slightly odd as well (and thus see you as odder than normal).

EDIT: I lazily missed out temporal issues like an absent partner/cancellation of social plans/etc., which also makes being lonely in a day make sense for anyone.

Also (and probably more importantly) I think there's an interaction between you being attractive and saying you are lonely. The only place you normally see titles with ""I was lonely today so..."" is /r/gonewild, AFAIK. So there might be a knee-jerk reaction to see your phrasing as being vain/self-absorbed/attention seeking."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,There's some extreme bangers in the play queue. OP is in for a wild ride.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"What I’m about to share is not bragging. It’s more like a confession.

My game spreadsheet catalogs my collection of roughly 6,000 games. It includes each game’s title (original and “released as”), platform, launcher, original year of release, developer, IGDB’s critical rating, genre, visual perspective, theme, play mode (single player, co-op, etc), my personal achievements (high score, completion, etc) and the date I achieved it.

Making it, I learned a lot about spreadsheets and video games. I think in the end the most important lessons I learned were about myself."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,YEAHHHH OUTER WILDS

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play Kotor 2! (though 1 would be higher on my ratings lol)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Love seeing Outer Wilds with a perfect score, hard agree.

Highly recommend:

-bumping Prey up your play queue. It’s an absolute banger, and if you enjoyed SOMA’s philosophical elements, you’ll dig Prey a lot.

-Putting The Forgotten City on the queue instead of “eventually.” It’s pretty short and sweet and definitely scratched that Outer Wilds itch for me.

-Drop Subnautica Below Zero or put it wayyyy back in the backlog. It was okay but fell way short of the original’s charm."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Anyone else satisfied that Outer Wilds is 3rd place and Outer Worlds is 3rd from the bottom? Just makes the list look nice and symmetrical.

4 in gameplay

7 in story telling/pacing

7 in art direction and world design

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I would for sure add bioshock 2 to the list of games to play. You can get the trilogy remastered somewhat cheap now and that’s my favorite games of all time so I recommend hopping to that. Also I’d play last of us sooner rather then later unless you watched the series. My only addition to your list (which is amazing!) is the borderlands games. Not so much one because it’s a bit dated and hard to get into but those games are a recipe for fun.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,If Titanfall 2 won't make it into Favorites I will be very disappointed...

Fallout 3 should be a priority... the lore of Fallout is soooo good.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I’ve done a similar sheet before. Just a quick heads up:

If you want more “objective” rankings per se, then you should probably divide games into categories and rate each category accordingly. That way, you’ll get a more complete picture of your favorite game.

Your rating inflation is too high. On a 1-10 scale, if you’re using the same scale that game reviewers use, then 7.5ish should be the average."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I do the same but a bit different. Mine is all games in one list and then there's a big pie chart with 4 categories: completed, ongoing, not started and unlimited (games that basically don't have an ending like racing, mmo or fighting games). By every game there is a completed date. It's too late now, but i wish i put a started date too so i know how long it took me to complete some games. The list is almost 400 titles now and my goal is to have every single one on ""completed"" by the end of my life. The reason why i started this list is bcs i replayed some games on and on and got bored with gaming. By having this thing, i played through titles that i knew for years but never touched them. There's just something in that green ""completed"" that makes you want to discover what's next."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Gotta put part 2 alongside the last of us

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I used to keep a spreadsheet similar to this, then I found out about Playnite. You can import your Steam, Xbox, Switch, and PS games or any custom games and categorize them the same way (i.e., completed, score, not yet completed, want to play). Not 100% sure how you would handle the play queue but I guess you could make that a custom field called “Play Queue” and then rank each game (e.g., 10 for Cyberpunk, 9 for Inside, etc.)

It’s nice because it gives you a visual library since it downloads covers and artwork and also allows you to filter and sort easily. One of my favorite features if I don’t know what I want to play is to click “random game” which essentially picks a random game from your library (you can exclude games you’ve beaten or already played).

Send me a message if you have any questions about Playnite. It took me about a day to set up and I totally abandoned my spreadsheet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Agree with most of those scores but Bioshock at 8.4 is highly suspect. You likely didn't play the title when it first released so I'll let it slide ;)

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Fallout 4 rated higher than New Vegas?? HERESY!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It makes me feel so out of touch when I see people with lists of game they've played and it has a ton of different games in it, because I feel like NOTHING gets me excited nowadays.

Last two games I got hyped for were Persona 5 Royal back in October 2022 (and that wasn't even a new game) and Payday 3, which came out recently (but suffers from a lack of update a month after its release).

I envy people who can play very different genres of game and still have fun."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"This is a new one, with only games I mean. 

I often see this but with trophy hunters and completion percentages, difficulty, estimated time, etc. There was a time when one guy on r/trophies posted his spreadsheet and people started popping out of nowhere with their own creations. I swear, every time I opened a thread, it was an ever better one. I’m talking line graphs, charts, and literally the most confusing shit ever lol.

Good list tho. You definitely have some quality stuff on deck."

Great stats though. I keep my to-do list in a similar fashion and basically try to get a disc in used condition once demand has gone down."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Put the Arkham trilogy on that list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Dude, Baldurs gate 3 needs to be at the TOP of your list. Everything about your preferences says it will be top 3 if not #1 for you"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Between baldurs gate and prey you should plan bg3 second and thrid playthrough

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Detroit over Disco Elysium?????!!!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,It's frustrating me that resident evil 4 is higher on your play list than resident evil 2. I know there are other games between them but that just seems wrong to me.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Youve got God of War Ragnarok bur from what I see, you've skipped God of War. 

Cant play the sequel without playing the first. Plus I highly recommend it anyway.

Plus the Spiderman games.

Death Stranding.

Uncharted Series.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Your personal feedback on each is overly appreciated by me!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Courious how would you rate the last of us part 1 and 2
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Glad you appreciate Soma, truly one of the best stories told in a game as well as a super immersive setting, the interaction with the world is great too and increases this believability."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,No Spider-Man?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Definitely don’t skip then 2018 God of War. The story builds off that foundation and I think it’s arguably the better game in a lot of ways
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"If you played sandbox style flash games when you were young, Rimworld might be the perfect game for you."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,can i get a copy for the template?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I'm not seeing Stray on there...
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,There is a really good app of tracking games you played called GG would recommend!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You should try using backloggd. It can help you track how long it took to beat the game. https://www.backloggd.com/u/LatoDeszcz/ that’s my account as an example, I mainly use it to store my wish list and backlog"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Damn! Jedi Survivor being rated higher than Fallen Order is just blasphemy.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Stray, hm?"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I like it.
Personally I upload my ""reviews"" in [backlogged](https://www.backloggd.com/) it's like letterboxd but for games."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"So many good ones coming up, like Titanfall 2, BG3, and, when you get it, BioShock Infinite

Might I recommend Nier Replicant and Automata? My top two favorite games of all time (Automata *then* Replicant). And if you’re potentially interested in turn based games, I would recommend the Persona series.

All in all though, a great list. People often forget that even 7s are still above average and I think that’s why some are even a bit upset with the list."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,You are my favorite kind of person
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Bro, please play breath of the wild!! I got similar tastes and it is my favourite"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I’m slightly out raged by fallout NV being lower than fallout 4
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Highly recommend adding Metroid Prime Remastered (or Primehack on PC/ Steamdeck), Shadow of the Colossus, and Demon's Souls

Edit: also glad to see you're planning on playing the old thief games - absolute classics 👌"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I didn’t expect to see ME Andromeda in there.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Put GTA V story on the list to play
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Nice list for sure. Not sure if you want recommendations but Witcher 3 is probably up your alley.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Real Q.  

What metric do you use to rate your games?

Looking at Andromeda with a 7.1, I played it on release and then after several patches and can see maybe a 6.0 

I barely rate on a 1 to 5 scale.

Same style games ish.  

Metroid Dread.  1/5.  Hated the levels and the 1 shot robot zones. The stupid counter mechanic that doesn't work on said robots. (It's randomly timed, yea..)

Hollow Knight 5/5 atmosphere, maneuverability, and customization.   I'd give it 6/5 just for the extra splat noises. 7/5 if Dung Defender showed up throughout the game and yelled NUMA NUMA NUMA at you."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Hades is going to fuck up top of your chart
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Just a recommendation since you have PlayStation on your list if you do get one, I’d honestly add the entire Metal Gear Solid series to your list of games. The story alone is worth it. 

The legend of Zelda franchise across various games would also be a worthy addition to your spread sheet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I can not get 1 soul to try and play Outer Wilds.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Please play titanfall 2
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play dark souls.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Dude this is a super awesome idea, I’m gonna follow suit."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I have one for my movies, tv, and video games played. 

And more, to be honest."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Dang, no GTA?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,go buy a playstation for ghost of tsuhima . you gonna love it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,No GTA?????
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I also keep a spreadsheet on my gaming. But I’m mostly just keeping track of what games I’ve completed from what system. I’ve gotten into retro gaming in the last couple of years, so it’s fun to watch the list grow. 

I don’t personally like generating numbers to describe how I feel about a game, but I do also keep lists in my Notes app of the games I’ve completed (by system) ranked based on personal preference (rather than ranking on a stricter “critical” review system).

It’s fun to organize."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You and I have similar tastes, id move God of War 2018 up your list to play."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Do you have anything for games you don’t like? Or are you good enough at picking them that it doesn’t happen much?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,i’m gonna do this
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,GO AND PLAY DOOM RIGHT NOW
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Phantom Liberty gonna pop cyberpunk a tier up
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Theif 2 & 3 lol. But seriously some great games are coming up for you. Enjoy!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I do this too, but my list is just what I played, and what I completed, broken into weeks and months. It’s help me to focus and keep track, without hopping around not finishing anything. I also mark the year the game came out, and as I’ve been going through my backlog from the last 5 years, I’ve only played 3 games from 2023, and played about 40 in total so far."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Get Middle earth: Shadow of Mordor // Shadow of War on there. I think that you'll enjoy them both
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Oh nice, glad to know I'm not the only one who does this. Good way to keep things organized and remember what I have available."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,SOMA and Outer Wilds? Immaculate taste
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You have to play ghost of Tsushima. One of the greatest experiences I have ever had. If you love samurai’s you would enjoy it. The combat is near perfect. Only complaint is which there was more beheadings
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"7.5 on papers please

Despite making this whole spreadsheet op clearly doesn't like paperwork"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man if only I understood wtf to do in Outer Wilds
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,some dedication right there son
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I keep a list of games that I’ve completed with their difficulty and my hours to complete. Very helpful for wading through a backlog.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,What I am getting from your spreadsheet is KOTOR2 is next on your list to play.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Damn and mine has almost 900 games on it
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You are missing out on Sekiro shadow die twice.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I think you should play game franchises back to back. I guess though it depends cause sometimes the games are too similar, but thats what I like to do."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"As someone who also keeps a google doc to track, rank and review all the games I finish, I have never felt so seen by a stranger on the internet."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"SOMA was a 9.8!?!?

The story was pretty peak tbf, but the ""gameplay"" was kinda garbo.

Except that one puzzle where they spell out to you how the consciousness copying works if you haven't wrapped your head around it yet"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Would recommend putting in life is strange(1, before the storm, true colors)  in the might play section. Those games aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have great stories and characters that can maybe be relatable to you. I don't see spiderman in there either, they are fun games if you like spiderman. The Batman games are must play, people hate on Batman Arkham origins but I'd recommend you play it and Arkham knight. God of war 2018 is brilliant. I love seeing lists like these of people who play games just to enjoy them and maybe walk away with something if not at the very least a good time."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man people really love Outer Wilds don’t they?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,METAL GEAR SOLID V STILL A MUST PLAY TO THIS DAY
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,i am very saddened to see that the metal gear franchise is no where to be seen not even on the pkaystation list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,For your own sake move baldurs gate up in the q. I haven’t been invested in a game like that since Skyrim came out.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add Tears of the Kingdom and Add spiderman 1 and 2 to the PlayStation list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Do you use Howlongtobeat.com? I feel like it works well for this too. I don't even really bother with inputting the completion times, I just use it to keep track of games I played and the make notes about what I liked."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Cool list! I will definitely be checking out your top 3 at some point. Currently thoroughly enjoying my first time through Hollow Knight --> masterpiece IMO along with Elden Ring. There is such an absurd number of extremely great games now, it's hard to keep track, let alone try to play them all. This is a handy way to keep it organized - might do something similar myself."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I wish they'd release Ghost of Tsushima for PC already. It's a sin not to have played it. Ranks up there with RDR2 for me.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Nice! Only thing I would add to that list would be Ff7 remake.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fallout 4 higher than New Vegas? why??? what did you do wrong?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Wanna watch my kids and wife for a few weeks? I have a backlog larger than your played games list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Based on how you've enjoyed the games in that list, the two Ori games will likely break into your top 20."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is cool, I did something similar until I found out about backloggd. You should look into the website, it does have free statistics, ratings, etc."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It just hurts seeing the last of us in the eventuall category

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Can you elaborate on why Stray is in your top 10? Out of curiosity.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Putting new Vegas that low should be a crime.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Good post, i just finished Forbidden West, you'll love it"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No Dishonored or GTA V? Elden Ring is a favorite, but no Dark Souls?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You rate games very high
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I didn't especially like subnautica below zero. It's a bit dry. (in a non-literal sense)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm glad you ranked SOMA so high.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Cyberpunk may end up top 5 for you if you’ve never played it. Surely is for me now.

That final scene with Simon and Catherine on the launch pad was so brutal. Even knowing that Simon was wrong about the coin toss, a little part of me was still hoping he was going to magically appear on the Ark and not his copy."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Alyx was an amazing gaming experience. I don't think I will get to play anything like it. Good job on the list. I have one similar on Steam.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I was about to suggest adding Prey to your list, but I'm glad to see its in there already (assuming its the 2016 Prey). Prey has by far the best level design I've ever seen in any game. the entire game world makes sense from a story and gameplay standpoint. The space station feels lived in, like an actual place that could exist and be run by people and function. And just like real life, there usually isn't just one way to get to somewhere you want to be, and the game gives you tools to bypass locked areas using a bit of thinking and experimenting. 

There's one section where you go into the lab that runs and repairs the 3d screens around the station, and the devs of the game made a 3D color grid test that 100 percent makes sense. Its like the color bar tests used on real life monitors, just pushed into the 3rd dimension. Its a small detail but to me it showcased the amount of effort put into to making a believable environment."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I don't keep Excel I just use google notes on my phone. It's helpful

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Saw Breath of the Wild in the play eventually list. I highly recommend you play it AND play it blind. Don’t look up stuff. I miss the magic I felt when I played the game blind my first run through
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31, Metal Gear Soild V: The Phantom Pain
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You’ve got some amazing games in your queue, my personal favourite is definitely Titanfall 2, amazing campaign"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Please play Chrono Trigger soon, you won't regret it.  

Also, not on your list but Undertale and Night In The Woods are two of my favorite games from the last 10 years.  Just be sure to go in blind to Undertale!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thats a really solid list, its also nice to see that people are able to use 7/10 in a manner befitting of it, i see too many people whining around when a game they like is a 7, dude, 7 is pretty solid."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You might wanna put both Spiderman games in the PS section, cuz they are absolutely amazing"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"SOMA is really good, just finished recently. I recommend everyone who loves horror genre."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"This is a well-kept list, friend! Just a suggestion-- if you enjoyed *Return of the Obra Dinn* and *What Remains of Edith Finch*, add *Everybody's Gone to the Rapture* to your future pile. Think you'd enjoy it quite a bit."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Man I’d love to experience playing Halo again for the first time
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Is the Outer Wilds really *that* good?

I may have to pick it up finally."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I love that there is nothing below 'good'.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd move up Origins and Chrono Trigger.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Add Ghost Recon Wildlands
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Glad to see Soma on your list.

&#x200B;

Soma is an experience I'll never forget.

Every time it goes on sale on steam for less than five bucks I nab it for a random person on my friends list. Like some sort of Soma Santa."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Put Halo: MCC on the list! 💪
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I gotta say that shit looks beautiful and I wish I can do that for myself and not keep every game I played on a google keep document.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I like that the original Deus Ex is on your list.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I thought andromeda top 10 at least
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Just use the stash app, it has the best UI out of all of the logging apps and you can open your and others profile on a pc"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yours ""play if I get a playstations"" is the same as mine lol. Luckily Ghost of tsushima and Horizon are rumored to come on PC as of 2024! 

And if I may, I would push up Sekiro (my all time favourite) up a queue."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Phantom Liberty is much better than the original BTW

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Judging by the favourites you are going to enjoy God of War. I would also recommend to play it at least some time with the high difficulty as it is making you to use all in game mechanics, which is great"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Woah, there are some real gems in that queue! Pls also add A Plague Tale series and thank me later"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Hey, I do too! I make a menu with a 3X3 grid: Fast Track, Laid Back, and Clear Mind, with the categories of play, Desk, Couch, and Portable. Then I have a list of everything else that'll join that selection."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Should I try Stray again? Played maybe 2 hours and wasn’t gripped at all but a 9.6 is hella high praise
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Should I clear some of my backlog? Nah I'll just procrastinate and make a lovely spreadsheet
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Great list! You're gonna have a lot of fun.

I have a question though, what constitutes that 0.1 0.2 score differences for you? Cause' I just tend to rank games with a rounded number, the decimals feel like more of a helper for me to rank the games rather than actual scores."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I recommend playing days gone! Its a open world zombie survival game.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yeah portal 1 - 34
Stray-10 not cool"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,This chart is epic! Now I know where to keep my list of games instead of having a whole opera island with like 50 cards. Thanks!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'd recommend the devil may cry series (besides the 2nd game) honestly most fun i had and being one of my all time favourites. Would start off with dmc3 since that has the best written story and being chronologically the first game in the series, dmc5 has great combat and a great storyline as well but nowhere near dmc3 lvl of storytelling. Overall still an amazing series and a great experience.

(If not, I'd also recommend the gears of war series)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Soma was such a good game that I feel like wasn't spoken about much. The gameplay was kinda meh but the narrative and perspectives were done so nicely.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Just as a recommendation, I'd check out Obsidian. It's a powerful note taking app that can let you build a database out of things like this. I'll attach a video of someone doing something similar with movies.

Is it a little more complicated? For sure, but you can do a lot with it in addition to your ratings"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'm glad to see Outer Wilds waaaaay up this list
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I keep a list like this but for what I paid for games. I stopped filling it after a while as you really can't put a price on enjoyment
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"broo Phantom Liberty is must play, especially when you considered the base game a 9.7"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"You can move Horizon Forbidden West to the PC list, its coming out on PC somewhere at the start of 2024. It has a steam page already."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'd move Deus Ex: Mankind Divided into that queue, it really is a fantastic game.  Looks like you love world building, environmental storytelling, and smooth gameplay and DXMD has all of that and then some.  I'm still amazed when I walk into the bank level and see the level of decoration and detail they just added for fun"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd honestly recommend Far Cry 4 instead of Far Cry 3. They play pretty much identical except I hated every character in Far Cry 3 lol
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I keep a notion database with tags and stats lol. I find it interesting to see on which platform I pay the most games, the percentage of games I finish, etc..."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"We have VERY similar taste lol, (main difference is I didn't vibe with skyrim but i just cant stand bethesda gameplay)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I just stare at the tittle for a few seconds and think real hard weather it was good or bad from memory
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Judging by your current state of things, I bet Prey will shoot to the top section 😏✨"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I keep the games I enjoyed on an external hard drive in case I want to replay them on day. As for the rest, I just go with the flow. If I'm looking for a new game and there's one I'm interested in at the moment, I'll go with it. I find it much better than to stress over ""Oh that looks good but I already have so many games to play, should I add it ? Should I remove others ?"" and other thoughts of that kind."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I use Backloggd for that xd

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,How have you got elden ring in your favorites and bloodborne and sekiro in your get around to list but not dark souls ?!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Recently started listing down my games played since birth. I'm at 215 now. It's crazy.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play Alien Isolation. Believe me it‘s one of the best horror story games ever created. Especially if you like the Alien universe.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Excellent list. You are doing yourself a disservice by not playing Bioshock Infinite and Dishonored 1&2
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Try Sekiro or Dark Souls.
Thank me later🙏"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I did the same thing. Titles, platforms, gerne, average time to beat the game and a progress report. Its really good at keeping me from buying duplacates"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Suggestions: 
Marvels Spider-Man (OG- Ps4, Remastered- Ps5 and Pc) 
Marvels Spider-Man: Miles Morales (ps4, ps5, and pc) 
Marvels Spider-Man 2 (ps5)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"With how high Cyberpunk is for you before playing 2.0 and Phantom Liberty, you might want to bumb that game up as it was the only game that could make me think if I want to play more Baldurs Gate or this.

Either way great list!"

Both are on PS and PC."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Be prepared to shed a tear during Titanfall 2. Phenomenal campaign
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Play enderal it's a full game (Skyrim mod) and it's better than Skyrim
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Uncharted is on PC as well :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Is there a rubric for how you rate these games, or just spitballing?  
Also, thief, chief, and colossus are spelled wrong."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I just got back into gaming after a hiatus while in school and it's nice to see I'm not alone in experiencing such great games for the first time so late. Of the ones I recognize on both sides of this sheet, we have the same taste in games and the ones you haven't played yet are so good! I am extremely excited for you to experience these. Good luck!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"How is KOTOR ranked with ME:A. What a disgrace. 

I rate your spreadsheet  1.8 for that."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Clearly unpopular opinion, as I haven't seen it mentioned yet by anyone (of course, I could be wrong and it's buried here somewhere), but Days Gone definitely deserves a look. I have over 600 games on steam alone, I finished it twice on playstation, and twice again on PC. My favourites/top liked list is pretty close to yours, lots of great games there! DG is on my top 5 of all time and I'm honestly baffled why it receives so much negativity."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,As someone who love love loved Outer Wilds and then continued that high by playing Return of the Obra Dinn. I very much appreciate seeing both of those on this list.

I’d also highly recommend Shadow of War (wich has a free Demo, at least on Xbox) and Just Cause 3. Two of my favorite games of all time.

And since Doom 2016 is on the list: Doom Eternal."

The pages give insight to the games mechanics as well as secrets and puzzles. It's a remarkably clever game, and the combat is really satisfying to get good at. Discovering all the secrets was the highlight for me, but even if puzzle games aren't really your thing, there is a lot to enjoy."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"My list is way longer, I dont rank them.
I dont like tier lists that much like others.
Every Game and Series has pro and cons so I dont wanna decide between Crashday, Burnout, F12020 or God of War 3, Uncharted 2 or Rise of the Tomb Raider for example, I love them all so I do this.

I just keep of track wich ones I finished, 

how many do I have in collection, 

physicaly and digitaly and on wich platforms,

some I keep track on wich perepherials I have beaten them like with Move, Lightgun, Steering Wheel, Mouse&K, Gamepad VR etc.

and for some the hours and difficulties I have beaten them, or if I perfected the game on Steam, Gamerscore, PS Platin etc.

Its really fun to keep track what you played and motivates me to beat 1-3 Games a Month, instead as I was a Teenager where I bought 10 Games on Steam, stsrted half of them and finished maybe only one game in 3 Month."

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Honestly I find Alien Isolation a lot better to look at than to play. It just feels clunky as all hell.

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,You got to play the 3 watch dogs games they are so good in my opinion
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I'll say that, in my opinion, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is both better and not as good as Human Revolution. Map/setting wise I think I liked HR more, but gameplay wise MK is an improvement. Even let's you properly beat bosses without killing them! Still absolutely worth checking out as it's a direct continuation of HR.

If you like Deus Ex, you'll definitely love Dishonored. Probably one of my top series by far. Just don't forget the dlc/side games, and consider Deathloop if you like Dishonored. Different setting and not for everyone, but it's very Dishonored-like. 

I also recommend Sekiro, but just know that it is a hard game. You can definitely feel it's made by FromSoft, but it's plays nothing like Elden Ring or other Souls games. Still, I highly recommend it if you can stick it out.

Last, if you don't mind a rhythm oriented game, I HIGHLY recommend Hi-Fi Rush. Came out this year and is personally my Game of the Year (though I haven't played Baldur's Gate or finished ToTK, so that skews things a bit). It's also on Game Pass, so if you get into that, you don't need to pay full price!"

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I need to see this sounds incredible
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,That's so cool to me!! I'm such a big fan of spreadsheets for unusual things! I wanna learn more so I can categorize by genre and see what genres are weighted higher than others to get like an algorithm to suggest games 😂
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I was thinking about posting mine spreadsheet, because I came with similar idea and kept it updated since 2020, but I don't really want to steal thunder from OP.

Since I'm mostly playing on PS I keep separate sheets for games released on Sony consoles and separate for other platforms (which is abysmal in details compared to PS one). This is mainly due to PS trophy hunting since I'm very invested in it.

My spreadsheet is organized with the following columns:

* sorting nr
* game title
* game series
* dev
* publisher
* PSN / Disc (is physical release available?)
* Ownership (do I own digital or physical copy of game, or F2P)
* HMIWI? (How much I want it? 5-point scale, separate for standard, VR and classic PS1-PS3 games)
* PS PLUS (was it given in PS PLUS)
* PS PLUS EXTRA (is it available in PS PLUS EXTRA)
* PS PLUS PREMIUM (is it available in PS PLUS PREMIUM)
* Hype lvl (only for unreleased games, 3-point scale, low/mid/max)
* Platform (PS 1/2/3/4/5)
* PS5 optimized/improved (only when the game was released both on PS4 & PS5 or received PS5 version at some point, i.e. games have separate entries and trophy lists)
* PS Console Exclusive (Y/N, self-explanatory)
* Currently Playing/Installed (Y/N)
* Owned (Yes/No/available in subscription)
* 100% (Yes/No/Started)
* Percent (trophy completion percent)
* Plat (platinum/100% full completion/unobtainable)
* Plat Diff (taken from trophy guides published either on psnprofiles, powerpyx, PlayStationTrophies or other sites which aggregate guides)
* Plat Time (as above)
* How Difficult I think it was to 100% game? (my plat diff rating)
* Plat diff rating - my own calculation which involves diff & time taken from published trophy guides as well as average percent of trophies & completion from psnprofiles. Results are between 0.55 - 100, where 0.55 indicates game with 1 diff rating which be completed up to 1h and has 100% completion on psnprofiles. New games that have 0%/0% completion and no trophy guide reach rating of \~100 (I round it to 1% to avoid calculation errors).

This effectively helps me to keep track of what to plat next & what to expect from games. Some games are long & easy, some games are short & difficult as well as all the flavors in between.

Rating is spread by centiles & based on calculated difficulty to acquire plat:

0.55-1.29 (i.e., What Remains of Edith Finch (0.89))  
1.30-1.79 (i.e., Bugsnax (1.62)  
1.80-2.29 (i.e., Ghost of Tsushima (1.94))  
2.30-2.79 (i.e., God of War Ragnarok (2.58))  
2.80-3.29 (i.e., Tomb Raider (2.89))  
3.30-3.89 (i.e., Fallout 4 (3.71))  
3.90-4.79 (i.e., Dark Souls III (4.19))  
4.80-5.99 (i.e., The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt (5.63))  
6.00-7.99 (i.e., Red Dead Redemption 2 (7.75))  
8.00-100 (i.e., Deep Rock Galactic (14.58))

Some examples of platinum difficulty calculations from 2023:

Baldur's Gate III: 6.68  
Resident Evil 4 Remake: 3.31  
Diablo IV: 6.60  
Marvel's Spider-Man 2: 1.80  
Dead Space Remake: 2.51  
Alan Wake 2: 2.26  
Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon: 4.07

&#x200B;

* Average Completion on PSNprofiles (self-explanatory)
* Plat percent on PSNprofiles (self-explanatory)
* score sorting nr
* Rating - Legendary (>90), Mighty (84-89), Strong (75-83), Fair (66-74), Weak (60-65), Awful (50-59), Trash (<50)
* Weighted Score - calculated from OpenCritic score (45), OpenCritic recommended (20), Metaritic Score (35) & my review/score (80, only for games I have at least 1 trophy in).
* OpenCritic Top Critics rating
* OpenCritic Recommended percent.
* MetaCritic rating
* My Review/my rating
* Release Date
* Borrowed (who did i borrowed my physical copy to)

So far, my library has more than 3000 entries of released games on PlayStation systems & I'm tracking 340 games that have been announced.

It also helps me to keep track of what I own, since thanks to it I know that I :

* own 481 PS games (60 physical / 421 digital)
* have access to additonal 675 games through subscriptions"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Lemme see
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Outer Wilds and Cross Code are my two ""off the beaten path"" favorites lately"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I'm playing the DLC right now. The base game is amazing. The DLC is amazing as well.

Landing on the sun station, most frustrating thing ive experienced in a long while until I learned how a trick through trial and error."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I really liked that game but I got stuck like 3 hours in and never went back. I really need to get back to it to finish the story!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,i am still mourning the fact i can never play it again :(
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"How do you know somebody is an Outer Wilds fan? Coz they’ll tell you!

Just kidding I love it, it’s the most creative thing I’ve played for a long time - but it’s difficult to get my mates to play it without giving anything away!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,No fucking way.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"And GoW Ragnarok will follow. Then Spider-Man 2. Eventually FFXVI.

In other words, if you don't usually play Sony exclusives at launch, they'll be on PC eventually."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,This gives me hope that we will see Spider-Man 2 in two years on PC
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Have a blast, by far my favorite game!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Go in blind, but know this.

If you’re stuck somewhere, **go somewhere else**. The game never expects you to brute force anything. There’s an easy way to do everything. All information you need to proceed is given at least three different ways in three different locations."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Godspeed. I wish I could wipe that part of my brain and experience all over again.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Play the DLC if you have not
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Fantastic game. It was difficult for me to complete the game because of thalassophobia but for people without that fear. Blind is 100% the way to go.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,*KotOR* is definitely in my favorites. It can't not be.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,KOTOR is a 10 for me.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I feel that comparing Forgotten City to Outer Wilds just sets it up to be a disappointment. It's a fun mystery, but imo it's nowhere near as satisfying as Outer Wilds"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Which one is the new vegas in space?
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Played it years a go and still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. Banger.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I thought the story was amazing!! That was my first time playing a game in that style though, so the gameplay was a bit of a hurdle for me though, deff not a bad game by any regard tho !!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It holds a special place in my heart. It’s one of very few games that had me dwelling on its story for weeks.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"LOL yeah I do this to kill time, mostly on lunch breaks cuz find ranking stuff fun. My movies and shows ones are even bigger 😳"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Brains like what they like
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's only because this would feel like a job to *you*.

To other people like OP this is fun to do."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Shockingly, some people find it pleasing to keep things and lists organized."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Chrono effing trigger
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"If you like Chrono Trigger, you should check out Sea of Stars. It's a pure love letter to the SNES era RPGs. I'm about halfway through and I love it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Beat every campaign on legendary a couple months ago  for the first time ever in about a month I think I’m ready for a replay lol, of the first three that is. Excellent series"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's totally valid!! I had NV higher for the longest time but recently moved FO4 up when I looked back at how much I enjoyed each game. NV is 100% the better RPG, but I think the action/visuals/the fact I live in Boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. I do wish it had as many clans and groups as NV did though!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,It's in the play eventually section!! I do think Ill love that one but the amount of game there is can be a bit daunting 😂 Full intention on doing a full playthrough though!!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Do you mean "" baulders gate """
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I'm actually surprised this is the first comment questioning the low portal 1 placement 😂
For some reason as a kid, I played portal 2 and skipped 1 but years later I went back to 1 and it just felt underwhelming compared to the scale of 2. Definitely a great game, but unfortunately I ended up mostly comparing it to 2"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"When I was young I played 2 without 1 for some reason, I recently went back to 1 and was underwhelmed comparing it to 2 :( Still an absolute classic and a great game!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Ooo hell yes!! I'll add those to the list, because I have a strong feeling I'm going to love journey!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's a really good shout, I forgot about that one!! Added :)"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Especially since Uncharted is listed
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Then he should check out system shock after that since he loves bioshock also
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I'd recommend black mesa tbh hl1 looks a little rough these days.  hl2 is still decent though.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Its one of those games. A game I wish I could forget so that I could experience it again for the first time.

It starts slow but its very worth it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I do think I'll play those ones eventually!! I kept the Playstation list on the shorter side for the ones the REALLY excite me but the spiderman games do look pretty cool too!! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It looks really good!!! It's in early access so I'm waiting to see if a bunch more content comes out before I start it :)
But the style/detective gameplay has me keeping a close eye on it!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Also, didn't see the Metal Gear Solid series"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Tbh the first time I played, the flight controls and the wonkiness of walking around on Giant's Deep made me quit an hour in. I questioned all the praise it would get on here and eventually gave it another shot before it finally clicked!  
My favorite part of the game is how thought out and intricate the solar system and it's physics really were! I really appreciate how unique each planet is and how it's dynamics worked perfectly with the time loop. I love mysteries so finding out stuff along the way that I literally couldve done at any point with the tools I've had the whole time to solve the final puzzle within 30 minutes. When things finally started clicking and made me feel like a genius, it just made me appreciate how well thought out every single bit of the game and design really was. I had genuine curiosity to find out what happened to the Nomai and figure out the unique physics of each of the planets that I've found so hard to match by another game! And the way music plays into the game, the soundtrack as a whole, and the epicness of score of the final mission was amazing! All leading up to the ending which I felt was super well done, invoking some sort of existential feeling thats hard to explain.  
I cant fault you for hating the gameplay though, since I felt it too when I first played/quit ahahah. Im just so lucky it finally clicked for me, which, if it doesnt happen for you and the physics/story dont connect to you thats okay too!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"The ambience/color scheme in that game was unlike anything I've played and sooo cool!! I really wanted to meet the girl in the end though Ill admit LOL  
The section where you feel like you are being watched is so unforgettable though!

Will def check out the Hellblade game !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"That's totally valid!! I had NV higher for the longest time but recently moved FO4 up when I looked back at how much I enjoyed each game. NV is 100% the better RPG, but I think the action/visuals/the fact I live in Boston put fallout 4 just a bit above for me. I do wish it had as many clans and groups as NV did though!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It definitely is a slow burn! For me a lot of the fun was actually just vibing! Going around and robbing people/enjoying the scenery/hunting/finding a new area/random encounters was such a vibe during the pandemic for me and spending time getting to know the crew and hanging around camp made the big moments/twists in the late game super hard hitting - and the end emotional!!
I do get the criticism I see a lot that it feels like a chore with certain aspects, so I do feel like it gets better if you start to get attached to the characters but can deff take awhile to get there"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The game gets a little bit better until you get to the end of chapter 3, then it gets exponentially better. There's a pretty lengthy compilation of streamers at the beginning of the game talking about how boring it is and then by the end of the game they're, let's just say ""all in."""
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"No, it doesn't."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-11-01,"I'm not a RDR2 fanboy, it get's a little better but not by much, it stays extremely slow and scripted in missions, the World opens up a bit more to do some side activities but they are not rewarding or anything, just flavor."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The story has 6 chapters, and an epilogue. 50% of the story is told in 4.5 chapters, the other 50% only in 1.5 chapters. However, before some people disagree with me, until reaching that point where the story escalates and you go doing mission after mission, there are plenty of things to do in the open world. Rockstar gives the player the freedom of exploring a full and lively open world, compensating for the linearness of the main missions. Game offers amazing views, from big cities to creepy swamps; vast grasslands to challenging mountainous paths; livestock towns to deserts and much more. The prologue, or the first chapter to be more clear, is very slow. The 2nd and 3rd chapters are where you should engage with the open world the most, to hunt, to play games, to interact with npcs, events etc. From the middle of ch. 4 and onward is a downhill for the story, it becomes quite gripping and may even be hard to follow. But it is definitely a game that has a lot to offer, an incredible detailed world and characters that feel ""real""."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"As a Bostonian I just had to!! I've walked down half those streets irl, such a fun experience 🙌"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I was going to say, no Minecraft?!?"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,With how much hype it's getting online in SUPER pumped to be able to give it a move up from the queue 👀
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Story wise those 2 deff have Stray beat, I really don't know what it is about Stray but I was just so engulfed in that world! Visuals aren't everything but I also think that game was one of the most gorgeous ones I've ever played with the neon lights and reflections (I also loved the aesthetic of the greenery/nature combining with the cyberpunk). I also loved exploring the civilization of robot people and learning about them! It just holds a special place in my heart!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I read somewhere that they can be played out of order and everyone keeps hyping up 4 to the point I shot it up a bunch out of excitement LOL but if it's better to play then in order maybe I should contain myself and wait ahahah
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Autism, probably."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Prey and Phantom Liberty are superior.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"I read somewhere that sekiro is harder so part of me is just low-key scared I won't progress LOL, I barely beat elden beast by the skin of my teeth. I do really wanna try it though!!

& A buddy of mine told me Ragnarok hits better if you play them back to back so I'm half waiting to see when it's coming to PC and half waiting to see if I'll get a PlayStation. But I fully expect God of war gamea to be 9s or 10s 🙏"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"It's actually in my top 10!! ;)
My goodness that game is fantastic. I listen to the soundtrack to chill STILL"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Ahaha yeah that one turned some heads 😂 When I was young I skipped 1 and played 2 for some odd reason, and when I played 1 recently I felt underwhelmed comparing it to 2 :( Definitely a classic and deserving of all the praise it gets!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Yeah for sure!! I'll DM you a copy when I get home from work! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Outer worlds was deff not the most fun for me, just pretty visuals 😂
I will say KOTOR is deff a good game I can see why people love, but I had the twist spoiled for me and am not huge on the combat system so it didn't go super high, but I think if the twist was a full surprise it would've been up a few slots on my personal enjoyment scale! Great characters for sure though"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,LOL tbf the bigger one isn't in order just the shorter queue!! I feel like I would be in more of a rush to play it if I hadn't already watched the entire game on YouTube 😂 But I do fully plan on playing it myself some day!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Both incredible games!! But ranked on enjoyment, I had to give Skyrim the edge partially due to nostalgia and being my first RPG! I remember watching it on YouTube as a kid and finally buying it with my own money. Such a special place in my heart!!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Grim Fandango is a masterpiece, it's a must play"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,[deleted]
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,For the longest time I had New Vegas higher but recently thought back to each game and how much fun I had & moved fallout 4 up. I really liked how New Vegas had a ton more groups to interact with but I think I just personally enjoyed fallout 4 more due to the combat/vibe/and exploration more. Part of it is also that I live in Boston and it was kinda crazy how accurate some of the areas were 😂 so it was cool exploring and fighting on streets I've been on before. I also loved the story and i filtrating the institute
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,I have a fiance 😂😂 I know when we get married next year I won't be gaming much so trying to get through my catalog ahahaba
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's why I keep pushing it back, Im worried characters will feel bland afterwards LOL"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Luckily I actually haven't played a game id consider bad yet !! 
I rank based on soo many things but mainly: how much fun am I having? (Does it feel like a chore to do certain parts?) How much am I connecting to this game/how engulfed into this world am I? (Am I craving exploring and finding more? How much do I wanna go home and play this game?) And stuff like soundtrack/gameplay/graphics/atmosphere/story/ending factor in too !"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,My memory is kinda bad so sometimes I just like reading back what games I've played and it helps me remember my favorite ones!! Like I look at certain titles and just reminisce what parts I adored. Mostly a time killer during lunch breaks though :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Those ones are ones im considering moving up to the queue once I get through the current ones! :)
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Thank you my friend!!
I've actually not had a game I didn't like so far luckily!! If I had one below a 7 id probably just drop it though 😂 I mostly avoid games I know I wouldn't like too"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Ahaha I'm sorry!! The combat wasn't my favorite and the twist got spoiled for me so it took a bit of a hit for my enjoyment scale :( Still incredible characters that deserved a slot in the Great section !
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,I just throw every receipt into a box.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You’re in a for an experience with BG3. Only game that’s hit mass effect’s level for me, and then it went and did it better."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,You'll love Titanfall 2's campaign. It's relatively short but is still one of the greatest FPS campaigns I've played.
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Bro left us hanging just like that
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"A lot of it comes from the itch.io racial justice bundle, a few years of Epic giveaways, retro games from various compilations and packs, a few different subscriptions, and all of the games I’ve accumulated physically or digitally over the years.

The spreadsheet has been great for the bundles and compilations, which is where I tend to get lost. That itch.io bundle alone is full of hidden gems."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Impressive!
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Glad to see another Crosscode enjoyer. Hella unknown game
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"I like that the game doesn’t hold your hand for doing that. It feels so good when you finally get it just right. It’s great. Man, Outer Wilds is great"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You really do man, and just know its not everyones cup of tea, dont force yourself to enjoy it"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Complete edition $60
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"It's not *that* big of a surprise, the last one came to PC eventually too. Nice to see where almost there for the sequel tho"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,Some people may have already died waiting Bloodborne to coming PC lol. The game released in 2015 when I'm in high school and now I'm employed
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,It’d be great if they’d hurry up and bring Ghosts to pc
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,My favorite DLC ever. The sequel I always wanted to the game

17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"You're correct, even story wise I prefer Stray too. Just an awesome game from start to finish"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,Really depends on the person. I found sekiro to be easier than elden ring. It is faster but parry focused and more aggressive. The lack of equipment and stat leveling means you don’t have to worry about having a bad build but you also won’t be able to overlevel to beat a hard boss. Imo it’s more satisfying that way so i prefer sekiro’s combat but both are great games.

The graphics in that game are one of the compliments I can give it tho, the world's had some super pretty colors!"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"That's fair enough! Did you play it years after it came out? When it was first released it was absolutely amazing, the graphics haven't held up well over time."

The sheer level of quality and tedious detail put into every last square inch of that game is unrivaled by any game I've ever played or even heard of. I would say you should bump it up in your queue, but it'll make every other game feel ""meh"" after you play it."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"it’s only similar to ME in that dialogue can have consequences. Everything else is different so not sure why that comparison was made but it’s still a good game, at least the first act is"
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Given the effort you’ve obviously put into this spreadsheet, I suspect you might come to hate BG3 - you’ll have to introduce a new category for games that score 11/10."
17k0111,2023-10-30,2023-10-31,"Yeah understandable, the puzzles do feel like too much sometimes. It's satisfying to complete them but it can get frustrating. I really enjoyed the conclusion so would recommend you to finish it but do note that you will want to do the dlc as well since that's essentially the final conclusion and it might not feel complete without it."

No, he imagined, and showed us what the game would look like with a Limbo feel, which was a fucking awesome game.

yww0u,2012-08-27,2012-08-28,you obviously did not play limbo...
yww0u,2012-08-27,2012-08-28,"It doesn't have to be the same exact game in monotone, the gameplay could be changed to fit the style. It would be challenging to have Lakitus able to spring sneak attacks on you from clouds, and I'm sure Nintendo would come up with all sorts of other kooky shit to throw in there, like how they didn't make Mario Galaxy exactly like SMB3 in space. New environment, new game, and it did well.

Besides, we all *know* what everything in a Mario game looks like, I'm sure most of us would be able to accurately fill in a Mario World coloring book from memory by now. As it stands, all the Mario platformers look the same by now, with their sleek, pixelless, next-gen models that look like they just came out of a 3D printer. Just less aliasing and better shading with every new system that comes out.

Change is good. Let's have a grittier Mario. Maybe even a *really* gritty M-rated Mario, where he takes some bad mushrooms and wakes up in an alley somewhere, except now everything looks like Grand Theft Auto V, but with hallucinations of nasty, realistically-textured Koopa Troopas and Goombas creeping out from behind every object, and the first thing Mario does is grab an SMG with Fire Flower, Inc engraved on the side from a trash can and say ""Let'sa go"" before the opening credits roll to a heavy metal intro.

Yeah I know that'd never happen, but I'd play the shit out of that."
yww0u,2012-08-27,2012-08-28,Maybe it would add an ending.
yww0u,2012-08-27,2012-08-28,"Obviously a mario game would not be done entirely in this style. It would be interesting to see this done for certain levels, such as underground warp tube levels. Or to design a game that had you switching back and forth between light/dark with a power Mario has (for example, a bowser-corrupted dimension and normal Mushroom Kingdom, just a day/night cycle, or as part of a Luigi's Mansion game; spirit world/real world).

It would be pretty cool to have dark colorless levels like this to contrast the bright colors in the rest of the game. It would also do a good job conveying a more sinister tone if used appropriately with the plot."
yww0u,2012-08-27,2012-08-28,"That, and whenever you even touch an enemy you would die/explode in a gruesome display of blacked out gore and guts.

yww0u,2012-08-27,2012-08-28,"you'd have to make it deeper than that. add new mechanics to the game. perhaps expand on the whole ""falling behind the foreground"" technique they had in MB3 similar to how rotation was added in paper mario. 

make it darker. make enemies more aggressive and puzzle-esque. kill off peach and have it send mario into a vengeful rampage (terms of enrampagement kind of rampage) while making him a jaded aged hero in the midst of it all.

you could add a lot of depth and fun to it. it would be a bastardized version yes, but I think things existing in an alternate universe like this allows for super creative fun shit to go down."

You know what you also had in the old days? Barely a few hours long games. No support for it after release. Many shitty games that was way harder to learn about befor purchase. Stuff like that that people like to forget.

Don't get me wrong, I loved gaming 20+ years ago but I still do today.  Just stop prerordering, wait for sales, wait for patches, wait for complete editions if you want."

Edit: they deleted their comment but someone alluded that was just Sega but man same with Nintendo games. You can do most old Mario games and Metroid in a day or two if you know what your doing. 

Old games made up for limited space by making themselves “harder” so you’d get more play out of them, cause they did not have large amounts of actual content."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"So many shitty games back in that era. Inflated, bullshit difficulty so you'd have to keep feeding quarters/renting the game out. Box art that had literally nothing to do with gameplay. Games also had a fraction of the content they often do these days, so a ""whole game"" back then probably wouldn't pass as a half a game these days.

And the best part is without the internet it was damn near impossible to tell the good games from the shitty ones until you had already paid for them."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Back then a complete game was very light on content - and to compensate that it was really difficult and often times you had to figure very basic stuff out because it was overly complicated. 

And today? Most games are complete! Sure there is dlc,  it most of it is completely unnecessary. And sure there are patches and some games are not in the best state when released - but then again games get supported for a very long time.

Every game can be expanded upon, tweaked, improved, bug-fixed, etc. Your cognitive dissonance comes form the fact that video game developers COULDN'T easily do these things once a game shipped, especially before the internet came around.

And speaking of bugs.... Every. Single. Console. Game. Ever. has bugs.

All of them. Don't believe me? google ""<insert favorite game> known bugs""

So, isn't it nice that we live in a day and age where developers can continually improve the games we play? Well, that's a question for a different debate because there are pro's and con's to this as well... namely things like microtransactions, NFTS and pay-to-win.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"First, this is stupid because it's cherry picked of the best games of that time. Tons of games were glitchy messes. 

People also seem to forget how short games were. No wonder they were complete. It's why old gamers loved blockbuster or other rental programs. Almost every game was beatable within the 2 or 3 days for the rental even for a kid. Just look at speed runners being able to beat these games in under 15 minutes consistently. 

And we didn't save money. Games were more expensive then they are now. 

I care about how much it costs to entertain me. Today it's the best bang for your buck. Games are cheaper before you include competing retailers and physical vs digital to bring price down. Plus games are generally longer for single player games and multiplayer adds hours and hours of repeat gameplay."

* If there were any bugs in the release, you were stuck with them while newer versions were made and sold. 
* Many sequels and ""special/collector editions"" of games were just what would be DLC today; many of them would just be free updates. Super Mario Bros: the Lost Levels (SMB2 in Japan) would surely have been handled as DLC today, as would the third version of any Pokémon game (except, maybe, Yellow).
* If you wanted the definitive edition of the game, you had to wait until the end of its lifecycle to get it, sell your original to buy the new one, or buy both.

That being said, though, there are a ton of shitty practices today like locking away content that is already included in the base game or making the game unnecessarily grindy in order to ""encourage"" people to pay for Exp boosts."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Now this is some grade A rose-tinted glasses nonsense.

Back in the day, video games were routinely published with missing content that could make them impossible to complete, content was cut from them to reduce the size of the game which would make areas of the game sparse with content or completely empty, and there were tons of bugs that simply would never be fixed because there was no way to distribute patches.

Here's an insane horror story from the mid-90s: There was a demo for a video game where they fucked up the uninstall process, so that if you wanted to uninstall the demo, it would literally delete the entire folder that the game folder was in. The default install path for video games back then was C:/Program Files. Yup.

I thankfully made a separate Games folder, but it obviously deleted all the games I had installed. I could just reinstall those, even though I lost the save games, but some people lost important documents, software that they couldn't easily get back, and many had to reinstall Windows to fix all the issues this created."

Cut content? I'mma be real with you, when you were a kid who didn't keep up with game development and it was harder to do because the internet wasn't what it is today you just didn't notice it. Almost any popular game from any period of time suffered from cut content. 

There were a better sortment of quality games? Bullshit,  you remember the good games, not the bad ones which there were plenty of back in the day.

Add-ons didn't start with DLC, and they won't end with micro-transactions and ""games-as-a-service"" models. But at the same time, I'm not gonna try to yuck someone's yum.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I mean yeah but those games also never got patches and provided you with a couple hours of content before they got repetitive. Personally I'll take a game that continually comes out with updates over a game that's left to rot after it's released.

These cringe memes always leave out the part where modern video games are 20x more complex and expensive to make. And gamers demand the best graphics, perfect polish, and timely release or the studio will be meme'd and shamed.

Considering they have to do CRUNCH TIME as it is (and you still buy the game anyways), apparently they are still not working hard enough.

I'm not excusing completely broken and buggy unplayable games. We have examples of those. But to expect some complex open world games that are 100x more complex than Sonic the Hedgehog, that require 100-200 people to make (at least) and not 12-20 like the old days, to provide everything free for you is absurd.

Like, I hate the monetization fetish that a lot of developers have nowadays too, but games are much more expensive to make now, yet their cost is still around the same. Plenty of games nowadays are a much higher value than anything from the 80's and 90's even before additional content."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"This is such a flawed argument for so many reasons. Mainly you just got the game, no possible way of expansion. Absolutely Skyrim, Mass Effect, or Fallout could come out and not have any DLCs and it would absolutely feel complete, removing the option to expand into that world further is not the same as not ""complete"". Absolutely there are games that put key parts of it behind DLC, but nothing stops it from being a whole game. Are you telling me that if Super Mario Bros 3 had additional content that you could buy that had more levels that wouldn't be a good thing?

Also, you are forgetting how incredibly basic games were back then, so when you open a game to a large 3d world you offer more room for additional content to fill that world. It amazes me that these games that were 128 kb back then felt so ""complete"" when really they were pretty bare."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Think about the length of games back then versus now. Most *full priced* games could be completed in a casual weekend, if not an afternoon. If a developer tried to release a full priced game nowadays that could be finished in under 8 hours, they would be absolutely crucified. 

Also, while it's a problem that developers release buggy, unfinished games and use paying customers as unwitting beta testers, I think it's a worthwhile trade-off for the ability to fix broken games post release"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"And all the bugs/glitches/softlocks that came with them. So, yes, we've given up whole games at launch, for quite a few games, but we have the ability to have games be fixed and perfected, or have even more content added beyond the original.

For games that do it well: Blasphemous, Risk of Rain 2, HADES, Dead Cells, ENDER LILIES, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth/Afterbirth+/Repentance, Rogue Legacy 2, Teardown, and Powerwash Simulator. (Yes, it's all Indies, but that's because indies are on my brain)"

Was thinking ""Finally, a company that is selling their game for under $60"" because not all games are worth a $60 price tag. Bought it and got home only to find out it was HALF of the game. The other half is already on the disc itself but you had to pay another $30 to unlock the rest.

I've lost a bit of interest in games these past few years. Games released that are buggy as hell, season passes, tons of small DLC packages, loot boxes and micro transactions, can p2w right off the bat, etc. It's just become too much to keep up with. I can skip a lot of DLC and junk but so many AAA titles are released and broken. Now I just wait for them to come out with bundled editions at a cheaper price.

Let's not also forget how games like FF7 remake will be released in multiple parts at $60 a piece. Gonna cost like $300 just to play the whole game. I get it's a huge undertaking but dang."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah, but you could beat those games in maybe two hours of play or less.

There wasn't much to those ""complete games"" compared to what you get today in general, and generally speaking you actually do get a ""complete game"" unless you're buying early access or something even today.

A lot of games that ""updated"" to add content just released an entirely new edition you had to buy, you couldn't get the new stuff ala carte like you can now in general.

The idea of an ""incomplete game"" in regard to being ""a partial game"" is mostly a myth.

Sure, update patches for games pushed out before they are done are a thing these days, but you're not buying ""the rest of a game"" in those cases.

You don't buy patches that ""finish"" a game, they are free. The fact that games are released ""unfinished"" is mostly a completely separate thing from DLC/Expansions.

DLC that isn't microtransactions is generally what we used to call expansions, and it worked pretty much exactly the same way, except you had to buy a physical copy and install it rather than it being a download.

We also didn't generally get more in those expansions than we do in the average DLC today.

Yeah, you had those great Diablo 2 DLCs with lots of content, but you've also got stuff like Witcher 3's Blood and Wine or Hearts of Stone, or Borderlands Assault on Dragon Keep.

There were just as many cheap garbage level pack disks that didn't add much to a game back then as there are cheap DLCs with mediocre content today.

You just weren't aware of it if you were playing on a console for the most part.

The only real difference is the delivery method. You just download it instead of getting a physical copy. The actual quality and volume of content has always varied from game to game.

Being ""incomplete"" is not the norm even for games with microtransactions.

Most microtransactions are either cosmetic or ""time savers"" that let you bypass parts of a game. I'm not condoning the practice, just stating what it generally actually is.

The biggest exception to all this would be sports games where you have to RNG for players in a store, which is also bad, but not really representative of most games these days.

The sentiment of OP's image is actually mostly based on myth, games were not more feature complete back then. They were smaller, had less content in general, and large amounts of unlocks were generally even rarer back then as they are now, and almost definitely fewer in number when they were there.

You do generally get a whole game when you buy one these days. 99% of the time, expansions are content that would not have been included in an initial release even if the mode of delivery was the same as back then.

DLC just gave consoles the ability to do expansion content like PC has been doing since the 80s. It pretty much works exactly the same way it always has.

If anything it's less egregious that you don't have to buy a new edition of SF because Super Turbo Championship Edition released. Though, they'll still gladly sell you multiple editions of Pokemon if you want to ""Catch 'em All"".

Seriously, nothing has really changed for the most part except that you're more likely to be able to get something ala carte rather than buying a completely new edition, and it's generally not a physical thing you have to buy anymore.

It's mostly just rose colored glasses seeing a bullshit idyllic past that never really existed.

Unless you're an EA Sports fan, because it ain't in the game anymore, but they're mostly an outlier these days and don't really represent the model of most games with digital content."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"To be honest, an ""unfinished"" game now is still way bigger than a ful game then. Look at zelda breath of the wild. There is DLC. But its 100+ hours without all content already"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,You know a lot of old games are all kind rougelike because when we died. We had to start that mother fucker from the beginning.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Shit this is something that went the way of the dodo. I remember going to GameStop and buying a copy of GTA San Andreas back in the early 2000s and It was complete. I go to GameStop today and I buy a copy of literally anything and there's so much missing from the game that I have to pay for it's not even funny.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I'm not even *that* upset about DLC that adds story content. Expansion packs were a thing back in the day. I wish they wouldn't salami-slice the content the way they do (y'all remember when expansion packs were practically a full game unto themselves?), but at least it makes it easier grab the good stuff and ignore the bad.

But selling cosmetics, graphical overhauls, extra fucking skill trees, and *save slots* is bullshit."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,This is basically the reason why I’ve moved almost entirely to single player rpgs like divinity and prey. It may not be as fun to play by myself but at least then I know it’ll have enough content for a single person to enjoy
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The only reason you got the 'whole game' back then is because they couldn't attach the stuff they cut out into the same game, so they just made a new game and sold you that instead. They chopped a whole bunch out of Sonic 2 and put it in sonic 3, because they wanted to pop sonic 2 out in under a year to hit the 1992 holiday season, and then sonic 3 was split in half again to make Sonic 3 and Knuckles.

So they made three technically 'full' games , released across 3 years. Is that really better than if they'd have finished that content and added it as an expansion to the previous game?"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,games were much shorter back then
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"People think old games were so great but most of them were beatable in like 3 or 4 hours max and had little replayability. 

Not to mention lack of patches meant if a bug was in a game it was there forever."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Also, when we bought a rushed game that could have been fixed with couple of updates, we got a game that was going to be broken forever.

*Edit:* With all this nostalgia going on, we tend to forget that back in the days we had no way of learning about games' problems until we spent our hard earned money on them. There's plenty of games from 80s, that would have probably either been fixed or at least rebalanced with updates if those were a thing."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"In the old days you would pay $60 for a game, then never get new content, upgrades, patches, bug fixes, different music, online play, or anything else for years, then hope a sequel would come out. Repeat. 

Sorry but romanticizing the days of game cartridges and NTSC TVs is stupid."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Honestly this is such a surface level issue. 

Not only did you get ""the whole game"" back then but you also got risks taken which resulted in really unique experiences and franchises which are today, classics, and have usually not failed except when they were turned into multiplayer bullshit or games as a service."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I mean...kinda? Our whole thing growing up was the shareware system. You get a disc/floppy with like...1-3 levels, and usually paid a couple dollar to the guy who.copied it for ya.

Then you dropped the game price on the rest, got it in the mail...and frequently realized the best parts were the free stuff cause that's what hooked you in, and the rest of the games kinda meh.

Late 90's was the era of expansion packs...where you bought the other half of a game they didn't have time to.finish, or the part of a game they outsourced to make a quick buck.

Modernized moneymaking just stings more cause you realized you spent 200$ extra for some skins and shit pumped out in a week or so but sold over a year"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Yes time goes on and things change.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Dude shut the fuck up please. unfinished games have always been a thing so maybe do some research before dropping money on a game
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"So stupid. Some gamers are so blind and entitled.. Super Mario Bros takes about 2 hours top to finish from start to finish, its a very simple game.. Your ""unfinished"" game takes about 50 hours without DLC and is extremely complex. Both cost the same price.  (Mario was 25.99$ in 1985, with inflation makes it to 70$ today)."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,But have you considered that I beat old games in less than 5 hours without knowing anything about speedrun while modern games can last me days and weeks and even longer with DLCs?
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,"I find this post hilariously ironic when they posted street fighter, a game infamous for many many re-releases of the same game charged at full price each time. It's basically dlc before dlc existed.

Also let's not pretend street fighter has as many gameplay hours or content as most half decent games today"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I'm gonna get downvoted to wazoo for this, but if ya'll don't like this then you need to be willing to pay more for your games.  If game prices followed inflation they'd be over $130 today.  Compound that with the fact that ~~there are a lot more people to pay~~ *the wealthy people at the top of the companies need a bigger yacht.*

Companies have tried to find ways to increase price, and if we won't pay more for big AAA games they're going to have to make money on the backend.

Unless you all want to overthrow capitalism (I'm on board) this is how it's gonna be."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"People saying SF2 isnt a good example are just repeating 1 idiiot's opinion on the matter. SF2 is a complete game, just because theres 5 different versions or whatever doesnt make them incomplete, the game simply was getting revisions and updates and since there's no way to update the game, they would release a new version."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I can’t argue with that
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"What even is a ""whole game?""  The whole story?

Most games nowadays provide you with the whole story.  Or do you mean story DLC?  Back then we called them sequels, still had to pay extra for more game.

Are you talking about cosmetics?  Games back then didn't have cosmetics at all, so I guess you are still getting the ""whole game"" even though it's less than what's available now.

Kind of a stupid comment to make really.  They were different times.  We just had different names for things."

I fucking payed 80 fucking euros for super deluxe version to be able to play every future shitty expansions but those fucking bastards made a new version later called “ultimate version” which included newest expansion/add-ones for 99€.
So either you pay 99€ for this version or 69€ for expansion/season pass.

When you bought a 30 hour arcade beat em up, you were really buying a 2-3 hour beat em up with a lot of unfair bullshit designed to hinder your progression."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The only game pictured here to successfully inovate and iterate on itself is Zelda. While every subsequent Zelda title features common themes of adventure and gameplay elements, each game brings more new than old to the table. Sonic is formulaic and when they deviate it is complete garbage, so much so that even when the ones that try to recapture what made the Genesis games so special come around they fall short. The original Sonic games broke the sidescroller mold by adding reckless speed, every addition on later consoles failed to do anything new - unless you count vomit inducing camera angles. Mario is Mario. You can make the argument that ""this one has duh raccoon suit doe"" but it very rarely deviates far enough from the Mario formula to feel like something new. The same goes for Kart / Smash / Party / anything else loosely connected to the Mario universe that has sequels. Street Fighter? I don't even need to elaborate there. The point is, it isn't that gaming has become stale. Companies have always been beating dead horses when they find something that works. The only thing that has changed is the availability of games. Cheap monthly subs that give access to hundreds of games, or even just picking up used games is cheaper and easier than ever. This takes away the excitement of renting a game knowing you only have a few days to make the most of it, so you *have to*. These days, I'll sit down with a new game and if I'm not 100% invested in the first 15 minutes I'll likely never touch it again because I have so much else to play."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Modern games have dozens if not hundreds of hours of game play. Then they release dlc and people get upset.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I know it’s easy to say old times are always better, but this isn’t true, there’s still complete games all over the place and even back then they would release incomplete games (Sonic 3) or re-release games a million times with some changes (Street Fighter).

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"You still get the whole game for most worth playing,besides, not all DLC is a bad thing, like with Total War Warhammer where you get DLC support for years with proper big updates for a few bucks"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Tbf, there is an argument to be made about there being less content.  
For arcade games, it was made to be as difficult as possible or that replaying it was a skill based thing, you had to learn to master this tiny slice of content cus that's all you got.

With new content, you still have very little content but it's not been made to last, so you have to buy the next piece of entertainment later on.

I can beat Halo: Reach in a few hours, try that with Ninja Gaiden without having played before and see how quickly it sets you straight!"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Y'all ever heard of the SMB3 (on the GBA) e-levels? The ones you could only play with specific e-cards?
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I don’t mind DLC as long as I feel like I’m getting a real add on that extends my enjoyment of the game. I don’t mind a one-time purchase decision at the end of the game. I don’t want to have to think about money or micro transaction conversions while I’m playing.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"It’s easy to have nostalgia glasses on. But I’d rather the hundreds and hundreds of yearly game releases with half of them being stinkers then how it used to be.

My tip: avoid early access and triple A. Indie games are in a great place right now."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Sure, that’s the case with all of these games that time has deemed classics, but there was PLENTY of busted, unfinished, unplayable garbage released for the 8-but and 16-bit eras. So many of them that AVGN has been able to produce content about them for like, 15 years. This is just looking at the past through rose-colored glasses."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Spending hours in Crash Bandicoot 2 and Tekken 3 progressing in the game. But repeating thise progression cause I don't have any memory cards. Good times.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I just wait a year now and buy the “definitive edition” for $10 less than the release price.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1990?amount=60#:~:text=%2460%20in%201990%20is%20equivalent,rate%20in%201990%20was%205.40%25.

>$60 in 1990 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $127.60 today, an increase of $67.60 over 32 years. The dollar had an average inflation rate of 2.39% per year between 1990 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 112.66%.

>This means that today's prices are 2.13 times higher than average prices since 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index. A dollar today only buys 47.02% of what it could buy back then.

>The inflation rate in 1990 was 5.40%. The current year-over-year inflation rate (2021 to 2022) is now 6.81%."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I don’t mind buying half a game. They need to adjust the price and be transparent about it. That’s all I ask.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Ah yes old games. You were stuck with whatever game breaking bugs for the rest of your life. Those were the days!
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Why would you pick Sonic and SF2 for this? If anything these games pioneered DLC.

SF2 had so many full price ‘updates’ and Sonic had hardware DLC with Sonic and Knuckles."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Maybe its that you want a different game.  Or maybe its because you want to be playing a different game so you make the game you're playing look like that other game instead of just playing it.  Or maybe its that you seem to care more about what others see when you play rather than what you are actually playing.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,yea you bought broken ass games back then too. They just couldnt patch it unless they rereleased the cart
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,uuuuunless you play The Sims
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Play Deep Rock Galactic.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"""Insert coin to continue"" was a microtransaction. And then there were hotlines, strategy guides and magazines. Difficulty was higher because it was the way to get more money out of you. Nothing new under the sun."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I really do hate how industry standards for releasing a game is make it half finished with a battle pass and itll be good in about 5 months
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Now we don't have to buy the whole game again if the developers want to add more content to it later!
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,So true rather than all the AAA games that need to be patched.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,if you buy a game and don't go online or ever connect with your console of choice.  You have the whole game and there will be no long/short update

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,God I fucking hate this subreddit. Like please stop. There are so many amazing games that’s are finished and come out with free DLCs and y’all just choose to ignore it. Not to mention all the games that get ultimate editions with all the DLCs for like twenty bucks.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"My gripe with modern games is I'll go to a physical store to buy a physical copy so I can physically insert it into my physical console and the second it loads I gotta download 100+gb of additional content/updates.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,What are people saying about old games?
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I mean I love retro games too but let’s not forget a full game back then was often able to be completed in an hour once you know how to play it
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I emulate old games because why not
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"say what you will, but id rather download doom in 46 seconds rather than having to buy 8 floppy disks"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"And then once we were done with it that was all there was to do with it. I like the fact that modern games have a development lifespan that includes updates and the injection of fresh content. Old games have their charm, but let's not pretend that Street Fighter is a game on the same scale as modern open world games. The potential for encountering bugs and issues in a game as massive as Red Dead Redemption 2 can't really be compared to the bugs in Sega Genesis and NES games.

Don't forget too that there are a lot of modern games that sucked at launch and were turned into good games over time. Back in the day, if a game sucked, it just died and that was it. It'd be a shame if No Man's Sky had just died at launch. It had plenty of issues to be sure, but the devs were held accountable and a cycle of updates has turned it into a fantastic game.

And as others have mentioned, Street Fighter is about the worst possible game to pick for this comparison, because the Street Fighter games went through a bazillion minor revisions. Seriously, Street Fighter II might have been released almost as many times as Skyrim."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,To me it's absolute insane that a whole generation of video games is designed to make you feel so bad that you want to spend money to skip arbitrary waiting times and have a good time. Wtf is this shit.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,low energy comment for a low energy post
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"How many different versions of Street Fighter II did we need to buy to get the ""whole game""?   6. You have to rebuy the game 5 more times at full retail price (\~$75, \~$150 each by today's standards with inflation) after the initial purchase in order to get all the content that would be DLC add-on content today. And that's not count the ALPHA games."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"When we bought games with bugs that meant you couldn't finish them you were fucked, there was no patch coming. Some games couldn't be finished because the developers ran out of time and just had to put in a bit you couldn't beat. The good old days aren't as good as you think.

Also Street Fighter 2 had like 12 versions."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,To be fair I bought a TON of shitty NES games that would probably be made better by a patch.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I’m happy I lived through that era.

I’m happier that modern technology makes it so that my games get updates to fix bugs (far more inevitable today with the scope of the software vs back then) and expand the content.

Your $60 today pays for more resources and offers you more in return than it did back then."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Remember Golden Sun? I like Golden Sun. Golden Sun was not a complete game.

You’re an absolute clown if you think every game pre-Internet era was released uncut and perfectly how they wanted it to be released. Plenty of unused assets just disappeared or got repurposed for sequels, instead of be added later as either “free updates” or minor expansions."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,There was a whole business in updating the electronics in arcade machines to essentially patch the games
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Sure but old NES and many SNES games are actually tiny compared to modern games. You can beat all of Zelda 2 in a day.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Funny you show sonic which literally delivered half a game in sonic 3 and sold you a second cartridge for the 2nd half at full price.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Sometimes we didn't even get the game at all. Chrono Trigger wasn't sold in Europe on SNES. We had to wait until the NDS.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I think most of the time people forget that creating the quality of todays games takes 100× more work and money to produce than games 30 or 40yrs ago hell even 10. I mean the quaility upgrade alone games should be 120 bucks a peice considering OG Mario was like 30 or 40 bucks in todays money. So yes I think they have to chuck the game up and package it out because games now a days offer 100s of hrs of entertainment and look like movies. Any other form of entertainment that offers you 100s of hours of fun and looks good usually costs hundreds
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah, and most compensated their short campaigns with an elevated difficulty. Games today may have lots of problems, but there are still gems that play hundreds of times better (Hollow Knight, Metroid Dread, Dark Souls, Doom Eternal). I'm not saying this to shit on older games, without those there is nothing to evolve from, but we gotta think about the positives of this era"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Upvoting specifically because you used Zelda II.  That game was hard as balls and doesn't get enough love.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Karma farming or not this is a real problem with modern gaming. I am so tired of feeling nickel and dimed or trapped by a time vampire that uses psychological manipulation to drive ""engagement"" rather than fun. So I won't be playing those sorts of game any more."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,And you also got the bugs that came with them and you never received a patch to fix game breaking bugs. The games also cost more straight up or adjusted for inflation than they do now.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"If it had stayed at just patching out missed bugs in rushed games that would be fine, the worst part was how it normalised quick delivery and led to what we now call DLC.  
When expanding a game essentially required a second full release it obligated devs to put effort in and make enough content to be worth it, The Witcher 3 and its expansion packs are what used to be considered the norm and I hate feeling old for remembering that."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I don’t remember having to pay for every single level in a video game. Except if you count cosmetics as a ESSENTIAL part of the game. So for Fortnite you have to pay thousands just to get the full game apparently

We used to call them expansion packs. What happened was a change of name and the means of distribution of the content.

*""hurr durr but expansion backs were big and worth it""*

Yes, because it also would have to be worth for the company since it involved physical media, physical distribution, etc. DLC doesn't have all those ""physical"" expenses and since it's digital, it can be more fragmented, which can lead to smaller DLC with not as much content. Some DLC are worth the price, some aren't. As always, vote with your wallet."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I really don’t get all the DLC hate. True, if a game releases with barebone content and makes you pay later for the game to actually be playable that’s stupid, but if a game already comes with more than enough content I think it’s okay to pay a little bit for extra content, assuming prices are reasonable"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"That's not to say there weren't stinkers back then though. The Nintendo ""Seal of Quality"" has always been meaningless"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Well... anyone remember Sonic 3, and then Sonic and Knuckles?  That was basically because some content was cut from Sonic 3, and S&K was effectively the missing content (plus some of it's own new stuff)."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"You know why you now have microtransactions and subscriptions and deluxe editions and DLC for nearly all AAA games?  Because the cost for making them has gone up a lot over the course of the last two decades but the box price hasn't.  

The backlash from the default box price going from $50 -> $60 usd was enormous and it caused some of the first games to change their prices to fail outright.  No game dev wants to risk wasting millions or tens of millions of dollars on a game that would have sold well if not for consumer backlash.  

That said, the cost of making games has risen to the point where the box price of AAA games should be somewhere in the $110-120 range so devs and producers need to get creative in how they monetize.  This led to DLC, season passes, lootboxes, cosmetic marketplaces, microtransactions, etc and many of these systems are optimized to extract as much money out of people as possible because only a fraction of the people who buy the game will ever engage with any optional purchases.

I am not writing this to defend the practices that have sprung up from this need to find alternate revenue from a game, but to challenge the complaint that players should be able to buy a full game, with all of the content it will ever have while also benefitting from the massive advances in gaming infrastructure that have happened in the last 20 years, for $60.  Just last year, AAA games have started being priced at $70 and it won't be too long before that price becomes the new standard, but as time passes, that price will fall further and further behind what it really should cost."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Thats a very biased view. 

Games back then were as unfinished, unbalanced or broken as today. They were only called ""finished"" cause there was no tech for a DLC. Any new content would become a new game.

They were much smaller in complexity, graphics and game length, and were developed with much smaller teams, pretty much like todays indie market.

And we don't actually refer to indie market as a benchmark of quality."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yup. Back in the CD/DVD gaming era, even if the game came on multiple discs, the full game was right there, from the moment you bought it. Nowadays, there's DLC for this, and expansions for that etc etc, and licensing, which can remove content, or the entire game itself from the store if you have the game digitally, even if you bought it in full."

Yes, modern gaming did bring some annoying features like micro transactions. But it did bring with it live patching and balancing, which was especially for the game in the bottom picture."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Street fighter 2 was released in installments up until turbo (I think)

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was released as half a game with an option to buy the follow on game. Had the DLC built into the cartridge and everything."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"except for final fantasy 2 (4) - removed entire features of the game, final fantasy 6 (evasion bug means you never miss the enemies in battle), shining force 2 (took away opening chests in battle because of memory). lots of games were incomplete because of memory issues in those old 16 bit games. 

oh and shining force 3 (which came in 3 parts but US only got part 1)"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,what game? xD
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah, sad state of affairs now, when people are paying full price for an early access project that will likely never be finished by Larian..."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Yeah? You also have things like Dead Cells today that continually adds amazing content.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,All of these games are amazing so this doesn't really work......

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"This is something I miss. It was , in games, you would work and work at a level or a boss, and you would find a secret and unlock this whole new level, or world or something cool. 

That was the best part, finding the item, or the world , or warp.. something cool like that.  Don't get me wrong, new games and being able to play with your friends online or make friends all over the world playing a game is the best thing ever.. but we lost a lot of the fun when they started their micro transactions and dlc crap."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The flip side is, we also didn't get F2P games either. Granted, some are terrible money grabs with gambling. But even some of those are built on an entire he that is free. Apex Legends comes to mind. Expensive cosmetics, absolutely. But also one of the most complete and incredible shooters on the market. For free!"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,y u gotta hit me with that painful hadouken truthbomb?
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"This is my issue with the paradox games.  They always feel incomplete because there's always another DLC I don't have.  The subscription model is much better, but then I have to commit to the game."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"As a kid, there was nothing more satisfying than seeing ★96 on the Super Mario World main menu."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I’ll take Halo Infinite over Fester’s Quest TYVM (and yes they cost the same at one point in their lives).

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I do think it’s worth noting that for some Devs whose development cycle is greatly influenced by and/or subject to the whims of investors and board members, DLC serves as a vehicle by which they can produce content that they otherwise would’ve been forced to cut entirely. It’s not always about money. Often, I’m sure, but not always."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Counterpoint: loads of older games were buggy pieces of shit and far more games were incredibly short and were just made more difficult to pad out play time.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"As an older gamer, I don't agree."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah and our games where much much much MUCH shorter yet we still paid 50-60-70 bucks for them.

I hate this whole thinking because people that think and say this completely ignore every other aspect of gaming capability and technology just to make a obvious if faulty point. Yeah it sucks when we get sold unfinished games or when they have obviously cut base content out of the game only to sell it for a extra price later (I'm looking at you Sims 4), but you simply can not compare the game content we got back then to the game content we get nowadays."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Street fighter 2 had at least like 30 different ""Full"" Versions lol. And let's not get started on the whole pokemon gold silver Crystal shit, where they're not going to give you the FULL access to the story / region until the third COMPLETE version comes out later. They've been doing this shit for eons, but at least now they can mitigate the amount of money you have to spend for that mistake.

I'd rather pay a few bucks for DLC than to have to pay full price again for a ""New"" game. Do some games get away with murder overcharging for DLC that isn't worth? Sure, but it's pretty easy to tell what's a cash grab and what's not if you pay enough attention."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,And it worked.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"On the other hand, old games were dead once published. Any bugs or broken bits were forever. The number of 8-bit games that were just unplayable, completely unplaytested etc - with no possibility of a fix."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Every reply is saying the post is wrong, and yet OP has literally thousands of upvotes. /r/gaming is full of children who upvote literally anything that comes across their screen."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"But we also got stuff like Breath of Fire 2, with buggy game play and bad localization with no way for the company to patch in corrections."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"How thick are your rose-tinted lenses? This era of gaming was a fucking nightmare. For every ""classic"" there were hundreds of cash grab rip-offs. No internet to know if a game was good. Refunds were non-existent. And if there was a game-breaking bug there was no way to fix it. And it's not like a game back then was cheap, SNES games were $80."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Most old games were reskins of other games before them. I agree with the overall message, but we only remember the games that stood out back then. Most of those games hardly were fun due to poor controls and unexplained objectives."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I'm sorry but I'm so goddamn tired of this kind of sentiment and the whole ""don't realse a game if it isn't perfect"" mentality. If most of our cult classic and favorite games were released today, we would rip them a new one. All these glitches and expoloties in older games and ""fine"" and ""part of the experience"" but in modern games its a death sentence. People expect every next game in the series to be ""previous game plus 80 new features"" and it never will be. That's what DLC is for, add new features to an existing game. 

The thing that proves to me that forums and internet posts are making it hard for us to enjoy new media is that every time q new thing comes out, the last thing is suddenly golden. The star wars prequels, battlefield 5, the Andrew Garfield spider man movies. Now they are all great even when they were ripped apart when they came out.

Especially with gaming, people we get what they want but the graphics aren't massively better than the other game so the new game is trash. It's getting to the point that and sequels are just gonna get trashed no matter what."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Nobody says anything about old games though. They were awesome.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Uh, there were like six versions of Street Fighter 2 and each of them was a full priced release that had different content.

And there are plenty of times you get the full game these days. You either just need to be patient or buy indie."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Cry more

Edit:  im on the tail end of millenial so im in my 30s, and I think people complaining about this are incredibly whiny.

But thats just a theory, a gamer theory."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Older games had the complexity of a single room in modern games. Shockingly, when you do more, it takes more"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Twenty five cents at a time.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Games were also significantly less complex back in these days, most would barely count as ""Apps"" in today's market with the expectations users and players have."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yea they were also 30 minutes to 1 hour long and cost almost as much as today's games lol.

Also, plenty of complete games today. You're just buying the wrong games."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Some games even came with more RAM! Not joking, Donkey Kong 64 came with the memory expansion that allowed it to be played lol"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Most could be completed in an hour though.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Except for the Legacy of Kain series
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Super Mario Bros 3 could really use some DLC costumes. Nintendo is already getting ideas.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Same companies that made those old games make the newer ones too. And there are examples of instances where you didn’t get a whole anything. Exclusivity has been around since the dinosaurs. 

When things are unregulated/ relatively new, companies can and have always got away with BS."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,BUT WAIT…there’s more…
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I'm not sure that super 64 could be considered a completely whole game.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"""You will own nothing and be happy"""
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,The Lost Levels would have been dope as a Super Mario Bros expansion pack or DLC
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Playtime for the original Legend of Zelda was 8-9 hours... If you take inflation into account that game cost the equivalent of $130 back then... As opposed to BOTW's price of $80 (I am Canadian, is that $60 American???) Compare that to BOTW's play time and tell me which game is a better deal. 

I get what they are trying to do here, slag on DLC... But you are still getting a hell of a deal compared... DLC should be something extra to enhance a game you like... Not a completion piece (I am looking at you Dragon Age: Inquisition). If you don't want the extra content, don't buy it... Simple as that. 

And on a related note. Maybe if we stopped being such dicks about release delays, these companies would be less worried about making us wait for completed, less buggy games. It's really as much our fault as theirs."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Thing is buying a dlc is like paying for more of the game but yeah I agree not buying dlc it feels like you are being ripped off and must feel even worse for a completionist
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah I’ll say what I will about old games, they’re awesome"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"As an older gamer, this is blown out of proportion. Every one of my PS5 games is a ""whole game,"" with at worst some optional DLC for vanity items or \*gasp\* additional missions."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,The level of code required to create a modern game is astronomical compared to what was required for older games.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,There were a lot of games released as glitchy messes. So not too different from today
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Hell at least now the internet has given a form for people to talk, report, and warn each other about various games. If a game is buggy at launch you're pretty guarenteed to know about it unless you're intentionally trying to avoid spoilers.

I remember buying games from a shop, and it practically being a coin flip of wether you were going to get a well made game, or an asset flipped, buggy mess.

The ""old games good, new games bad"" crowd are exactly the same as the ""old music good, new music bad"" crowd. Of course you only know about the good old games. Because we don't really talk about the utter stinkers that got released alongside them. Gaming was just as marred by money grubbing, fast turnarounds, buggyness, and outright lies back when I first started, as it is now."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I don't think anyone says anything bad about old games lmao

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Its so true.
I really miss the days when a game was released and that was it. Thats the game, If it had some funny bugs they became fun little things to show off to your friends  or when weapons that were OP the community self regulated.

And occasionally you could buy DLC.

Like Imagine a band releasing an album with half the songs unfinished, and then you slowly get bits and parts of the new songs sent to you but oops now the one song you really liked on the album was just changed completely in the new update and now it sounds like shit."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Except all the content they had to cut for ROM space and time which ended up lost forever. At least now content that didn't make the cut can be released as a part of an expansion or DLC.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Sonic 3 being released unfinished and having to buy Sonic and Knuckles with the lock on feature to play the complete game. Mario 2 wasn’t released in the US and instead we got another game with paint over it to fill demand for sequel. The excuse of a Street Fighter game released on the NES or PAC-MAN on the Atari.

Edit: Totally forgot, the Sega version of Mortal Kombat was literally released with incomplete sprites, yet at the time was considered the definitive home release do to the gore code."

Mega Man on the DS did that too, you got extra stuff if you had copies of previous games. Then someone realized that spending time playing games you already had would be less time spending money on new games."

When it was ported to PC a certain platform unexpectedly shifted during the transfer, making a certain jump literally impossible, and therefore making the game unbeatable."

Street Fighter 2 had a about a zillion and three progressive editions in both arcades and on consoles that could be variously considered patches and expansions by today's standards -- Each on a new $50 cartridge. And if you want to think of it that way, the original versions had the boss fighters ""cut"" and added in later on a successive full price cartridge release. (Their data was obviously already in the game, but you couldn't play as them.)"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,I just want to say that I don't think DLC is a problem. The problem is when fully completed content is locked behind a paywall on release. DLC brings games longevity and gives players a reason to come back.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,95% of the NES and SNES library is literally unfinished buggy trash.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Honestly, you just have to buy the right games. There are plenty of great devs still providing full, working games upon release and frankly it's the fault of consumers for continually purchasing games from known bad actors."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Mostly because in the old days there were fewer options of selling people a game piecemeal.

Of course pokemon has a tradition of only selling you half the game and forcing you into social interactions with someone who bought the other half. At least today you no longer need a gamelink cable.

Publishers also had a habit of selling what was essentially DLC as a completely new game. Reusing the engine and assets but different levels.

For PC gaming I fondly remember Migh & Magic where game IV and V combined into one game when you installed both.

Also shareware used to be a thing. You got a game with the first few levels or so for free and then had to pay for the rest."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I mean, there are definitely still games where you buy the full game straight-up. Wreckfest is a good example. The DLC isn't stuff that's ripped out to be sold to us later, it's genuinely new content."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,You still get a whole game with most modern games. You're mistaking DLC as if it was content cut from the original game. Where it's actually extra content. Name one time you got a SNES/Genesis game update? Shit we didn't even really get that during PS2/GC/Xbox era.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Yeah playing borderlands 2 and I’m not even done yet and still have to play there dlcs
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I used to be enraged by microtransactions, pay to win, lootboxes, etc. But there are plenty of great games that don't do that. People also complain about early access but I remember when most full games you played were more broken than a lot of early access title people complain about these days. E.g. I love bannerlord, there is a lot wrong with it but I really doubt it would have come out completely done before early access was a thing. They would release it in more or less the same condition and then patch it. It's good that people have higher standards now but it's also good review your perspective now and then. Do your research and vote with your wallets and there will generally be games for you. Not everyone in the industry is engaging in the microtransaction cash grab or pulling a fast one with early access."

Modern games even with some features locked behind DLC right off the bat or features missing at launch and patched in later hold infinitely more value and often times at cheaper prices than those old cart games cost back in the days. For example Secret of Mana for SNES was a whopping $80.00 brand new at retail.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Damn a lot of devs on here defending DLC. Very few games had DLC back then, not a great comparison to today's standards. Not to mention day one updates. Having always connected consoles does really enable the developers to speed up the testing phase of development. Some even just relying on the community to find the bugs (looking at you GTA remastered)

But that's besides the point. I get it that DLC is made to keep players enjoying the game, but part of me sometimes feels like part of the original game was sectioned off with DLC red tape and sold separately, that or it's put into micro transaction mechanics. Game dev companies are a business, I get it. But I doubt this extra cash flow is going to the devs (corp bonus probs) and I wonder if the profit margin on games has shifted up over the years as they install new ways to reach into gamers wallets."

It's bullshit to say that old games gave you more bang for your buck"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Exactly what I was going to say -- not sure that paying full price for the 'Championship Edition', or whatever it was called, was better than buying four characters as DLC like you would these days."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Or Sonic. Sonic & Knuckles was like the first expansion there was.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,And out of all Zeldas they picked Zelda 2. Probably the least polished and most broken one to date. I feel like this image was created by an AI and not a gamer.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,If anything fighting games have benefitted the most from the new model. Balance updates and characters dripfed through a game's lifetime is a much more sustainable model than release a whole new game for every update/addition of character.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"It's not a great example to prove OP's point, but I think it's a fantastic example to show how people today like to jump on the bandwagon and talk about the ""good old days"" as if they really were better, when they were not. There are plenty of games that release today in fully featured form, but because they plan to eventually release DLC, gamers whine that they're ""unfinished.""

A game like Donkey Kong Country 3 can be completed 100% in less than 5 hours without speedrunning. It may have been a ""whole game,"" but you were paying $106 in today's money for that <5 hour experience. Contrast that with Mass Effect 3, which was a more popular modern game that was panned for being ""incomplete"" because of DLC released soon after launch. That game cost about $72 in today's money and is a complete experience that takes over 30 hours without even doing all the side missions.

I will absolutely take the state of today's gaming industry over the state it was in the 90's."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Also people seem to forget that back then games took a lot less time and resources to make.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah, I actually think fighting games are a good example of a genere where updates rather than a new game help.

Like, 3rd Strike is great, but it would be better if we could update the game so Chun-Li was balanced"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Or Sonic 3
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"No shit.  When sf2 was first released on snes you couldn't play as m.bison, saggat,  Vega or Balrog(I think)  but you had to fight them in the game.  What a disappointment it was for 14yo me.  On top of that when they released ssf2turbo it cost $80 fucking dollars!  In like 1991(2,3?)"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Well said. I genuinely don't think I've ever bought a game and felt short changed in terms of it not being a ""full game"". It feels like people are shelling out for products they know have DLCs then complaining they didn't get those DLCs for free."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I love the steam reviews that bash a game and the user has like 400 hours. Like, number one, if it was that bad why did you spend that long in it? And two, did you not get 400 hours worth of content for 60 bucks? Hell I bought DayZ when the standalone early access came out for 30 bucks and the game was broken af but I got so many hours of enjoyment out of it."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Also people buy the game play it, finish it and are saying ""not a full game"" when devs sell some costumes to use in multiplayer."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Breath of the wild. Such a great game
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Also, anyone old to actually remember playing these games should also remember they were maybe 15-20 hours long at best. The “complete” game was shorter than most DLCs these days"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Yeah.  Because of course only the complete games that were the highlights of our childhood would be used as examples of better times.  There were shit incomplete games that existed in the past too.  Very much like how you said there are complete games today.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yea I don't get the argument that games ship incomplete today.  I feel like those people just aren't interested in the single player experience because off the top of my head I can name spiderman, God of war, Forza horizon, dark souls, blood borne, sekiro, batman, GTA, red dead redemption, hollow knight, hades, Ori, horizon zero dawn, Zelda, Mario, super smash bros, fire emblem, DMC 5, astral chain.  That's just off the top of my head."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Also just because a game has patches and dlc doesn't mean it wasn't released complete
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Expansions used to be a necessity too because for a game to have a player base, it needed to be on store shelves. So even online games like EQ would have to churn out expansions just to get new inventory to put on shelves. I remember games just dying because there was literally no way for a new player to get the game."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Quake's mission packs were so cool to me as a kid. Like ""WOAH! They made the game even bigger than it already was?! This is incredible.""

A game I already loved getting more stuff to do on it? What's not to like?

Almost three decades later and I still quite like the idea tbh. It's not always done well but I only buy the good DLC. As in, what we used to call expansion packs. But with the advantage of the Internet media these days I can easily determine if its a good expansion pack, or a bad one before buying it. As well as if the price is too high for what it is.

YouTube and howlongtobeat are great tools for this."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Older games also released what was there and that was it. 'Cut' content wasn't readily available for consumers. 

The bad games also aren't remembered. If the game sucked for gameplay reasons then generally no one is still talking about it 25years later

Like Goldeneye 64, there were plans to do a unique map (maybe weapons) for each bond movie. 
They released it with only the two extra maps. That was it."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Expansions were huge back in the days. Just look at what the Diablo 2 Expansion ""lord of destruction"" added to the game for $20. Now you barely get a ingame skin or mount for that money."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"DLC should always have work done after the base game release. They may have plans and partially got work done by the original release, but the DLC content should have been finished later.

Witcher 3 comes to mind, the central character of the first DLC was introduced in the tutorial. Great bit of foreshadowing there."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"AoE 2 still gets expansions, but the first one was really a big step up from the base game (the Conquerors expansion...)."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Expansions had a lot more content than DLCs though. Some were practically a whole new game (StarCraft: Brood War, Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge, Half-Life: Blue Shift/Opposing Force, etc.)"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Still a full length sonic game in its own right.  If sonic 3 was released with everything in sonic and knuckles too, it would have been far too long, they would have cut a ton of content and we would never have been able to enjoy the games as they are today.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Don’t forget that games were way more expensive than even the “super duper platinum editions” are today. Street Fighter 2 was $75 at launch, which is equivalent to $140 today. And then you had to buy it again 12 months later to get the new updates."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I remember hearing that Superman 64 was so successful that they where considering making a PlayStation version, best thing about modern gaming is learning if a game is complete trash before buying it."

Not to mention, two of the four games in the picture are some of the worst offenders of the very thing this meme is protesting. Sonic 3 was explicitly released half-finished and Street Fighter 2 *never* stopped coming out with updated versions that had to be re-bought at full price."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I don't know why people always set themselves up for failure by pre-ordering games, especially anything from the ""AAA"" industry. How hard is it to wait a couple of days for reviews to see if the game is complete and/or has bugs before buying it?"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Back then game developers had to make incredibly difficult games so that people didn't feel ripped off for buying a game realistically with 3 hour play times.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Exactly. To beat games like TMNT, battle toads, etc you had to replay each section 100 times it was so difficult. Remove the difficulty and they are like 4 hours long..."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Considering most of those old games would fit within the filespace of a single texture in many modern games.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,my first super metroid playthrough was like 6 hours lol
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Actually games were still 50-60$ way back when shelves were stocked with NES and SEGA titles
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,The whole game might have been a shorter experience for the end user but alot of the technology we take for granted now was being pioneered. Good games still took a long time to develop.  Super Mario brothers 3 took 2 years or close to it.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Nailed it right here. For every Super Mario 3 (a full, fun, gem of a game) there were 20 games that were pure garbage, the same price, and you had no way of knowing it until you bought or rented it. 

Go download a complete ROM list for NES, SNES, even PS1. 95% of the games were absolutely unplayable."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Red Dead Revolver average playtime for main story and some side quests: 8hrs

Read Dead Redemption: 18hrs

And RDRevolver came out in 2004, so not that long ago. 

Most games had no multiplayer. 

Red Alert 1 had like 4 unit types.

Newer games are better, and when they launch broken or incomplete they can be patched. Not like ET or Superman 64."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I can go even further back. Argument is still the same, the games were short, hard and unforgiving. Not only that, to restart you had to rewind the bloody cassette. I love where gaming is now and where it’s going."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Console gaming almost collapsed. Which was pretty much dominated by the Atari 2600 at the time (other systems existed, like the Intellivision and Colecovision, but they had a fraction of the market). 

Computer gaming, like on the Vic 20, C64, Atari 8 bit line of computers, and DOS (among many other highly successful systems) was kicking ass and taking names without pause at the time."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"And that's only a very visible difference.

If you get into it, it's mind-blowing how much bigger games are, any games, today. And not just in terms of disk space, but in terms of labor. Even a derivative, mediocre but not shitty Steam game today has much more handmade original assets, script, animations, game mechanics, items, and missions/quests in it than 3-5 old classic games (aside from very specific exceptions and only then in the sense of length, like an RPG with tons of text or dozens of repetitive quests).

Hell, a copycat cash-grab 3-in-row puzzle game today HAS to have more polished art and refined ""feel"" to it than some of the best classics, even while it steals a lot of it from its peers (and the classics themselves ofc). The best, largest AAA games today are marvels of management, it's basically a miracle they don't crumble in on themselves the moment you launch them."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"In fact, go to any ROM website and you’ll notice that all these games were, in fact, patched. Repeatedly.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Even back then there were cases of games getting released unfinished. Diablo II is a famous example, the LoD expansion was supposed to be part of the main game but wasn’t finished."

There is a ton of garbage titles that consoles are replete with, but 40 years of multiple consoles with some heavy hitters will surely beat out the current generation when it comes to 10/10 games.

I prefer older games because new games are enormous time sinks. I don't have 90 hours in my life to dedicate to a video game being in my mid-30s."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,And they also made games hard as shit back then to cover up the fact that the game had about 3 hours of content in it
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,">They purposely made games harder back then so kids would rent them more

So that consumers would buy them, not rent them more. Video game company companies didn't make money off rentals back then aside from the store itself purchasing the copies."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,That's been happening a lot with recent new fighting games. They launch with 10\~14 characters and people get mad that they don't have as much content as all these other fighting games that have had several years worth of DLC to fill out their rosters.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,See: every sports game ignoring offline modes (you know... the game modes the genre was built on) in favor of putting 90% of their time and effort into Ultimate Team shit full of microtransactions and pay to win mechanics.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,OP didn’t say gaming now was bad. Just pointed out that games actually had to be finished before they were released back in the day.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"They seem complete because you knew no difference. They didn’t have patches as an option, so the games seemed “complete” to people when unfinished and buggy games still existed in great numbers. Don’t fool yourself."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"To me that’s the biggest difference. Back then, every game cost a fortune even if it was put together on a tiny budget."

people being unwilling to pay more than 10 extra bucks per generation (give or take) while development costs and advertising keep on getting more expensive, is one of the reason they try to gouge us with dlc, cheap plastic figures and picture books."

Obviously there are shitty companies doing shitty things with DLC and microtransactions, but there's also a decent amount that are just parts of the game that never would have released at all if DLC didn't exist.

Also, instead of a $10 DLC pack, if they did release the extra cut content, it was in another full price special addition release, where the only changes were the addition of extra content.

KH vs Persona 5 is a pretty good modern example of this. Persona 5 Royal is just added story missions, and easily could have been a $20 DLC pack like KH3 Remind. Instead it's another full price $60 to get the Royal content."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The only thing legitimately better in the old days was the game manuals. You'd get these thick little books with detailed information about the whole game, lore, illustrations... I used to carry them around and read them for fun. Nowadays, you have to buy special editions to get lore/art booklets, and even a good manual is probably just a PDF link on the Steam page.

The flipside is that there wasn't any other  good way to get information about a game, so the manual was your only resource - but not all modern games have good online documentation, especially if they're single player and not hugely popular. More often than not I'm stuck trying to glean answers from a dead wiki or a Discord server that moves too fast to get a word in edgewise."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yep, and then with Game Pass you have even more access to games. I remember only being able to afford a handful of games each year when I started working my part time job in high school. I also never really kept games, I’d beat them and then sell to Game Stop for a fraction of what I had paid for the game.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Have Ultima Online flashbacks here. 

You're completely correct however. Before things like day 1 patches and stuff, expansions were crucial to both fix issues in the original game, rebalance it if it was needed (like Starcraft as an example), increase playerbases and thus get more customers, keep the franchise alive, and keep people excited with the brand/studio. 

As awful as Blizzard is now (not talking the studio issues here although those are awful too I mean their games) there was a time when Blizzard was beloved. A fiasco like the Warcraft 3 reforged edition would have never happened 20 years ago. You could expect the game to be an easy 7/8 out of 10 minimum and often even higher.

People would buy it for the name ""Blizzard"" on the box alone. 

They got that way by not only offering fairly polished games, but regular expansions, and staggered their releases so one of there games was always the talk of the community at least every 2 or 3 years. 

A lot of companies don't need to do that anymore. They can make a game, throw a 50gig day 1 patch, open a player store, and make more money than they ever would've in the 90s and early 2000s where they probably wouldn't have their game even considered if it wasn't from an established/trusted company. 

This is both awesome for many indie devs and awful for many predatory practices. 

But this also killed the ""need"" for expanisons too. Especially with the internet news cycle. You don't need a 6 page article in Game Informer talking about your expansion for the most popular game 2 years ago due in stores in 4 months.

You make a tweet and poof. Company you haven't seen much of in 5 years suddenly has the most anticipated game for that year.

Not sure if it's better or worse but it's how the system aged so here we are. 

Fucking horse armor. Started all this shit. Thanks Bethesda."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The Quake mission packs had as many maps as the base game and usually a bunch of new gameplay mechanics to go with them.

Some present-day DLCs are like that too, but only some."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Sort of. There was an expansion pack that could be physically inserted into the N64. This wasn't really paid DLC, it was more like a graphic card upgrade for a PC that let's you play more advanced games. Or in this case, a literal upgrade for the N64."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"That was a RAM expansion for the N64, certain games required it like Donkey Kong 64, a few others ran at a higher resolution with it."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"What you are thinking of was the 4 MB RAM expansion. It just gave the console more capability.

You may be mixing that up with the fabled N64 DD which had a VERY limited release in Japan and didn't do well. It was an attachment that you put your Nintendo on and it used these big cartridges with a lot more storage were able to get larger games. I don't think it was ever used as a DLC but it could have.

Honestly they should have went with CDs instead of cartridges for the DD and put the stuff that needed to be accessed quickly on the cartridge and slower stuff, like FMVs and the soundtrack, on the DD."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"For No Mercy, they released a free version that you had to request through some magazine that fixed an issue with saves randomly disappearing off the cartridge.

Now you get like a map, or a ""cool"" skin or something."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Some of them were, but it was hardly universal, much like today.

DLC is pretty much exactly the same as expansions used to be in general.

You generally paid more for popular game expansions that had more content, and less for expansions for more obscure games or that only included a little bit of content.

If you actually look at it, DLC is pretty much exactly the same thing and hasn't changed much.

I'm not talking about microtransactions, but expansion style DLC that we see in today's games."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"It’s true. Expansions were often loaded with hours of solid content and new features.

DLC still qualify as expansions, but they do seem to be smaller, and more numerous … and expensive without a “season pass”. lol"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Thing is DLC is often made by developers who have no work left to do on the base game and are out on the DLC specific budget. So work does get done because they no longer need the big teams of designers, writers, artists and coders to fix the bugs. 
So they make those plans in advance and gives plenty of time to create new content, test, polish and bug fix. So it can be released whilst the game still has interest"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,"Seriously. I get the frustration of releases like Cyberpunk 2077 and No Man's Sky, etc.

But also, I'm glad that games are able to be patched post-release now. In the 90s if a game was bad or had bugs we were just shit out of luck."

Sonic 2 had 10 levels that had 2 acts each with the last level having 3 acts. So you ultimately get over 20 levels again with this game.

Sonic 3 had 6 levels that had 2 acts each. That’s 12 levels.

Sonic and Knuckles had 6 levels that had 2 acts each. That’s 12 levels.

I love Sonic but saying that Sonic 3 is a “full length game in its own right” is just wrong when comparing it to past Sonic games. 

> If sonic 3 was released with everything in sonic and knuckles too, it would have been far too long

No, it would have damn near the same amount of levels that the first two games had before it.

Edit: as others have pointed out, Sonic 3 also features no ending to the story, it just rolls the credits after you beat the boss and as a kid you were left very confused."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"As I said in another comment, it's also worth noting that the knuckles cartridge could have Sonic 2 plugged into it to allow you to play Knuckles in Sonic 2 as well which was not part of the original plan at all."

In other words, it was the exact same game as the Super NES version - both had Champion Editon and Turbo modes."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,That Sonic and Knuckles game was good value though in that it could be combined with other games. You could play as Knuckles in Sonic 2 and for other games you would play special stages unique to that game. Sonic 3 was kinda short though but probably became the best game on the Genesis once you combined it with Sonic & Knuckles.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Strictly speaking Sonic 3 was supposed to be twice the size as it turned out to be - the developers had to cut it to make the release date - it was the cut bits that made it into Sonic and Knuckles.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Apparently true, but I was none the wiser as a kid. Sonic 3 felt like a full game to me at the time, if I recall S&K wasn't full retail nor was it widely known that it was in the pipeline when S3 was released. It was a nice addition with tons of replay."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I love Zelda 2, but I’ll concede that the difficulty is a little unforgiving and the leveling system is a bit unbalanced.

The first problem is easily fixed by playing in modern emulation. Create periodic save states before each dungeon, and give yourself permission to reverse time and undo any particularly cheesy deaths.

For the second problem… just put on a podcast or something and grind for a while early on. It’s a bit boring but it’s something to do at the end of the day when your brain is fried but you’re not yet ready for bed. After that, it becomes much easier to actively enjoy the endgame."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Exactly! And at the time, it wasn't even different from the LoZ formula. It was the second game, so there was no formula yet. I suck at the game and haven't beaten it, but I honestly think it's more fun than the first."

Nowadays? Credits take 3 hours to finish listing everyone who worked on a game. There's thousands of people in there. 

They had 1 or 2 years to make a game but they actually finished making it with months to spare so they had the time to polish it and put extra shit in it for players to find. 

Doom was made by like 5 people. Golden Eye with like 10 people, etc."

Just from inflation alone, not counting the increased production costs, $60 in 1987 is equivalent to $136.70 in 2020.  
I’d rather pay $60 and have the option to buy more content if I like the game, than for the base cost to be $100+ and have the extra content included."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The maps in Sonic 3 are WAY longer. Look at the glitchless speedruns. Sonic 3&K is around 1 hour, and Sonic 2 is around 20 minutes. 

I know they were conceived as separate projects, but Sonic 3 alone is a fairly meaty Sonic game based on runtime. It also seems shorter in retrospect because it had save ability, which Sonic 2 didn't have."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,"I agree! The other thing is that games do become long in the tooth.

For instance, I still played my Atari 2600 for quite a long time until 2014-ish when I bought a PS4. Seeing the two connected to the same television and my clear preference toward the PS4 made me realize just how basic and unrewarding playing the 2600 was.

I used to say that the NES would never die for me, but the early arcade-style games are too basic. For the life of me I can't play Ice Climber, Joust, or even Donkey Kong Jr. anymore. Modern gaming offers more immersive experiences.

The sweet spot seems to be the 16-bit and 32-bit eras like the SNES and PS1. The Sega Saturn and SNES had some truly beautiful, engaging games with gorgeous pixel art. These games aren't bogged down by insane trophy requirements and an additional 40 hours of side quests. That's what kills modern games for me.

At least with free to play MT-laden trash, you're not out any money trying it out and finding out it's shit.  It was the worst back in the day when all you had was your copy of Nintendo Power or EGM guiding your purchase (or if you were smart, your rental), and you went and bought something like NARC instead of Mega Man 3.

When you finish a palace you get enough experience to reach your next level, so you want get as much free experience from this as possible. So for example if your attack is at level 4 and your magic and life are at level 1, you can get almost 2000 free experience for completing a palace. The longer you can hold off on leveling the other two stats, the more effective this strategy is."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yup. Another good example would be Pokemon. SwSh's issues as games notwithstanding, I would much rather pay 50% of the price of the base game for Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra than full price again for something like  Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Nah, you're right. Sonic 3 works as well and lets you play the actual full game."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"It did work with Sonic 2; it let you play S2 with Knuckles, who could bypass most of the levels by climbing and gliding, and had a harder time with boss fights because Red Echidnas can't jump."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"This precisely.  I remember how Marble Garden Zone felt so huge compared to zones of the past.

Ice Cap and the last zone were the only to feel shorter/more classic in length.  Ice Cap’s was mostly due to the snowboarding bits."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Gold is for losers.  Silver is for closers.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,But what is a complete game? You can add an infinite amount of content to every game; does that mean every game is incomplete?
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Most of the games that people complain about having DLC have ongoing support for the game, which costs money. Like when a game adds new stuff, that stuff has to be designed, art assets need to be made, if it’s a new system code needs to be written (programmer time is typically very expensive in comparison to designers and artists, I know this as a game designer.) 

So do you want your fighting game to add new fighters to keep the game fresh or not? Do you want new cosmetic rewards in your RPGs? That stuff costs money - a lot more money than it did in 1990 when these assets were 16bit and the dev teams were like 4 people. Yet the initial cost of the game has not even adjusted for inflation. Many AAA online games would be being sold at a loss for $60 without MTX sales (or a monthly fee which everyone also complains about) when you factor ongoing live team and server costs."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"The ""complete"" game in the past was 1-2 hours of actual content with an extreme difficulty curve to make it feel longer.

An ""incomplete"" modern game might still have a 30 hour campaign and several multiplayer modes."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"It doesn't even feel like 20 levels. I was thinking like...6-8 for some reason? Are we considering ""screens"" as levels? Because I remember blowing through it up until the last 2 levels or so."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah as a kid I thought Chrono Trigger was this huge epic, but on NG you can easily complete it in under 20 hours first try unless you're going blind trying to 100% every Subquests. 

Meanwhile something like Dragonquest XI is over 80 hours easily."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah Turbo was a port of the arcade ""Hyper Fighting"" game, but the second mode replicated Champion Edition.

I liked the Super NES pad, I got used to it to the point that I preferred it over the arcade stick 6-button setup."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,"Not early; the game wouldn't fit on a single cartridge, so they released it in two parts (with Sonic & Knuckles being the second part), so that they could still meet a promotional deadline with McDonalds."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yes, and a lot of people may not know this, but you can beat a palace without having to take the level-up if you jump past the statue at the end. Which is helpful because I find palaces are one of the best places to gain XP. So you can do a very small amount of grinding by going through the first few palaces a couple of times each for XP and skipping the level-up. Then when you’re six levels away from having everything maxed, just go through all the palaces again (which should now be fast and easy) to get those last few levels super-fast. This also saves you from having to level skills unevenly if you don’t feel like doing that strategy."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Exactly. It was completely different from the first and subsequent LoZ games, but that's it. It was a fun, solid game by itself, if a bit different from the normal."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Yeah my friend bought it for me for Christmas one year so I played it as to not waste his money.

It was cool getting all the extra post game stuff but it definitely made my original purchase feel hollow.  USUM was the game they could have made if they had just delayed release for a year or so.

But they know they don't have to because pokemon fans (and their families in the case of younger players) will just keep buying these games and Pokemon keeps making the billion$"
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"And the really dumb thing is every time you try to point out that the DLC model is better than the 3rd version model they had been doing people *always without fail* instantly point out that buying SM and USUM is cheaper than SwSh+DLC as if that is relevant to the discussion.  
  
like... bruh. You seriously okay with buying the same game multiple times at full price just because one of the games has a couple of new things? Get with the times."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Ok fair.  On the GBC and GBA games they used nearly all the space they had on the game itself, let alone the specifics of your save file

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"There is nothing to modify. The secrets already exists in Banjo-Kazooie (6 colored eggs and the Ice key) and can be collected on a normal cartridge if you happen to know what passwords to put into in the sand castle in Treasure Trove Cove (can be found online). The problem is that in B-K they are just a collectable but they don't DO anything and they were supposed to in Tooie which was supposed to be the ""Stop-N-Swop"" system to unlock some extra goodies. Stop-N-Swop was never implemented into Tooie.

Rare had EVERY intention of making this work, it's why they built the collectables into Kazooie from the onset. The idea was that in some way you were to swap the cartridges from Kazooie to Tooie while the console was running and reset in some regard if I remember correctly. The concept was built around how the N64 used it's RAM and there was originally enough time to pull off such a thing and have stored memory from one game in the games RAM when switching to the other. Hence how Tooie would have known that you had the collectables. Unfortunately between the release of Kazooie and Tooie Nintendo made adjustments in future releases of the N64 and the timing window reduced to a degree that it simply was not possible. As a result Stop-N-Swop was never truly implemented into Tooie and we have no idea what the initial plans were."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I'm guessing he only recently checked eBay. Some people are supposedly raising the price of their PS4 on there. Since people can't get a PS5 because of scalpers, others are being assholes and raising the price for the PS4 to take advantage of it. They would see new ones on there for that much, it people selling collectors edition pro models, and then think their old, dusty model is worth the same. 

Shit like this is why I don't really collect retro games anymore."

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,The Sega Saturn has a similar expansion cartridge with the same issues.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"usually there's a bit of tension when you get to a Sonic final boss... like most games. Besides, the story set up certain things, like a floating island that never floats, Knuckles being tricked by Robotnik, which is never really brought up. These things are brought up in Sonic and Knuckles, which is what's really just the second half of the game, and it shows. Just compare the final boss and ending of Sonic 2. It was, at the very least, a massive downgrade."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"It had an epic mix version of the soundtrack, a cool animation of all levels you've been going through while the credits where shown and the final image was different depending on getting all the emeralds or not. 

9y old me was blown away in '91, it was not like games had a full blown cutscene after finishing anyway."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,This too! Several zones fully changed their appearance mid-gameplay (such as Angel Island pre- and post-fire; Sandopolis inside and outside of the pyramid; and so on).
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Also most of those older songs were on the pop charts in their respective times
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,It's the same like blaming EA for releasing a new FIFA each year. They just want things for the cheapest price possible and even that would be too much for them
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I think the frustration comes from content that is held back from the main game for DLC. I remember Dragon Age: Origins having a Day 1 DLC character that was *clearly* developed as part of the main campaign then removed.

You also had to pay money on day 1 for the DLC that gave you inventory storage."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,The part where it gets offensive is when features from previous games are sold back to you at an added charge or when important parts of the story are missing behind a paywall. A terrible example would be Asura's Wrath for ps3/xbox360 where the entire last 1/5 of the game including the ending was released as dlc. In these cases you're not buying more content but instead buying less of a game.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,A bearded dragon is a lizard my guy 🤦‍♂️
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,"What are you people even talking about when you say this?  
There's plenty of games from SNES and onward with hours and hours of gameplay.  
Chrono Trigger, all the Final Fantasy games, Spyro The Dragon, Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Viewtiful Joe, Okami, GTA series, God Of War and soooooooo many more all had 8-20 hours and in many cases hundreds of hours worth of gameplay.  

People in this thread are looking at this as if it's old Atari and Arcade coin guzzlers.  When in reality games have absolutely been cutting content for the ability to sell you more later.  

In some respects it makes sense and is well worth it.  When they include what is nearly a sequel for half the price.  You know, a real and classic Expansion Pack.
But often it's just a weapon pack or skin on a game that had none to unlock but still cost $70+."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Too many game developers think longer is better now. I miss the 20-30 hours it took for a main story and then optional side quests. Nowadays we're looking 60+ hours for story and up to 100 or more for side quests. Who's got time for that especially when a bug chunk of that time just feels like filler.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,Delaying the game wouldn't make the originals have that content. They made that content specifically to sell you the extra games.
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Honestly is because USUM exist I think SM are the worst main games of the franchise, specially because personally I don't like the plot of SM, so it having too much cutsene is a con for me."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,">like... bruh. You seriously okay with buying the same game multiple times at full price just because one of the games has a couple of new things? Get with the times.

And this is a bad argument. There are a lot of people who *only* buy the 3rd version. Or, if they *do* buy both versions, they can sell off the original (likely for nearly the same price they bought it for, as pokemon game prices rarely go down). You cannot do that with DLC.

It's okay to prefer DLC, and I don't have a problem with DLC in general. But how it has been implemented with Pokemon is bad. You paid $60 for an incomplete game and another $30 for short additional content and cannot recoup any part of that cost and still play the game. I welcome DLC, as long as we get a game that feels complete as the base game that the DLC is being added to. If they stuck with the old model, you could enjoy the full content by just paying $60 for a 3rd version. In order to experience the DLC, you have to pay $90 and there is no way around that. And there is no game worth $90 in my mind."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Also, fun fact: there was a ton of extra space on black/white at least - there were various ds card sizes, based on powers of 2. Black and white roms go on a 512MB card, but can be trimmed to like 280, so that's the actual size they needed - just over the next smallest size, 256. So if the eShop infrastructure was there, I think they theoretically could have made a DLC. The DS was just a little too early, I think."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"I mean, 98% of all games are hot garbage. The Commodore 64 had some 20,000 games released in it's lifetime. About 200 or so are well remembered, and many of those were cross platform titles like the various Gold Box RPGs, Bard's Tale, and Ultima, or arcade ports. Only a scarce few were only found on the C64."
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"For anyone wanting to see this in action today: go to the PC game section of any Walmart Supercenter.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-10,"I noped out a few years ago when the mom and pop store near me started setting their prices to ebay+$5, and using the gamestop trade in tool to value games for credit. They didn't do cash for games, but gave you the gamestop cash offer for store credit.

Their reasoning sounded alright on the surface level, to cut down on people buying from them and selling for a profit. It didn't sit right with me though when that meant used PS4 games were $55. Like at that point, I might as well let GME fuck me"

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,DK64 didn’t even take advantage of the expansion pack. It was used as a workaround for a bug that would crash the game since they never could figure out the cause.

rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,that's why one was included free bundled with the game
rzsalw,2022-01-09,2022-01-09,"Specifically, the game had a memory leak the devs could never track down. Eventually the system would run out of memory and crash the game. By adding more RAM with the expansion pack, it took a lot longer for the memory to run out and crash the game. The game would crash after ten hours, not ten minutes. The devs figured people probably wouldn't play that long all in one sitting, so it was okay. After all, the memory got reset every time the players turned off the console."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-11,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the story goes like this:

A brother and sister are playing in their tree house when it collapses, killing both of them. Both are taken to the Limbo, what some theologians  consider to be the ""edge of hell"", a neither heaven nor hell kind of place. The sister is scared and runs away only to get lost. When the boy becomes conscious, he realizes his sister is gone, and goes out to search for her. When the brother and sister are reunited at the end, the end-game title screen shows their two dead bodies surrounded by flies."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I think he (or they) dies in a car crash. You go on to relive analogies for every stage of his life:

1. The mysterious forest representing his childhood, where everything seems strange and unknown and spiders are your biggest fears.
2. Then it's school, along with its bullies.

3. A traveling job, a lonely life of flickering motel signs.

4. Working in a factory.
5. Car crash. You get thrown around, up, down, left, right...and at the very last moment, you fly through the windshield."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"This really is a brilliant and beautiful game.  

Stating the obvious here, but in the final scene, the rope ladder is intact, suggesting the possibility of some form of ""ascent""."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"The ending seems to depict the boy, lying dead, after many years have passed, since flies buzz around his body and moss has grown on the ceiling. 

My guess: The boy and his sister had both been trapped down there for some length of time, and when he reunited with his sister after searching for her for so long, he found that all that was between her and escaping limbo was a gap between her and the ladder that was twice her height.

Her brother gave her a boost to help her escape, knowing that he could grab the ladder after her. When the young girl reached the top, Her brother grabbed onto the rope ladder, his extra weight causing the rope ladder to snap. He then, knowing there was no alternative route, let his sister go, and was left to rot.

Oh god, why did I have to realize this..."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,I thought the game was going to loop and you would work your way round to the starting screen.
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"there are a lot of interesting things about this game, and my theories are far from cohesive, but I have made certain observations that I think deserve some review. the game begins with the boy waking up in the forest, which, in a sense, could resemble the dawn of man, being that before man-made structure there were only the earth's natural environments. as you progress through the game, the environments become more and more polluted with human constructs, and little by little these constructs obscure/replace the features of the initial area. at first, there are the small, shabby, wooden villages, still surrounded by the trees of the forest, and then the more technologically advanced areas such as the iconic HOTEL setting, with the foresty features only present in the distant background, and then into the age of industry where the game has the player literally climbing all over giant gears, and then, suddenly, back into the forest. as you can see, the game escorts the player through the development of humanity, or rather, human society, and then brings them back to its origins. as for how this relates to the symbolism or whatever of the game as literature, I think it is that the player has been involved in a tragic accident, a car accident, in which he and his sister were both killed. this is why, at the end of the game, you break through a pane of glass; this represents how your character was thrown through the windshield by the force of the wreck. and they say that in the moments before you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes, right? well, take the protagonist as a character representation of all of man, and there you have it. his entire timeline, as humanity itself, flashes before his eyes, through the agrarian forests and the shanty-towns of the olden days, the cities of present and into the very heart of industry. as far as bringing the player back to the beginning, I think it is sort of a foreboding thing, a sequence trying to express that due to our technological advances and manipulation of our surroundings that we've reached the end of our civilization's cycle, and that it's high time for an ice age or some shit."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-11,"This has to be one of the most moving games I have ever played. Not only was it a well executed puzzle/platformer game, it had an incredible unspoken story to go along with it. Well worth the money spent.

I had to have a few cigarettes after playing this game... Fuck..."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"LIMBO is an utterly dark and beautiful game, and this brought back some old feels of mine. Thank you. "
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Lemme throw in my two cents on this. It's gonna be a kind of weird one.

I don't believe Limbo has a story. It's got a great atmosphere and personally, I believe that that's the main point of the game. Don't get me wrong, I loved it and it was a great and almost magical, depressing playthrough for me, but as much as I wrestled with a story, I had to admit it would be difficult to apply one that perfectly fit the entire setting. Thus, I came up with a different idea: Limbo isn't trying to send out any sort of plot points like in a normal story. This is a story of emotions and I tracked mine as I went along. For example, Nature felt like paranoia because I didn't know what I could touch before dying and all of the people I met there behaved oddly. On the other hand, I felt like the final area was more loneliness. Here we come upon a place which should be brimming with people--a hotel--and instead we're met with emptiness and left to fend off electric wires and dangerous machinery alone.

In the end, I kind of have to step back and see whatever is there as little more than an attempt to quantify subjective data, to take what little objective data we can (things meant to set the mood) and make a cohesive narrative out of it. Really it's kind of beautiful in a way, people connecting with someone who they can't even really see or know the story of. Still, the story we tell about this game seems to tell more about us than it does the little silhouette of a man running around purgatory."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"The boy built a treehouse in the forest to play with his sister. Maybe because he built it poorly they both fell and died (there are 2 corpses with flies around them and the ladder is broken in the end shot) although they don't realize they are dead until the end of the game. The boy is now in limbo, some sort of purgatory and starts looking for his sister. 

Perhaps because he is indirectly responsible for her death the path back to her is littered with dangers, trials he must go through to prove he cares about his sister before being allowed into heaven (the ladder). The game takes you through childhood fears like spiders, bullies, fear of adulthood as represented by the monstrous machines. 

When he finally reaches his sister she is waiting for him near the ladder, which isn't broken because it is the path to heaven from limbo, oblivious to her own death, trying to revive him. The boy understands what has happened and hesitates. She hears his steps and looks up. 

We cut back to the real world and there are two corpses under the tree house. The ladder is broken. 

The end."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-11,"I didn't look at Limbo as a game, but as art."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"The first time I played the game, I thought when he lands after bursting through the glass wall put him in the exact same place as in the beginning. After standing up I didn't bother to run around, and ended up taking an entirely different story away from the game -- about him stuck in Limbo -- until my second playthrough."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Anyone got any other games like this with an amazing story and different ways to interpret it. Already played limbo, bastion and to the moon."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Alternative narrative:

* Brother and Sister both die.

* Sister dies instantly, boy is taken to hospital

* Brother eventually dies in hospital, wakes up in limbo.

* Brother tries to find his way back to his sister.

* After travelling quite a distance, finally reaches his sister, which according to the title screen is where both bodies lie.

This supports the theory of why his sister is still at the original scene and the brother is not."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Would you all hate a sequel? Should they leave it as is?
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I'm probably wrong and I'm too lazy to check, but I seem to remember the title screen changing depending on where in the game you were?"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Major feels in this game. It's incredibly dark, as when you play through it seems like a purgatory inhabited by the souls of dead children; some of them are feral and violent, while others are scared and try to keep others/monsters out.

How the siblings died is a mystery, TBH I always thought they were murdered or something while outside playing, but the theory posited by the top post about their tree house collapsing sounds more likely to me."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-11,"That's what I gathered from it when I first played it. Not quite as specifically but more like:

""Brother wakes up in a type of 'puragtory'. The last thing he remembers is being with his sister, so naturally, he goes looking for her.""

Over the course of the game (and many deaths), it becomes obvious that you're dead, and likely your sister is too.

Good to know I wasn't far off. Oh, and one of my favorite games of all time."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-11,"And then when the game ends, and the brother finally finds his sister the game automatically restarts. 

I kinda thought that was a little symbolism of purgatory itself; doomed to repeat the same stuff over and over until you finally move on to the next plane of existence after being judged."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Huh, never though about it like that. The way I say it was that the brother and sister were in some sort of accident, but it didn't kill them, it put them into comas. So the game is the brother running through limbo, which I think means between life and death, to find his sister and wake up with her."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"It could also mean the rope ladder snapped on her, causing her to fall and kill her.  The boy, not being able to handle such a moment after all he went through, kills himself.

That's how I'd like to think of it anyway.  Life is sickeningly poetic and ironic, like that."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"That's it, I can't handle the theories anymore, they all seem pretty good. Someone call in the devs!"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"That's what I thought was going to happen too! 

If they did end it that way, I would've just said ""Fuck this, I can't handle this"" then curled up in the fetal position for several hours. I mean, being trapped in that hellscape for all eternity, doomed to repeat it again and again? *shudder*

As depressing as the ending is presumed to be, at least it provided closure."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Another point to add weight to this idea is that the killing of the spider and then the use of the flying bug could be seen as man's taming the beasts and domesticating food sources.

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I agree. The game was well made but I kept waiting for something to happen that would tie it all together (I mentioned Braid elsewhere in this thread, so i think my expectations for storytelling were set very high). I honestly do not think the makers concentrated on making a coherent story; the vagueness probably adds to the experience, as indicated by the numerous theories in these comments.

Having said that, some games manage to achieve great success by ways of *both* atmosphere and storytelling, namely Bioshock imho. In one of the final scenes they managed to simultaneously explain pertinent plot-points AND very eloquently break the 4th wall. Very vague, minor spoiler: [never before have i seen a linear game justify its gameplay mechanics through a plot device. I think i remember being fucked with in similar ways before only by the films The Game and Fight Club. Damn Fincher.](/spoiler)

More recently, i think Metro did story+immersion really well."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,It's not really something that would work in the context of a sequel. Part of the game is figuring out and interpreting what happened. Any additional information would ruin the game conceptually.

But it's alluded to as the movie progresses.

The main thing for me was how much it made me nostalgic about earlier 2D puzzle games like Abe's Odyssey. Not one puzzle element overstayed it's welcome. You'd get introduced to it and then you'd keep it in your arsenal for the rest of the game.

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-13,Maybe but this is just my own interpretation.
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Can't get much by you now can we?
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Perfect comment/explanation! Fucking beautiful!

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,If you play through the game the first time you should be able to beat the game in ~one hour and remembering the traps is simple. It's all about memory. Though the first time I tried it I got to the end and died 4 times there to make my total 6. I was pissed. Took me a while to try it again but I eventually got it
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-13,Same here
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-13,"Yep, that's why I said ""type of 'purgatory'"", using the word to say it's an afterlife, but not necessarily the final afterlife for these characters. ""Purgatory"" is a faster way of saying that."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"The back story is all in the novels. 

If you don't read them its exactly like Pixelbeast said."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Exactly because of that line, I thought it was speculation. Didn't expect the end-game title screen and all. Oh wells.."

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-13,there absolutely is. it's in very early production and looks pretty 3D. (I'm in the bathroom on my phone and don't care to look for it)

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I really enjoyed the story of Johnny in that, but I found Dr. Watts completely insufferable and his humor was unwelcome and really tryhard. If it wasn't for him I'd say it was a way better story."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,I still can't get into it. I tried it for a few mins and have yet to bother with it :[
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,It's a game. ( [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/) / [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Moon_(video_game))
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Though Limbo is in my library, I haven't played it yet nor seen much gameplay of it.

Don't play To The Moon for the gameplay, play it for the story, the humour, the characters, and the private jokes (oh god the private jokes, I really hope that you were born in the 90s at least)"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Good thing I bought it for the story then. And good thing that I loved it.
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"if you look at it as a simple platformer, yeah. but the story that you have to interpret for yourself makes it ever so enticing."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Lies! My first playthrough took four hours.
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"you're right, i know, shame on me. you see the thing is ... im not in elementary or middle school anymore. I would have said high school, but i didnt have much free time then either for vidya games with work and all. So not being in elementary or middle school means that my parents aren't paying for everything i own and do. Therefore i must work at a job to earn money in order to pay for everything i own and do. 

I basically have a steam library now full of games from steam sales etc, just like everyone, and i don't have time to play them all. Usually i use game time to play the games i want to the most, and limbo just hasn't been high enough on the list. I did begin playing, just never continued it. Plus, a lot of the time i just start games up to make sure they installed correctly and never play them again. I can't tell you how many games died on my desktop.

Games are just coming out too fast nowadays.. i mean hell i haven't finished a single AC either, wanna know why? Because by the time you get halfway throught the game, we already have 2 more assassins creed games out."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,I didn't finish Braid either.  I feel like I should.
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I bought Braid and Limbo at around the same time and both of them are my 2 favorite platformers.  I love the art style in both of them.

Braid is significantly more difficult than Limbo though so it took me awhile to beat it, going through months where I just gave up then randomly picking it up again."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I didn't finish it either, even after a couple of retries.

It's too hard for me. :/"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,is it bad i haven't heard of that game? :-/
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"it's been a while since i had played it, but wasn't there a big saw at the end of the game?"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Dude who made Braid masturbates to photos of himself *thinking profound stuff*. Just so you know.
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Fair enough, his phrasing just confused me a bit.

And it actually does pretty well in terms of gameplay, imo. They took great care to make sure that no gameplay element overstayed its welcome. The gravity changing, the head-bugs, the water. They all stayed as long as they were needed and then stopped."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Then try Mother 3 the final is unique.

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I think Dr. Watts was pretty key to the advancement of the story, actually. If he wasn't such an immature pest in general then the last half of the game would have been completely different, which wouldn't had made it nearly as heart-wrenching as it was. [Plus if you find Dr. Watts medicine bottle during one of the synchs it kind of fleshes him out; how he's addicted to meds and he's snarky to pretend everything's alright.] (/spoiler)"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,it's about a 4-5 hour long... amazing story. well worth it's time and money. made me very emotional.

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Makes perfect sense really, but even playing an hour a day would get you somewhere. You could complete quite a few indie games a month with an hour a day."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Why's everyone downvoting this? This is exactly how I feel, I actually rarely finish most games that I play. You know, you die and get a horrible save game checkpoint and you never touch it again. Also to blame are open world almost never ending games like TES, GTA, Saints Row, Far Cry, etc. Also some of us have jobs and are in college and junk, and when you come back to a game after working for a long time you have no idea what was going on and restarting takes way too much more time. "
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Omg, you should, even if you have to use a guide, you'll never see that ending coming... Mind blown!"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"No, it just means you need to game a little harder!"
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,What does a saw have to do with it exactly?
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Who doesn't?
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,Will do :)

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"I've never played TF2 for two reasons: 

1) I suck at team based FPSs, especially those where reaction time is critical

2) The whole hats thing sends my OCD ""must collect all the things!"" right over the edge.

14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-12,"Unless your going to provide it, yes, it is!

For many people, $500 is close to their rent, or two months of groceries! Especially, for young independent adults(22-30yrs), $500 is ALOT of money! And your giving someone shit for not dropping $500 on a computer to play a game, and act like its incomprehensible that they might find this a hardship?!?

Then you mock people for pointing out that not everyone can just drop Grants like its nothing?!? Your the worst kind of person."
14opfb,2012-12-11,2012-12-13,"Couple things:
1. Didn't demand a thing.
2. A Lot*

Strategy you can play over and over again. I can put a thousand hours into a good strategy game.

RPG is mixed. Skyrim is kind of an action game and also kind of an RPG game.

FPS often has multiplayer elements that you can enjoy all over and over again. I put a lot of time into Team Fortress 2.

I don't exactly dislike the genre, it's just the only shooter games I play are the Metroid Prime sub-series (if it counts) and Splatoon. Seeing how I prefer 2D Metroid and Splatoon is a third-person shooter, I'm not really losing much."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I like a good FPS, I really do. But it's the one that has to go. 

RPG's are simply everywhere and have worked their way into damn near everything; while action games basically went and did that from the get go. Without these two, we'd lose the vast majority of games. So those two immediately get to stay. 

Strategy games you can just... lose yourself in for days at time. New approaches, new experiences, experimentation is often rewarded. I'd also throw board games in this category.

FPS's sometimes have a solid campaign to play, but more often than not it's dropping you into the multiplayer side of gaming and that shit is just oozing toxicity far too often."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"FPS. They were fun in 2005-2012 but these days there’s so many better options and possibilities that it seems like a dated game style. The “run around and kill each other with a loose explanation for why” seems to me like an easy way to keep people buying rehashed versions of the same game every year

EDIT: I realize my timespan matches that of the 360/PS3 generation so maybe it’s just nostalgia getting in the way.

Anyway it’s especially bad with games that don’t even bother to render your lower body, as if you’re a set of arms with a gun."

All FPS games suffer from servers/connection issues to some extent. It is a 100% chance that if you play any FPS online game for 100 hours you will run into one time where you lose a fight to peekers advantage or desync causes your bullets don't register or something like that. I know every game has the same dog shit servers, but its show more in FPS games then others.

Also, ALL FPS games have cheaters. Not sure why FPS games get the worst of the cheaters, but they do and they ruin the game as much as a lot of them like to believe its not a big deal.

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Strategy. 

This was an easy one. I haven’t enjoyed a strategy game since Age of Empires II. Just going by the picture I’m assuming that’s the genre you’re going for, like a RTS kinda deal.

Yeah, not really my bag."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Damn. It has to be FPS, though RTS seems to have been on life support for a few years.

Nearly every single player game falls under both action and RPG to some degree, and I love RTS so much."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,FPS only because the story lines are usually short and they suck. The developer puts all their time and effort into the multiplayer. I'm not paying $60-$70 for that (and I don't).

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"FPS and action are technically sub-genres of RPG, so this is a 1v1. There’s strategy involved in them, too. This entire discussion is moot. Even idle games have some layer of strategy and role playing to them, despite being games that play themselves. Cookie clicker is the only type of “game” i know of that doesn’t have any strategy to it whatsoever."

Everyone loves to see some form of progression with the game, usually through getting stronger, or through progressing through a story or sequence of events.

If we were to try to remove RPG's, what exactly goes? It's such a broad category with so many beloved sub-categories. 

FPS can disappear and many other genres can go on completely unaffected. But if RPG goes, does that mean RPG elements go? No more skill trees, or equipment collection, item management or upgrading?"

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Sports are at their core alternative, safe war games. Every sport is a physical strategy battle with a win state objective that an opponent is trying to prevent you from accomplishing with their own physical being and skills. The only reason every sport doesn't involve constant murder is because no one wants to put their lives on the line, so each has rules against it.

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,What is an action game? A pitiful pile of mechanics! *hurls wine glass*
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,I’d say things like Just Cause or Assassins Creed. Third person games that feel like they’re written as action movies. Pretty much anything from Naughty Dog.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"You know, this is the only right answer"

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,I really want to like to FPS. I just really don’t.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Same here!
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Same
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Nah there are so many games that are classified into action that it’s irreplaceable. The fps genre doesn’t exist outside the action genre and a lot of rpgs and strategy games fall into it as well. I’d have to toss FPS
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,The salty fan base too

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I wouldn't be so quick, because while there is the generic shit that u see in the surface, once u look closely there are a lot of unique hidden gems(out something not so hidden) like with doom eternal, and ultrakill if your into fast paced shooters, and it ur not into those, I'm sure if u look closely u could find something also unique and interesting in other areas of the genre"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,*Cries in Doom*
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"OFC not. FPS games are automatically material for squeaky-voiced 12 years old who regularly attend to your mother's sexual needs.

Meanwhile -- Bioshock, FEAR, Superhot, Metro, Half Life, STALKER, Doom, and the list of amazing games goes on. Not to mention how Call of Duty games actually used to be amazing before this bandwagon started rolling.

Oh, and let's totally forget that FPS must have driven technological innovation -- to the point of actually pushing the *hardware* industry forward -- more than any other genre. Name a modern real-time rendering technique and John Carmack probably had something to do with it."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Yea we know.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"We do, but other opinions are better"

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I am fully aware of that. Not a hater of FPS, but I kinda feel bad because I have some EXTREME motion sickness and that makes me physically unable to last playing FPS games. So yeah, to me, FPS has to go"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Mobas should stay for as long as they can. We don't want the toxic lol community in our online games.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,I feel this. Strategy takes a lot of brains which i don't enjoy in games. I'd rather have small mind play and a lot of shooting heads.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Yeah, that's how I feel


The others are just more enjoyable for me"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Same, and it always seems crazy to me that there are people who will just entirely rule out a genre because of one bad experience. That is why I picked action, because action is often included in rpg and fps anyway so I'm not losing any variety by letting that one go"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Idk man, Titan Fall 2 is one of my favorite games of all time"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,what about all the vr games that have guns

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-30,The genre sucks because of the popularization of FPS on consoles mostly.

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Prob just suck
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"The funny thing here is that people bash FPS games for being repackaged and reheated yesterday's dinner, but pretty much the same thing has been happening with RPGs for an even longer time. I hear RPG, and my mind immediately jumps to magic, sorcery, dragons, inventory management and character builds. Occasionally it's the same formula, but in space. Sure, some games break the mold, but not nearly enough to justify the hypocrisy."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Not everything is doom
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,What about action? Can't think of any relevant games with action as their main genre. Most of them fall under RPG or FPS primarily (e.g. GTA or DOOM). Maybe Just Cause is Action but I don't think that's worth keeping over the other three genres. Genuinely interested which games you're thinking of.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"You want halo... Doom, cod, and literally half the modern popular games to go?"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Your forgetting all the older gems or singleplayer only games like metro, doom, far cry, fallout and elder scrolls"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Oh yea, tons of people in their 60s and 70s. Eyeroll"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"It's a genre as it limits what you would be doing normally, in favor of a fun pace.

I cant really think of an FPS that wouldnt be considered an action game."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Yeah really surprised most people here vote for FPS. Even Survival-Games such as DayZ, Minecraft or something like No Man's Sky feels much more immersive to me if played in First Person. Also played Red Dead 2 fully in First Person and after Apex standardized First Person in Battle Royale I don't want to go back to third person Fortnite or PUBG."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,But you realize that fps isn't just limited to online shooters right?
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"This just in, FPS games are terrible when you judge them as if they were a singleplayer story game"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"So, goodbye to the original 2 Fallout games"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,All fps aren't multiplayer online competitive games

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I feel like that only applies to FPS games with multiplayer as their main focus and story as the side focus or no focus at all. And I really don’t think there’s a problem with that when there’s games that don’t do that.

DOOM, Far Cry, Fallout, Half-Life, and Metro come to mind as FPS games with great stories and good length.

And I’m counting Portal as FPS, and I’ll die on that hill. You have a gun that makes holes."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"It's because FPS is the most narrow genre by far. Strategy is an entire encompassing genre that has Tactical Strategy, Grand Strategy, Real-Time Strategy, Puzzle Strategy, Card Strategy etc... FPS by comparison is a sub-grenre (first-person) of a sub-genre (shooter), and while there's many phenomenal FPS games, the overall loss would be lesser. There would still at least be other shooters, as well as other first-person games."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Fps is just action where you can’t see yourself. It’s the most redundant option here.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I think there is a stigma for those who play fps and the rest of the genres.  Most fps are shells of there former self and a part of fps is to lose a lot... mostly out of your control so it becomes a very toxic environment where were not just mad at everyone in the lobby but any gamer that just plays ""action"" games aren't ""good enough"" to play fps.  On the opposite side sits a bunch of gamers with different interests and lack of time who would generlize most fps gamers as toxic. My point, I think that's why fps is on the ""count block"""

It’s not adventure, you’re not really exploring.

It’s an action move stuck into a video game instead. They don’t make very much sense and are really just an excuse to do cool shit. 

I’d put the more recent Far Cry entries in there too, the earlier ones are more Adventure-y"

Cause multiplayer games can be always pretty toxic but I would honestly say that some singleplayer fps games have easily one of my favorite campaigns and I would also argue, a few of the best stories:

Star Wars: Republic Commando, Halo Reach, Halo 2,  Dishonored, Bioshock, Bioshock Infinte, Far Cry 3, Titanfall 2, Metro series and Doom Eternal etc.

They all are extremly unique in gameplay and have a complete different way to play them, unlike multiplayer games which are about nothing else but shooting... and... shooting harder... People generalize them here but you could do the same with any other genre. The difference between the mentioned games can be as big as between Witcher and AC4. Just because they are open world games with swords as weapons, it doesn't mean that they are the same. Seriously."

My advice is to try survival games if you want the best exploration experience, not only is the scenery usually beautiful but you also feel like you've earned that scenic landscape you spent ages travelling and surviving to go see"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,I mean surely you can just do that just slap some skills and just go exloring no? Or do you mean you feel pressured that you have to have a min max build otherwise you not going to get far?

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Oh my sweet summer child, let me tell you about a game called Path of Exile. Where the term Fire applies separately to (Fire attacks, Fire Spells, Ignite, Burning )and modifiers on equipment consist of “x to Fire dmg, x to Fire spells, x to Fire dot multi, % increased Fire, More Fire, physical to Fire etc”. 

A full build character has 133 passive tree points and the entire tree has over 1k options to choose not including building add ons to your own tree through special dropped items. Played around 1k hours in game and a hundred hours researching terms/guides and still feel like a total noob. A “casual player” in POE is essentially a hardcore player in most games and you are considered behind the curve if you haven’t played at least 40 hours in the first two weeks of a new league (game resets everyone to 0 currency/character every new 3 months when a new expansion comes out). Even the devs are cracked, releasing entire expansions every 3 months that include balancing hundreds of skills, creating new skills, items and a new game play mechanic tied around the league title."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Always wondered why games are not designed this way:
If you use weapon type A you get better at A. 

For example if I start to play with one handed weapons then my hero becomes better at them. If they were swords in particular maybe he starts to swing them faster. If I use dual swords and light attack - he progressivly unlocks different styles of attack that are better. And so on, you get the idea.

I just cannot comprehend the point system - ""I leveled up by fishing so now I can be better at smithing"" ."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Almost every online multiplayer game has that element to it because that's human nature when mixed with anonymity. Multiplayer games are awesome, but they're awesome when played with friends, in the same room or at a LAN party where you can all play and laugh together, giving each other shit in a friendly and funny way. Online play with randoms is a cheap substitute where you play vs. human bots, with more randomness to their actions but far more shitty behavior as a side effect.

This is the primary reason I don't play online FPS or MMO games even though I love plenty of the game concepts. I play games to have fun, and if I can't multiplayer with my friends, I'll rather just play solo.

Strategy games seems to be somewhat exempt from this rule, because little dumb shits who ""fucked your mom last night"" can't just get good at these games by throwing more free time at it, and they seldom have the patience for a full game of Civ."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Thats because most ""sport"" games are ""strategy"" games think the football or basketball or soccer games. Those are just types of ""strategy"" games, can't define them as action, most of it is controlling multiple characters, developing teams, etc. I bet whoever likes sport games can get into strategy games and vice versa if they get past their prejudices of the theme of play. Most racing games would be closer to action, games you control a single character with a lot of andrenaline filled situations requiring your direct input. 

I think instead of sports we should have included a moba or somethinf category. A mix of action and strategy."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"And it allows you to replay the game over and over, learning new skills you didn't use the last time you played the game!"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"While u/kinokomushroom only mentioned skill trees, menus and item upgrades, I'm gonna use crafting as an example because that is also antithetical to the ""mindlessly explore and do some cool shit"" credo. 

There's a reward-risk you have to take when utilizing a crafting system in a game. In my experience, all crafting systems builds upon the foundation that your character has an inventory, i.e. what you craft *replaces* something that you already have for something else. It never adds stuff to what you already have.

Take Witcher 3 for example. You might get a blueprint for an awesome sword early on, but you need materials to craft it. You basically know the stats for the sword, but now you either spend time mindlessly farming the materials which feels like a chore, or you just continue questing until you get what you need by chance. But during that time you'll most likely get newer swords from normal gameplay, diminishing the stat upgrade the sword would have been compare to when you got the blueprint, or you might even have found a better sword along the way, potentially making the time farming wasted effort. 

In contrast to metroidvanias (meaning the OG metroidvanias like Metroid games, Hollow Knight, Ori), which is my favorite genre and having exploration and doing cool shit as core concepts, there are no such reward-risks. Character upgrades are additive, only making you stronger, often substantially so. You acquire upgrades by stumbling upon them rather than actively working towards getting something. Thus there's never a sense of anticipation that gets ruined by disappointment. 

There's also arguments against skill trees and items and other things, but crafting is my least favorite mechanic."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"It just feels so cluttered imo. Whenever you kill an enemy or search some location, you get so many different stuff such as items, XP, skill points, upgrade points, in-game currency, crafting recipes, and some documents filled with lore. I feel pressured to go into the menu and read the info about whatever I just picked up or look at the skill tree to see what new skills I can upgrade. Also stresses me having to choose which skill/upgrade to get next because it feels like having to decide what to purchase next. I just want something simple and straightforward.

Maybe it's just me who's like that though, a lot of other people might be just fine with these mechanics."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I def feel the pressure to do the upgrades right, I feel that if I do not there is going to be a huge time penalty waiting for me further on down the road by having to grind way harder later on because I upgraded the wrong things."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I mean, tbh, those two skills are things nobody wants to actually spend time doing for the most part..."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"There have been games designed that way.  Skyrim levels exactly that way where the more you blacksmith, the higher your blacksmith skill goes. The more you use one handed weapons, the higher it goes.

The problem is that people end up trying to level by just spamming the same thing over and over and over.  You get people crafting tons of daggers, or backstabbing npcs over and over and over.  Many people find leveling by accomplishing actual tasks, whether that be killing monsters or finishing quests, to be much more satisfying."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I mean, DMC 5 was released in 2019 Bayonetta 3 had a gameplay trailer last month. And is yet to be released, and Dark souls is still VERY MUCH on the radar seeing as Elden Ring. 

So pretty recent. Not even to mention Hades, Breath of the Wild etc etc"

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,I apologize for my behaviour. It was never my intention to disrespect the great Gabe. May he bless the upcoming sales and bring us discounts touched by the golden light of affordable prices. Amen.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I agree. So many games have crafting nowadays but if it's not done right, it just becomes more chore to do and often leads to disappointment because you can find better items by looting. Also it adds so many items to the game and inventory management becomes something you have to do regularly too.

I do love metroidvanias too, maybe they're just more my type of games haha. Maybe I just like more linear games than open world games, but I do love games like Breath of the Wilds, Subnautica, and Death Stranding. I had a lot of fun playing those games, and the world felt something special that needs to be explored."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Play darksouls
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Probably. I've never met anyone that disliked the stuff you do. Nothing wrong with it though. Personally I love all the shit you mentioned.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I see what you mean. I like that there are skill trees to make your character feel like your own. But even then there is a limit how much I like for example I wouldn't dare to even think about touching [Path Of Exile](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pathofexile_gamepedia/images/3/33/PoE-SkillTree-33.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20180718215014) skill tree (link is picture of the tree). I do too have anxiety about the skill trees, and usually what I do is that I research the game beforehand and decide my build before playing the game."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"I agree that most RPG’s need to dramatically cut back on the useless shit it throws at you. Make loot rarer but more valuable/meaningful. Single player RPG’s with MMO like loot mechanics is dumb.

Playing inventory management is just a drag."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"THEN WHY PUT THEM IN THE FUCKING GAME!?!

sorry not upset at you this is just a pet peeve on my part, devs putting in elaborate fishing and cooking and shit in an action game like if I'm gonna fish, cook, sleep, fuck, or anything else easily accessible in real life, I'm not going to waste my time doing it in a fucking game where i can't even taste the steak I just cooked up, or feel the pull of the rod when the fish bites. Its just such a weird concept to me that these are in games, do people actually enjoy doing these things in game?"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,LOL i guess. If the Japanese say that than they are right. So many times i was carried by a senpai in this game :)
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Yeah I mean there can be variations. Like horror action (Last of Us) stealth action (Metal Gear) or action adventure (Uncharted), but I still think it’s a fairly clearly identifiable genre."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"The way I see action is that there is player combat involved. Both FPS and RPG games I would consider action. Strategy games like AOE2 or Starcraft2 could definitely also have arguments as an action game though would definitely be pushing it.

Imo games fall into either Action, Puzzle, Sport or Sandbox-style."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Same. Been playing on my free time for 6 months. Breezed my way to gold then get my ass whooped. I purposely lost 10 games in a row to drop to mid silver so it’s fun again
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Is there a thing with replying to similar looking avatars I’m unaware of?
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Yeah never. I just hate fortnite because it's such a terrible shooter even though it's pretty genius and very fun actually. But the truth is way more can happen in that game than can happen in most shooters or games. 

You play the same map 100 times something different is going to happen every time. It's a great game."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"It's a great game, the people who hate on it are the same nerds who will hate on anything mainstream. I'm sure it has plenty of flaws but it's free to play and consistently updated"

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Very good.  You are forgiven.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"As someone who loves souls games and played the shit out of dks2 and dks3, the games have a lot of the stuff OP doesn't like. The stats are confusing and mean nothing to new players, plus you get a ton of useless gear in your playthrough just by exploring. Very good games but they fall into that group with bloated stat trees and confusing mechanics"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,Holy shit that skill tree is a full time job.
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Agreed, my dude. If you play enough games you can recognize an ""action-____"" game from a fps or RPG pretty easily, typically."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"if there is, im also unaware of it"
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Basically this. I stopped around season 9 chapter 1, and it didn’t take me long to realise that despite all of the minor changes to the map, I’ve been playing the same game on the same map for a long time. Playing with friends is cool but the novelty of that wears off pretty quickly as well."
qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,"Terrible shooter-wise and I personally dislike how combat revolves into build, shoot, build shotgun. The better builder wins 90 percent of the time. Different strokes for different folks though."

qi0dx6,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,That's certainly true. I don't think shotgun is a bad weapon to have your game focused around though. It's certainly better than AR imho.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Pitfall on Atari or Prince of Persia (played on MacIntosh II) I think did this.  I don't remember exactly.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Mega Man X had extra lives in some stages if you went left right away. If I remember right, there was even one that had a suit capsule."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,The first game to do this was the atari 2600 game called Pitfall.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I remember Donkey Kong Country on SNES doing that, there was a hut you jump out of (scripted) to start level 1, and if you jump back up in there you can find a... spare life? crap it's been too long, but I think it was a red balloon (spare life)"

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Atari Football. You could go backwards and come out the other side of the screen and tackle the cpu player easily.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Metroid and Castlevania both do this
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Pitfall did this, when you start if you go one direction its hard mode, if you go the other direction its easy mode."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Far Cry 4. By following the instructions and waiting you finish the game before it starts.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,For me it was Metroid
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"The earliest one I can name is the original Metroid. I didn't just reward you for going left, it required it in order to progress, thereby immediately teaching you that this isn't a game in which you just go right and kill whatever you find there."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Lot of games did it before it, but I feel like Crash Bandicoot was the series that really instilled in a generation to not trust where you start."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Donkey Kong country? Bananas and a life balloon I think?
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Probably Donkey Kong Country.  Not only did yoy get an extra life by going into the house, but then later on you got to effectively skip on of the harder cart levels in the 3rd (maybe 2nd) world."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Metroid comes to mind obviously.

But there was also a level in Armored Core where from the start of it, you turn around, jump behind a box, and there's a hidden item that is practically best in it's class for a long while and the only way to get it."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Raymond legends on some level
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Prince of Persia could skip most of the first level
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Metroid, the fact you went left to get the first power up was a new thing, in fact, the reason the first power up is left, is to teach the player they need to go both directions."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Definitely not the first (and not technically backwards), but I love that in the first mine cart level of DK Country, you can suicide off the very first ledge and hit a barrel that skips the entire level.

I also love that level, so I don’t always use it. Still love this trick though."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Apparently in ready player 1, they had an entire internet game culture to hunt for this secret, but nobody bothers to drive backwards on a popular race....

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Pretty sure if you went backwards in Pitfall, you just beat the game. It's been a long time since I played Pitfall on my C64, so my memory might be spotty."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Pitfall and the clones always had a left.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Pretty sure it was Metroid.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Riddle of the Sphinx on the Atari 2600 had something similar. It was a vertical scroller, but if you went down at the beginning you could get some item at a pyramid."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Donkey Kong Country also did something like this.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,It is Mario.. secret path above the level
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Prince of Persia. On some of the levels you start facing a way but the correct path was to run backwards. Thats the first instance I can think of.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Some levels in the Donkey Kong Country series on SNES have secret areas or items if you go left.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,there was a point-and-click where you get off a train into a western town and you can immediately get back on it and end the game

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I'm sure you could do this on one of the first Sonic games like 2nd level or something

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Gotta be Metroid right? That was really early on
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Metroid?
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenStartBonus

Definitely Metroid."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"It is quite famously the first Metroid game on NES. It's a wonderful case of conveyance by showing rather than telling, as the player can only progress so far to the right before hitting a dead end without the morph ball, forcing them to backtrack to the left and thereby introducing the concept of the entire game within about 30 seconds."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Not as old but I vaguely remember having a demo of James pond that had a timer on it so you could only play a few minutes of what was the full game. If you went left right at the start you could break the timer and it gave you the full game.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"This is why I can’t enjoy games anymore.  I know the path I’m *supposed to* take, but all I do is immediately turn around check every wall, check everything and then there is nothing and I’m just a disoriented blob of disappointment.  I tell myself, just go forward on the path, but “no! I’ll miss something!”  And my game playing fell.

I blame collectibles and achievements.  Utter garbage."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Atari 2600: Riddle of the Sphinx is the first I remember. The game is played scrolling up, but you find out for a puzzle that there's something important if you scroll down first."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I think that asshole place that you have to duck forever randomly to move forward was off to the left in Castlevania II.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Donkey Kong for the SNES was a great example. Many of the levels had secrets right at the beginning.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Donkey Kong Land on the GameBoy!  
On a few levels, where you start you are facing right, the direction to move; there's almost no visual incentive to see anything on the left whilst facing right, that is until you *look* left. If you did, you now see the camera shift to see more of the left-hand portion of the screen. On most levels there's nothing, but on a few you may see areas to walk to, and on occasion you may find an item or a secret!

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Check on TVtropes. Doom 1 iirc gave you the chainsaw early if you went backwards.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-22,"errr.....big rigs over the road racing? driving backwards would allow you to literally acelerate to the speed of light, as well as instantly ""win"" the ""race"" complete with ""you are winner"", as the game was unable to tell if you drove the entire course, or drove 5 ft then reversed back over the starting line."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"This definitely seems like the most likely answer so far.

So many games pay homage to it these days.

I wonder if anything did it before that?"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I feel like I saw a YouTube video referencing this exact thing, and how they designed the start specifically so that you dead ended quickly when moving straight to the right and HAD to backtrack since they had to tell their players how to play the game in this new way"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"While this answer isn't wrong, I feel like Metroidvanias are overall a different beast than a typical side-scroller platformer.  OP's original post had me thinking about games where the objective of each level is to reach the end of the level.  Metroid doesn't really have 'levels' it's just one large world that you continue to explore left, right, up, and down throughout the entire experience.  Meanwhile, a game where the objective is to reach the goal at the far right side of the map over and over again just feels far more jarring when something is off to the left at the beginning of any given level."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I remember playing this when it game out, and I was completely shocked at the time... now I go left at the start of every side-scroller just in case. That's a real lasting impact of one simple design decision."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Don’t you go left at the start of Zelda two
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"So far, that's older that the ones I can think of.   So maybe it is."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"This was my immediate thought, the way the game works basically requires you to pick a random direction and keep going until you progress or hit a dead end. If it's your first time you basically go over every square inch of the map trying to figure out how to progress."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I immediately went ""no. I know some Amstrad games that had that first. Dizzy was clearly earlier than Metroid and you went left""

I was half right. You definitely travel left at the start.
But how the hell was it created a year AFTER Metroid?"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I know metroid was earlier but donkey king on snes was the first one I remember doing it.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Yeah I feel like Metroid or Blaster Master? Not sure which came first
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I remember being so confused when I first started and you ran into that wall with a hole you were too big for. I remember quitting and going back to it just to find I had to go the other way.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,You made me unlock that memory. I completely forgot about this game till now. Thank you for bringing it up.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Don’t forget “Athletic Land”.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,This is the correct answer. First example was Pitfall.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Is there a winning route when you go left to gather treasure though? I thought one of the only routes was already super tight.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Also the second (maybe third) level has a cave to the left you can jump above to a barrel that either sends you to a bonus area or rockets you across the level.

I think there may be more levels with that as well."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Also in Donkey Kong Country 2 in the rollercoaster level.  If you go backwards when the level starts, you get a boost barrel which lets you get a bit of a head start in the race."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,">Donkey Kong Country,

1994..."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Several of the cave area levels as well. Actually, lots of examples of this in DKC"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I had just commented elsewhere that this game taught you to go left for every single start of a stage, and that DKC2 is 200% worse about it"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I remember this being mind blowing
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Happens in Donkey Kong 64 too
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"2 weeks later, Mega Man X2 released and on the (grass vine) robot stage, there's a free and easy heart container to the left."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I tried to introduce my kids to this (8 & 11) after spending money so they could play classic SNES games and my 8 year old told me at dinner that there is a new one and they don’t really like the “old fashioned” games.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Thats the first one i knew about as a kid
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"listen here, youngin'"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Doom 2 specifically, but yes, this is my answer as well."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"And by having you drop down off a ledge as soon as you step forward from the starting point, the level design gives you exactly one chance to get it."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"And wheb you think about it in this era - it is so obvious. Yet, as a kid, i never discovered it until somebody told me.

Just too busy going forward!"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Yeah but also idkfa
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"That's in doom2, not the original doom."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Backward round the whole track to try to ram the winners.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Given that entries were limited/hard-to-get (I think the race only ran once a week?) and the prize for winning seemed highly valuable it’s somewhat more believable that most people wouldn’t randomly dick around like that.  Although after a bunch of runs when it seemed impossible to finish normally, you’d think people would be looking for shortcuts/tricks/Easter eggs/etc."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"What was wrong with the three from the book? The lich thing was awesome, playing a movie like guitar hero or karaoke was super original, and Zork is a super iconic game."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"There's a lot they dumbed down from the book.  The original first challenge was a game of Joust.  Which I could have sworn was in advertising for the film, but not in the film..."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"It was something else in the book. I don’t remember, like a puzzle hidden in a school or something?

Spielberg thought it would be more cinematic to have a race with King Kong or something."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"The dumbest thing about that movie was that millions of gamers wouldn't find any of the easter eggs. It just got *dumber* when they were as simplistic as ""drive backwards"", but honestly they could be absurdly complex and gamers would still figure it out.

And that's the dumbest thing in a movie *absolutely filled* with dumb things. Really shattered my illusion of spielberg if i'm being honest. Dude has completely lost touch."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I thought the exact same thing. Theres always somebody there not to race but to just screw around
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Ready player one had horrible writing, never saw the movie but I'll never understand the popularity of the book.   It's writing is so bad"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"That whole book is a poorly written plot hole. Cline has a serious “and then” habit and I would be shocked to learn he’s ever had a conversation with someone of the opposite sex with the way he writes women. 

The movie is somehow worse. The big street fight where people are just running around in public makes me laugh."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"The book/movie was aimed for nostalgia rather than logic and this was just another reference to the 70s/ 80s/90s. when you see them drive backwards, it’s suppose to make you think of when you first did that in a video game as a kid, not to think nobody in the movie's reality has played videogames before.

kinda like the first time you enter the Konami code."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I'll be that guy; I saw the movie before I read the book and halfway through I decided the movie was better. (That whole WarGames shit is exactly what ignorant people *think* nerd culture is.)
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Ever since Donkey Kong country I start basically every platformer level just *checking* if there's anything cool to the left
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"That's a pet peeve of mine, too. Feels like the guy who wrote it doesn't know about speedrunners, because they break games open six ways from Sunday with absolutely wild strategies that would have had that riddle solved within a month."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"If finding the Easter eggs would make me the richest person on the planet, you’re damn right I’m going to drive backwards. 

My biggest gripe with the movie is that the main character started already established and not a poor nobody."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"If
You die don’t you lose all of your money?"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I will say that a reason why no one did it before was that there was a wall. Someone mention to that it was a weekly event and no one had won it before making it easy to think that winning the race was the answer.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Cool sequence in the film, makes sense why they went with it. In the book the first egg is done waaaay differently, but it would be insanely boring in a movie, as most of it is about the failures that happened, how people came up with methods to find eggs, the groups that were made because of this, and the famous hunters who become the main characters. Plus it’s Joust, which isn’t as exciting as a big ass explodey race."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,My friend had a nascar game and when i would get bored I would race backwards and crash into him head on.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"I had the game NASCAR 2001 for the N64, I don’t think I ever completed a race forwards"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"The maximum amount of time that would have stayed secret is however long it took to start the second race, and it probably would have been found on accident during the first race."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Nascar games 👌🏽👌🏽
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,That's when I knew this was a film written and made by non-gamers.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,It is hella fun to do tbf.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"To be fair, that’s an A to B race, and not a loop. There was literally nothing behind them but a wall."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"We had an Indy car style racer called Racin' Force in our student center in college circa 1995.  We got real competitive putting our names on the hall of fame screen.  One day messing around, I drove backwards from the starting grid.  I figured out the lap timer didnt start until you crossed the start/finish line.  If you went backwards a ways, you could be up to full speed when the time started.  Had my initials on the entire leaderboard for a couple of weeks before I let everyone in on the secret."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Big memory unlocked here! Thank you!
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"It's not oftenni encounter a waterfall in real life, and the chances there are even less than in a video game.  But when I have, I have always checked.  Just in case.

No luck so far.  One had kind of a cool cave area but no loot.  But I'll always check."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I don’t understand why even include a waterfall if they don’t have loot behind it. Who is designing these levels?
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Third time they held the race you'd have half a dozen people on the start line just ramming each other and eventually someone would have been knocked backwards and oh shit look what i found!
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"No one was as super smart as Wade, though! /s"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"accidentally, too, i bet"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Honestly, and maybe I am wrong, but I can kind of hand-wave this plothole away. Consider that perhaps what the prize was created the idea that it would be insanely difficult to complete it. Unless players were inherently given a reason to think that the race was actually impossible to complete the normal way, then the plausibility that it could be completed would keep people focused on finding out how to get past the obstacle that seemed to be beatable but just not beaten yet.

Eventually, people would kind of just stop trying as perhaps they lost the belief that such a thing actually existed and it was just a hoax of some kind. It wasn't like 100% of the people in the game had been spending hours upon hours trying to complete the race. And for those that kept trying, they just grinded currency to try and improve to get past that one part of the race that didn't seem impossible, just extremely difficult but still beatable.

I dunno, maybe I am giving too much benefit of the doubt or just trying to suspend too much disbelief? Just think about how long it took people to realize the camera-flash in Punch-Out was an indicator for when to punch to stop the first Bald Bull's rush? If that ""secret,"" which was right in everyone's face, took until 2009 to be discovered, then maybe it isn't a stretch that no one would drive backwards in a race? And as far as I have experienced, no racing game has ever had an easter egg from driving backwards at the start of a race, especially when racing against other players.

Not to mention that there are consequences to losing in the race: you lost all your currency and gear. It would be a hard ask for someone to, instead of trying to beat and win the race (meaning not only did you have to get past all the obstacles, but also be the first to the finish line), going off and doing something else and lose all your currency/gear for nothing.

Just some thoughts.

Edit: Adding more as I am remembering the scene and the words for the clue. First, I don't remember if it was 5 years since someone discovered the race was where the first key was found or if it was 5 years since the clues were released. If the latter, then it's possible it took some time before someone figured out that the first key had to do with the race. Now, the driving backwards part. It wasn't just about exploring backwards. Perhaps people did forgo the race and explore behind the starting line. But that wasn't what accessed the secret path. It was committing to driving backwards, pedal to the metal, towards a seeming impassable concrete wall (presumably the wall wouldn't let you pass through unless you met certain criteria, like actually driving backwards and going full throttle). I think with these, and some of the these I mentioned above, there is enough to suspend disbelief and not let it take away from the movie."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Oh no, I’m about to be that guy….

….the book was so much better!

I’m sorry."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Don't watch any isekai anime.. they can all be destroyed by this logic
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,There’s definitely backtracking required in those games but not a “go in a not-obvious direction right at the start of the game” situation.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"If I remember right, the original Zork published by Personal Software (makers of Visicalc) started you in front of a house next to the mailbox.  I think you could get something from the forest but soon had to return to the house to start your adventure."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Thank you, I knew there was an NES game that did this."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I knew this had to be here if I scrolled far enough!
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Totally what I was thinking. You got a life for making him wear the Mickey Mouse ears hanging from the clothesline.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"So glad to see this, was scrolling through just to see if anyone else played that game back in the day. Great game!"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Came looking for this. Immediately at game start, turn left and attack the wall to reveal a secret pickup.

Interestingly the novel READY PLAYER ONE (not the movie!) has a whole chapter on BLACK TIGER - and the author does not mention this trick, the very first thing any expert player of the game would do. I lost respect for the book around that point."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"I remember that one. First one me and my best buddy found. We got every achievement except the last one where you had to play through the whole game in one sitting without dying. We tried and tried and we put hundreds if not thousands of hours into trying to do it. We had most of the game down pat. It was usually just a stupid ""we were too high and jumped too soon"" that stopped us. We even made it to that very last jump once and I was too nervous so I let him do it and he messed it up. That hurt more than the cake being a lie

Anyways that was on the 360 back in the day. I have it on my modern Xbox (actually bought it years ago on an Xbox One) now but they've changed it to finishing the game in one sitting with five deaths or less. I could do that easily but it wouldn't feel right after my buddy killed himself. I've got every other achievement but I just can't bring myself to get that last one. Especially with the five deaths change it would just feel like cheating

Thanks for mentioning it. I'm all warm and fuzzy with treasured memories now that I don't dig up much these days"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"My first thought. Run left, jump up on the cliff formation and jump up to have a 1-up fall down."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Yep you had to climb the wall to the invisible chamber
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Excellent soundtrack too.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Exactly what I thought too - and if you grabbed the five items in an order that spelled ""CHEAT"" (or something similar) you got a bunch of extra lives or other powers ups (my memory is hazy on the details here)"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I don’t have many opportunities to say this but…I *loved* my Atari.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Yes! I remember this.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"To skip the cart level you hit the barrel off screen after the first ledge. 

I think you're thinking of the Stop & Go Station where when you first enter the level and immediately go back to the entrance of the level, it brings you to the end of the level."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Doom 2 was released earlier the same year, and it gives you the chainsaw if you go backwards at the start.

It's also interesting that there is a ledge right at the start, so if you start by going forward a bit, you cannot get the chainsaw."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,Mario 3 you could go backwards. I think even Mario 2 you could.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Donkey Kong Country on SNES, too."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-22,This right here is the real answer :D
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Hold my beer kids let an old guy weigh in. 

The first game I remember doing this was Pitfall in 1982."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I was thinking Commander Keen but looks like metroid came first
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,i seem to recall the first donkey kong on ~~n64~~  snes did this as well.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,There’s a reason those games that reward you for going back later after getting more skills are called MetroidVanias
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Yeah Metroid is definitely the definitive answer but I also have a gut feeling there's something else out there.. though the creators of Metroid might not have known about it if there is.  

Probably something in a text based adventure game like Zork or some obscure game like Pharaoh's Curse"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I'm pretty sure Doom did. Maybe it was wolfenstein?
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,There are probably a hundred videos on Youtube about that. It's what everyone immediately talks about when they want to talk about game design in the original Metroid.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Fair enough. 

And now that there’s enough in the Metroidvania genre it is to be expected. 

But when the first Metroid came out, though?

People had been playing Super Mario Bros and Sonic and the like, and it looked (at first glance) like it was just another one like those… but in **Space!**. 

Suddenly realizing that, No, you **don’t** just ‘Move Right to Win’? That you can go **anywhere**, and even **need** to back track to progress?

That was kind of mindblowing."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,The fact that Metroid made not going right a thing so definitive that it spun off a new genre doesn't preclude it from being the first game that rewarded going left at the start
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,">While this answer isn't wrong, I feel like Metroidvanias are overall a different beast than a typical side-scroller platformer.  OP's original post had me thinking about games where the objective of each level is to reach the end of the level.

Which is *exactly* why it was so groundbreaking in the first Metroid. It singlehandedly created a new subgenre of games."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,donkey kong on snes had a secret area at the left of start
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Same here. It's instinct. Not only in side scrollers. In FPS games as well i always check the starting area because of this moment.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Zelda 2 starts you off inside a castle with a sleeping princess in the background. Whether you go left or right, you hit the edge of the screen and get taken into the overworld."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Correct,  but nobody knew that playing for the first time.

That's how they introduced you to the idea of scrolling left and right, since that's the basis for the entire game."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Yes, it is."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"The left path was easier, so it felt like a bonus if your main objective was staying alive as long as possible. We passed the controller after deaths."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Most guides that have you get all the treasures have you start by going left. I agree though that this likely was not an intended reward by the developers but part of the gameplay dynamic.

There are 128 screens, going left or right above ground increments the screen number by 1, while doing so underground increments the screen number by 3. The first screen will let you go in any direction except underground to the right to start."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"There's actually a ton of built in full level skips in the three DKC games. I knew of two of them from just the first game, but recently watched a 101% full clear of the game, and they utilize like 8 at least. 

I know of two in DKC 3, but can't recall any in DKC 2."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,you just gave me flashbacks to playing GT as a kid and doing exactly that to the bots out of boredom. i havent thought about that for the better part of 20 years.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"I went to the St. Louis science museum in the summer of 1994, and for whatever reason, they had a huge Dayton USA cabinet (it was weeks old at the time) running on a big screen. There was, predictably, a huge line to play, but my cousin and I waited and watched a zillion kids play Daytona USA. When I was my turn, I immediately turned the car around and started driving backwards around the track, smashing into the other cars. I feel like it still gave me credit for completing the laps, though? Anyway, it was a big hit among the other 8-to-14-year-old kids there."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"This is how I would play carmaggedon
 Wrack all the points and destroy all the cars this way"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Yeah but even some random troll who knew they'd never win would have done it at least once in 5 years, which is where the movie picks up."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Yeah it would be believable if only a couple of races had happened, but it had been years at that point and not a single person thought to drive backwards? It seemed like everyone was driving only on the road instead of trying to look for some sort of shortcut or some other way to win."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"The game also felt winnable (almost) when played the right way.  It just seemed super difficult, which is what you'd expect."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"The first dozen or so races I can see everyone just going for it, but after that there would be a mix of the better drivers trying to get even better while less skilled drivers would be covering every inch of the track looking for a hidden powerup or something and that would absolutely include going backwards."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"I get that things have to be different to work in a visual medium, but I will say that while the book isn't The Great American Novel [tm], narratively it works a lot better, particularly for why the first challenge basically never got found.

(Also, downside to Spielberg directing it is he was (understandably) reluctant to put in a bunch of stuff related to *his* movies.)"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,The movie was... A bit different from the book
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,My best guess is that getting the rights to anything d&d related would have probably cost a fortune so they went in a completely different direction for the first. But I have no honest idea.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Not a lot of that would translate over to a fun cinematic experience for most viewers. Plus in the book, it took place over a much longer time period than in the film, so there was more development to play with.  

I think the film was a solid adaptation, all things considered."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"As much as I agree, the book is great and the movie is terrible. Having said that most of those great scenes in the book would not translate to the screen, at all. My brother and I talked a lot about that when the book came out and what a terrible movie it would make if they tried to adapt it near 1:1. Turns out it was a fucking terrible movie they couldn’t adapt well even loosely."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Well, the book was kind of bad. Amd the writers of the movie only skimmed it from what I can tell."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Some More News talks about the ending, that instead of addressing any of the inequality and squalor, the masses are deprived of some of their escape and the hero gets wealthy or something?

Which is the dystopian ending to a Black Mirror episode."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Yes, but it is a fun, easy read with a lot of rememberries. It's just fast food"

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,From the film it looked like you still had to stay on the track while going backwards. But you'd have to figure that once the reverse track was discovered someone skilled enough would've made it long before Wade.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Well, he was able to memorize every single show, game, and movie without fail

Millions of minutes of content that he was able to absorb and recall in his short life"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"I think the best counterpoint to this is that you've laid this out very logically and would approach the challenge as a logical person.  But there's a certain percentage of the population who approach \*every\* challenge as ""how can I break this?"".  And those people would have figured out the first key immediately.  Even if it's just .01% of the population it would still have happened so fast with that much money on the line.

The book did it so much better by making it very obscure and remote instead of planting the first key in everyone's face."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"As someone who lives by the general rule that if a book doesn't grab you in 10 pages, don't finish it... I didn't finish this book. I dunno why but it felt off, almost in the same way Big Bang Theory felt off... like it was trying to cater to a nerdy audience without actually understanding how nerds operate."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I find isekai’s to be such incredibly lazy storytelling. “Oh no this dude from our world is suddenly a vending machine!” Aaaaaaand that’s it. That’s the plot. The rest is just generic anime filler.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,I really liked that game. I had it for colecovision and atari. I remember it being different for each. One was just random screens going left and right. The other is more expansive and even went underground. I might be remembering wrong.

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Not being first precludes it from being first, though. You could go left at the start of Pitfall in 1982. I don’t know if that was first, either, but it means Metroid isn’t."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Your premise posits that Metroidvania somehow became a different genre from the 2D platformer after it was released, just because when it launched, the genre didn't yet have a name. I, however, would argue that, even without a term to define what kind of a game it was, from day 1, Metroid was a very different kind of experience from what we recognize as the 2D platformer."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I dunno if 'single-handedly' is fair, as it and Castlevania both are responsible for the new genre, where both original entries came out within like the same month, hence the title the genre was eventually given.  Yeah, Metroid came out like 6 weeks earlier, but it's not like Castlevania was cobbled together in 6 weeks.  There was definitely some parallel thinking going on at the time."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Iirc pitfall didn't have levels. Just different screens that were kind of random. You appeared in a different screen with a challenge if you went off screen to the left or right.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Pitfall did it before Metroid, for sure. You just walked left instead of right, the map was circular"

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"What are you talking about? The core feature of a game classified as a metroidvania is that you need to explore, find blocked paths, and return to them later when you find upgrades that show you to get through. It has absolutely nothing to do with the graphical style or game mechanics. In fact those are the things that *differ* between metroidvanias that let them stand out from the rest."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"I don't... what? They're called Metroidvania because they're like Metroid and Castlevania. Mostly referring to Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night. That is, full of back tracking and retreading old areas as new upgrades open up new doors and paths that were inaccessible the first time you passed them.

Graphics have nothing to do with it. Plenty of first person shooters use Metroidvania style pathing, most notably Metroid Prime. The Star Wars: Jedi Order and Batman Arkham whatever games both qualify as well."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,That's the -Vania part of metroidvania.

“Search action” was a common term in Japan for that batch of open ended side scrollers that came along after Metroid’s release, some of which were certainly being developed while Metroid was."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"But the first Castlevania didn't allow for free exploration, that didn't come until Castlevania 2."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"It's always kind of interesting to work out how a game is designed in regards to secrets. Some games won't have anything, others have them crammed into every gap they can fit them into. Whether it's an item or an easter egg. Working that out early on definitely saves a lot of time."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,The only thing they did better in the movie is Art3mis. She's treated with the respect she didn't get in the book.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I enjoyed it but I can acknowledge that the book is basically nerd porn. It's a series of pop culture references wrapped in a semblance of a plot.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I mean the writing is REALLY bad. I got tired of the author saying ""This thing was great it's just like <insert random reference here>"" 

And I feel like he got paid extra every time he used the word classic. 

I honestly thought it was just me then a friend turned me on to the podcast ""372 Pages We'll Never Get back"" a podcast put on by the guys who do Riff Trax and their first 6-7 episodes are on Ready Player One and I'm glad to know I was not alone in my outrage."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I don’t think it is a niche target audience though, millions of people have read and enjoyed the book and went into the film expecting a more faithful adaptation. I hadn’t even heard of half the references but I was still captivated by the book. The film felt like just another script written about gamers by people who have a disdain for gaming"
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I actually enjoyed the movie thoroughly but I found the book to be tough to finish due primarily to the problematic relationship between Wade and Artemis. Stalking her until she finally gave him the chance he felt he deserved is some incel bullshit.
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Yeah… none of those are parallel universes. Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz are dream world scenarios, so not isekai, which has its own rules, typically in the vein of “person finds themselves in this world/body/scenario and doesn’t remember how they got there, but just acts like they would in our world”. It’s lazy and usually just treated as fantasy fulfilment of isekai writers to back door into the worlds they want to be in. It’s self-insert fan fiction at it’s finest.  

Apologies if I’ve somehow triggered you with my PERSONAL tastes, but grow the fuck up. People are allowed to like different things and have different opinions on the quality of storytelling devices. Isekai has crowded out manga and anime a *lot* especially in the last 10 years, and most people are tired of it.  But don’t worry man, I’m sure you’ll be able to get the latest edition of “Help I Was Reincarnated As A Blender In This Dungeon With No Power Outlet” every week as such a diehard fan of the genre.  

Edit: I mean... If your argument is to just block someone after making what was presumably a snotty reply, then you haven't got much of an argument to begin with."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,The oldest game I played that rewarded you for going backwards at the start was probably either Crash bandicoot or maybe sonic. Both I distinctively remember getting a free crate at the beginning. But there are older games so idk.

It's more than just a 2D platformer, but not quite the Metroidvanias that we know today.  It was more like whatever we might consider Mega Man, which I would definitely say was part of the stepping stones that led to Metroidvanias as we know them today."

18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,The movie missed the entire point.  In the book she is hesitant about the way she looks IRL which directly influences her personality/choices in life.  In the movie they made her typical hollywood looking girl.

I do agree with you though that Metroid being a metroidvania has nothing to do with going left at the start. As you said, lots of metroidvanias don't do that, and lots of games that aren't metroidvanias do.

That said, I don't think going left at the start is the same as going *backwards* at the start either. I'm honestly disappointed in this entire comment chain."
18mc508,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"Did you play it? Being a FPS doesn't prevent it from being a platformer. It's as much more a platformer than a shooter, most abilities are about movement rather than shooting. Do you even know what describes a Metroidvania? Exploration, find upgrades/items, unlock areas with those new abilities, rinse and repeat.

If you can go anywhere, anytime or if it unlocks because of the story, it's not a Metroidvania (like Soulsborne). It's fairly specific and it's exactly what Metroid and Castlevania are in most if not all of their iterations."

However calling a book Niche, trust me I would be considered the target audience doesn't excuse it from being lazy story telling. I enjoyed the movie, because while it was a big suspension of disbelief, I still had fun with it. 

The book though... OH lemme guess... you've seen this TV show from start to finish and memorized it? Ya don't say! OH and lemme guess... seen THAT movie 150 times and KNOW every phrase? Do tell me more... 

Oh and what was it 6 months he just sat on the poem, a poem that is 4 lines mind you and then he JUST figures it out? 

Stuff like this doesn't help tell a story, it literally jerks me out of the narrative and I'm all ""COME ON""."

>What you didn't find the entire chapter of him asking if she WAS REALLY a girl? Just to say... though I don't really care... BUT seriously are you a girl?

At this point in time of the book, I don't think Wade ever thought he'd actually meet Artemis. She could've lied to him and said she was a girl, and they'd live happily ever after in their virtual world, even if she was, in reality, a 45 year-old, balding, obese ~~reddit mod~~ man that lived 4 stacks over and 3 levels lower from Wade."

That was definitely an artifact of the time the book was released(late 00s, right?) that was iffy back then and has only gotten worse since. We were just coming down from peak ""there's no girls on the internet""/""mmorpg = many men online role playing girls loool"" at the time. We were *also* in a period of high homophobia(compared to today), where guys were very concerned with not being gay, not even by mistake. They were genuinely afraid that they might accidentally get tricked into being gay with a man who was pretending to be a girl. It doesn't mean I want to read about it in 2023, but I understand where the attitude comes from, because I witnessed those demands to prove you're a girl(which usually wound up with everybody creeping on you once you'd proven it)."

76mve6,2017-10-16,2017-10-16,"Best way I can lay out how I did it: Got a front opening shadow box measuring 8x10 with an inch in depth. Cut and glued thin wooden planks to the sides of the interior of the box, about half an inch in depth. I cut out both the black forefront and dark grey background with an exacto knife and made sure the borders lined up right with the dimensions of the box (pretty much just had to eye ball it as I didn't have a ruler). Glued the edges of the dark grey layer to the top of the wooden planks on the inside of the box. Cut out a layer of transparent paper, glued it down over the opening of the entire box. Finally, took the black layer, laid it flat against the glass and glued the edges on the back of the frame, so it wouldn't show on the glass itself, and sealed the entire thing shut. 

Long winded I know, but I hope this helps. Kinda hard to walk through the process without a visual aid. "

194wmq1,2024-01-12,2024-01-13,One of the recommended driving games is Burnout Paradise. I doubt anyone would pick Paradise when even picking a Burnout. It also recommends Mass Effect 2 without Mass Effect 1 before. Really poor judgment.

194wmq1,2024-01-12,2024-01-13,Same with answering no to loosing yourself in a world leads to DK Country. Thats such a wonderful world though!
194wmq1,2024-01-12,2024-01-13,"I mean to be fair though, it’s not a definite thing, and it’s assuming you don’t know what you’re looking for yet. Maybe at a certain point it decides you might be willing to do some puzzles if you’re wanting to meet your other criteria"
194wmq1,2024-01-12,2024-01-13,"Yeah the creator just crammed a ton of final fantasy games into it and then just picked other titles at random. Its a cool chart, but absolutely biased and some of the previously ""answered"" questions were clearly lost along the way. As someone else mentioned, the single yes or no between castlevania and Skyrim really illustrates the weak points of this chart."

1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Has to do with art style. The more stylistic, the harder it is to age while photorealism always ages poorly because of the strong contrast with modern graphics as they continue to improve (although that arguably is coming to an end)."

I want to say Inside, but apparently that's not the case based off of the comments below."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Art direction>graphical fidelity.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I'm probably in a minority here but I felt that while visually the game was simply sublime, the actual game itself was very underwhelming. It was a major case of style over substance. It didn't wow me and felt it was very short. But that's just me!"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I remember my very first time playing it. A friend made me play it. I held right and jumped at the first cliff like it was a Mario game. While Limbo boy was in mid air my friend was like: ""What are you doing!""

Limbo boy fell on the ground broke his legs and died.

""Ohh... it's not a jump'n'run game!""

I played through the whole game and still think it has one of the best endings in gaming ever!"

1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,*This post has filled me with determination
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Playdead supposedly is making new game but it has been 8 years since they released Inside. Would be nice if they provide any news about this new project.

Just wish that was more common knowledge."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Oh the memories, such a good game. This one and Inside have been short, but sweet experience."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I'm not usually an indie game-player, but got this because of a review on IGN / a demo that hooked me.

Gives me chills every time I think about it. An incredible game that proves you don't need amazing graphics etc."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-13,"Inside was just as good although the story was a complete mind fry, but Limbo has a special place in my heart"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-13,Reminds me of the Ori games.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-14,"Alright, alright, alright"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-15,Looks like a Ninja Arashi game. :)
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Inside doesn’t hit hard like limbo
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Wait for HD Remaster with colors /s
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Most indie games never age because they were made for gamers and not money
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Bingo. Wind Waker > Twilight Princess
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Limbo, Inside, Monument Valley and Stray are some of the few games which I actually like because of this style thing."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Agreed.  Borderlands 1 looks way better now than any of the grey/brown ""realistic"" shooters of it's time."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I don't think that's the issue with aging. Lots of highly stylized games aged like garbage (Parappa the rapper) and lots of realistic games aged beautifully: Myst, Donkey Kong Country, Crysis, Starcraft. 

More a matter of sensible art direction and use of the tech.. or it is a matter of gameplay, not visuals being the most important element. Nobody thought early 3D games ""look better"" than 2D games, no matter their approach. But they did let us explore actual 3D worlds, which was super cool."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Idk about always, I definitely went back to some old games and went “damn this looks worse than I remembered”"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Have you played their second game, ""INSIDE""?"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"IMO it has very low re-playability value, once you go through the experience there's little to pull you back in

  
i'll compare it to something like Super Metroid, which i've somehow been playing once a year since 1993"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Limbo
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,They need to make it a rule that the post has to have the name of the game.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Limbo, you can legitimately buy it for like $1-2 on sale and its short and great."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,You might be. Are you older than twenty-five?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,It is a 10 for me
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,shit
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"This isn't really true. Lots of realistic games aged fantastically well- Myst, Starcraft, Crysis.

And Limbo looks great because it does use highly realistic graphics elements. The blur/depth of field is realistic. The diffuse lighting, ambient occlusion, shadow effects... is realistic lighting. The physics of the MC and obects in the world is highly realistic and needed to solve puzzles."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I just remembered that a few days ago. Gonna be an Epic Game Store game tho
."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Guessing you’ve played Cocoon? How’d you enjoy it?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"*Inside* is quite unsettling, I wonder what she'll think about it."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Not sure what you mean. Limbo made use of advanced graphics for the time. It just ""baked"" them in and they weren't real-time. Like the depth of field, light & shadow, and physics."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,You're close! The game in the image is Limbo. The next game from the dev team is Inside.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I totally agree with you, I was hooked on the free demo that ends with you getting stuck in the spider web, everything after that point in the game is a massive disappointment, I didnt like the puzzle designs or the lack of horror after act 1."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,You know the version where [the main character had a flashlight?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVMKpcbCn4M)
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,... and what is it called?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Indie games are still made for money...they still have bills to pay
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Twilight Princess is still my favorite Zelda. I replay it every year. Wind Waker just doesn't hit for me even if the visuals have aged better.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,It's also just a much better game. Would anyone say Skyward Sword>TP?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"The OG of both look really bad. Wind Waker was on GameCube was a chunky 480p with primitive lighting/shadows that now looks like trash when entire scenes are 100% brightness with only stencil and baked shadows. The walls, ground,  sea, and links face being flat and featureless.. now it feels like being in cardboard boxes with pictures glues to them."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,[deleted]
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-13,Speaking of Limbo and Inside. Playdead it’s been 8 years release something so I can give you more money.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Loved Inside. That was my introduction. Very cinematic gameplay. I got really sucked into it and found myself just playing it through. So very rewarding though.

Did they do anything after Inside? I was on the look out for similar and/or better games from them."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,For me one of the greatest games ever made. A masterpiece in the truest sense.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-13,"Bro Inside was a whole era for me. One time my buddy and I got some paper and coded out the tones for the >!true ending!<, and it was an unforgettable payoff. I'm obsessed with that ending now and I replay it whenever I think about it. It's like a certain kind of fear? Kind of liminal? The only other time I've felt like that in a game was the >!escape pod ending!< in Stanley Parable."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Agree.  I have never replayed it.  I just think back on it fondly and I've been hoping to find something that resonates with me as strongly as this game did when I first played it.

  
I loved it because it was beautifully done, intriguing, and short.  I love games that are only like 5-10 hours of play time.  I think this one was even less."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I really liked it but it never really hits the heights of that first level again, the rest of the game was a very solid platformer but the spider was really memorable."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"No, 31 haha"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Where did you read this?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Nope I haven't. Not the same vibe from what I've seen. The sense of dread that Inside conveys is something I've never seen before in a game.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I haven't played it yet, either. Hopefully not too bad?"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Yeh, i got it day one and completed it in my first sitting and just went... Was that it?"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Limbo
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"TP is the peak of the traditional 3D Zelda games. Visually it doesn’t stand up quite as well as WW. And isn’t quite as iconic as OoT. But I honestly believe it’s the best overall game in the series. Best story for sure. Solid gameplay. Largest and most useful list of dungeon items in the series. Best side kick in the series by a WIDE margin. Really cool aesthetic. 

Windwaker aged better visually. OoT will always be bigger due to its importance to gaming as a whole. And MM is probably the most unique with its time travel shenanigans. But TP will always be the best overall game when taking all of its parts as a whole."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"The cell shading is nice and I have no problem with that aspect of WW's graphics.  However, I just don't like the character designs.  I just couldn't get into it because of how wacky the characters looked.

So, even if the graphics aged worse, the detail was much better.  I also appreciated the characters and story much more."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"If they cut out the beginning (tutorial) of TP, it would be one of the best games of all time. I think more people would hold it as high as ALttP and OoT. Some of the dungeons in that game were insanely good, it's a shame BotW dropped dungeons altogether."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Phantom hourglass also aged nicely, the only one that held my attention. "
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I disagree Twillight is my favourite Zelda. Wind Waker is a close second though, even if the late game suffers a lot"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Honestly, I think a lot of the PS2 games that were going for a realistic aesthetic actually look better than a lot of PS3 games that did the same.

The lack of hardware power, despite being able to push so many more polygons, still forced limitations on the devs that still required them to be creative with their art direction.

Everything still looks great, just ever so slightly cartoonish, which keeps most of those games from hitting the uncanny valley."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"They are currently working on something right now.

One of the lead level designers from Inside made his own game called Cocoon.

Cocoon is pretty short but brilliant. Absolutely loved it. I think it's on gamepass"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"The Little Nightmares games are a different dev but scratched the same sort of itch for me, had a blast playing them."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Without a single word of spoken dialogue it says 10x more than most games through amazing environmental and background details. Truly a masterpiece
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Goddammit, this warrants a holiday playthrough"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,It was a lot of fun but I couldnt finish it. Now i am curious if i can be spoiled for the ending? Please thank you!
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Damn, math ain’t mathing."

1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Have you played Soma?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"The feeling of Cocoon in a nutshell:

[https://media1.tenor.com/m/lAE6lprJVEAAAAAd/futurama-farnsworth.gif](https://media1.tenor.com/m/lAE6lprJVEAAAAAd/futurama-farnsworth.gif)"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2025-01-30,"Yeah very true. Inside is a genuine masterwork, first and foremost for its atmosphere. I would say its puzzles are brilliantly designed as well and take what would have been a fantastic work of art in its own right and elevate it to the overall masterpiece that it is. 

That quality in puzzle design is even slightly elevated in Cocoon I would argue, but yes it’s atmosphere and world building isn’t as strong, it’s just not the focus. 

Maybe the other great game to capture the feeling of dread that Inside managed might be Bloodborne, of course a completely different kind of game. 

Did you get the secret ending of Inside? After getting all collectibles?"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"It's nothing you haven't seen in *Limbo*, until maybe the end of the game, but now with colors. The atmosphere and gameplay mechanics, however, play a bigger role in the ""horrific"" experience."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"For me, Twilight Princess was special because it was the last Zelda game made by the original Zelda team of developers that made Ocarina of Time, and it felt like a spiritual successor to OOT

OOT was childhood for me and TP was towards the end of my childhood so it was special in that way. Objectively, I think OOT is the best Zelda game ever made as far as technical and cultural impact for video games"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Weird, I never really liked it.  I always thought it's one of the weakest in the span between OOT and BotW.  Never liked Skyward Sword either but that was because of the forced movement controls."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,My only issue with WW is the lead up to the end where it's obvious they ran out of time and just gated the final boss behind fishing up treasures over the entire map.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"For me, Link in WW is the most normal looking boy in the game, so it’s easy for me to still believe he’s a hero. I love that world so so much. But also my suspension of disbelief is stretchier than OP’s mother’s pantyhose."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Okay but were you Team Edward or Jake?
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Somerville is more like playdeads other games, from the guy who split off to form his own team.

Cocoon is more a puzzle game"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Cacoon is insanely cool, some of its puzzles are real brain twisters"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Loved these games. Excited for the third one coming
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I felt that the first one was a little too Outlast and didn't really do it for me. But the second took far more clear inspiration from Limbo and Inside and was a massive improvement.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-13,It makes you feel VULNERABLE. That's difficult to do in a video game. Masterpiece.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I read 35, I should start learning to read, it might come in handy one day."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,No.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Ah ok, she'll love it then."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Same and they even had the hero of time as a character in TP - he was the undead sword master dude who taught you moves.
 
IIRC that was canonically the Hero of Time from OoT."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-14,"It’s definitely got its weak points. The opening takes far too long(an issue SS had as well). Plus an abundance of chests making finding one less special(much like WWs litany of sunken treasure). And the graphics haven’t aged very well(although I feel a proper HD remaster would help that quite a bit. The actual aesthetic is still quite good). But overall it’s a great evolution of the OoT formula. 

Story wise it’s one of the few in the series that makes you actually care about the stakes and characters. That’s actually one of SS strengths as well if you can get past the controls and weak opening. Gameplay is just a refinement of OoT and WW. And they managed to make pretty much every dungeon item fun and useful. Something the series has struggled with in the past. Taking out a horde of bokoblins with the ball and chain while using the spinner to dodge around feels really good to me. 

And man. Again. The characters. There’s a reason Midna is one of the most beloved characters in the franchise only behind the main 3 despite only featuring in one game. And several other side characters are quite memorable as well. 

I just really wish Nintendo would release it on the switch 2. Would love a modern port of it so much."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Team Jedward.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I'm team I don't know what the heck that means
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Agreed, Cocoon  is much more puzzle based. I enjoyed Somerville, but it didn't really have that spark that made Inside or Cocoon feel special to me. 

But yeah, Somerville is closer gameplay-wise to Inside"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,All good dude it was a nice laugh for me in the morning lol. Happens to me when I have no coffee!
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Hope she's OK with some slightly creepy imagery. The pig is a bit off 
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Yep that aspect was so awesome
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"It's a Twilight reference, except it's supposed to be Jacob, not Jake.

Vampires (Edward) or Werewolves (Jacob)."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I agree about it missing *something*

Cocoon was so addicting I finishing it in one stream/sitting. Really cool ideas and just kept adding another wrinkle. Thinking games are great. Way different but this year I played Talos Prinicple 2 and it was pretty profound and great"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Oh, I only watched the last movie (>!I believe it's the last one, it's the one were the final battle turned out to be an imaginary one!<) so I don't know the name of any character"
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I've heard great things about both Talos Principle games. I should really give them a shot
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I've never read the books or movies, but my fiancee did back in the day, so I've learned a lot from her.

I think the series ends with Bella (the girl who ends up with Edward) has her baby eat its way out of her."
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,You should! Start with 1.
1hc60e5,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Play Lorelei and the laser eyes and gorogoa then thank me later

It's like, when you're four, and you think that combining your favorite foods: Mac 'n' Cheese and Chocolate Ice Cream, will make something you like even better. But it doesn't. It creates a really gross mess.

And this is how I feel about these. You see a lot of them on /r/gaming, usually involving Limbo surprisingly. Limbo+Portal. Limbo+Zelda. My girlfriend just drew this picture combining Portal and Minecraft, what do you think? Well, I think it's bad. Some things are better left separate. I wish some things were just left separate. I just want my Chocolate Ice Cream by itself, left alone."

If you like this that's fine, all I'm asking is the reddit populace to discourage reposting to such a degree. I feel like you're excusing it and it's really a negative on the community. If you don't care, then whatever, I'm not here to convince you. "

18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-22,"Not necessarily a dumb name, but any game where the sequel uses all the same exact words, but adds a few more, will be a pain in the ass if you just want the original game.

For example, I was recently trying to look up ""Mario Bros"". Which, of course, Google assumed I really wanted ""Super Mario Bros"", or a detailed analysis of Mario and Luigi, or all sorts of other junk. And what can I do? I can't add ""-super"", because certainly every article on the game is going to mention that it's the precursor to the rest of the series, if not just say the word ""super"" somewhere in the middle of a sentence. So eventually I just manually went to GameFAQs and StrategyWiki and looked up the game myself.

But commonly I see this happen with numbered sequels. So, like, it's not easy to look up the first ""Final Fantasy"" without getting a lot of crap from ""Final Fantasy 2"", ""Final Fantasy 3"", etc. And you can't really say ""Final Fantasy 1"", because nobody called it that back when the game first came out and all the stuff started to get written about it.

Actually, for another example, that did happen not too long ago when I was trying to look up stuff for Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology, in Japanese. Except the game has two sequels, Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2 and 3, which had far eclipsed the first one in terms of popularity. And I don't know enough Japanese to really specify deeply, and certainly stuff like ""Weapon list"" and ""monsters"" is going to be mentioned by every single game. And somehow I don't think banning the numbers ""2"" and ""3"" is going to work well to find pages about an RPG."

And coincidentally, WB is one of a myriad of companies that has forgotten to fear its customers. Not the shareholders, mind; I'm talking about the people who actually buy their products. If they feared us like they're supposed to, we wouldn't be in this mess."

Journey is many wonderful things, a feast for the eyes and ears not least among them, but it is first and foremost a masterpiece in co-op experimentation. By making co-op play completely optional (benefits to each player are minimal), the game invites us to make a truly free choice about how we want to play; and by dramatically restricting players' expressive options (just chirps, hops, and shimmies), the game invites us to pay close attention to what the other player is trying to tell us or ask us.

I played Journey on the PS3 back in 2012 and found it to be a towering, indelible experience.

18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"Ohh yeah I keep forgetting about those operators. Thanks a lot, I’ll keep that in mind (although I’m pretty much done with that game for now)."
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"Farcry 3,4,5 or 6"
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,Yes. Guess Who?
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,Are there various videos of them live?
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,Reminds me of this bit: https://youtu.be/Mdqv5xIsFLM?si=RZaGqNE-ZL6REIQd
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"My friend actually did this! He was in a punk band in the 90s and their first and only album was titled ""Greatest Hits"" lmao."
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"Just so you know, there is a game that does exactly that with a game, Samurai Warriors 4-II, that's because it is SW4 but it is a remaster, but it adds some stuff and apparently increments the story.

Also, there's Final Fantasy X and X-2, but X-2 is the second disc of the game iirc."

The original is also called DOOM so to differentiate on a google search you have to google DOOM 2016."

18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,But then how do you search for the original now? Using just the title brings up the franchise and every game except the original
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"I hadn't considered that, but then what will they call the next one?"
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"It’s entirely unrelated, not a remake, reboot, nor sequel. They only used the name cuz they had it laying around in their unused IP drawer."
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"No, you definitely just lost The Game."
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"Well duh. You wouldn't find much about call of duty if you wrote call on Google either. That's a failure on the party using the search engine, not the name of the game. 

Try finding help for the game called foundation. Most hits on Google will have nothing to do with the game, even when searching for specific help."

18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,"Whoa whoa whoa.

Farcry 6 is a different beast then Farcry 3/4 

Honestly just give me a skill tree, and better weapon choices back and I’ll be happy. Also none of that weird ammo switching if possible.


Edit: ok this might have been a little brash. But there is a fairly big difference. In Farcry 6 they took a lot of choice away from the player and forced them into things. When skills get tied to gear you can’t just use a set that you want forever. And the ammo switching restricted you to weapons you had upgraded and even some unique weapons don’t have the ability to switch from their designated ammo type. Which forces you to switch to certain weapons or do significantly less damage."
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-21,Because you are a person of culture.
18n6v1w,2023-12-20,2023-12-22,"I remember a review of X-2 in some gaming magazine that said the difference between X and X-2 was too confusing, so they were going to refer to X-2 as Final Fantasy: Girl Power! and then abbreviated the game as FFGP! for the rest of the article."

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-04,[Codename: Kids Next Door](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codename:_Kids_Next_Door) a mid-2000's Cartoon Network show.

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,Well fuck... Apparently we are referencing shows from the 2000s.  Damn 14 year olds! get off my lawn!
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Who is that?
"
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"To be fair, they learned their lesson after their attempt to have more 'reality' shows backfired.  Then Adventure Time came out, And Regular Show, and both of them decimated their competition in ratings.  Since then they've gotten better with their programming, but they're still a far cry from their late 90s early 2000s lineup.  "

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,Thank you! I thought at least a *few* people would bring up the name of the show.
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmceJic1JhU) is what happened to Cartoon Network. In my opinion Cartoon Network never really fell off (except when they tried the live action stuff) they had Camp Lazlo, Foster's, and Chowder in the mid to later 2000s to tide us over for the amazing shows that are Regular Show and Adventure TIme that we have today."

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,Or cartoons have simply lost their appeal to us other than the nostalgic ones
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Adventure Time is successful because it appeals to a a larger age group. For example, I would watch the shit out of Adventure Time, but most other cartoons are horrible in my opinion."

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Thanks.,"
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"I think that cartoons are in a transitional phase. It's much easier to make a kids cartoon than a family one, but the family ones will get more viewers. So it comes down to whether they want to create a simpler show or potentially make more money.

Money usually wins in the end.

I think that Cartoon Network will have very few ""kids only"" shows in 5 years."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Erm, no. 

It isn't just nostalgia talking when people judge these shows. Re-watch them, they're still enjoyable even today. Writers back then had a lot more freedom with what they could produce so there are plenty of jokes in there for adults as well, that you may have missed when you were younger. 

Now, that's not to say that there aren't any good cartoons today. There are plenty today as well, a commonly mentioned one being Adventure Time. 

I enjoy cartoons, both new and old. 

Don't insult the shows saying that people enjoy them only out of nostalgia. They are genuinely good shows ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugrats#Awards_and_nominations and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed,_Edd_n_Eddy#Ratings_and_run_length_achievements)."

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Definitely the correct use of legitimate, also while we're being aspies who correct grammar, you should know that quotation marks aren't used for emphasis, italics are."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,You.... Where... Toilets..... Numbah 2.... What did you do to him..... WHY DID YOU GO THROUGH MISSION F.L.U.S.H!!!!
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"I'm just tired of people saying cartoons were better in the 90's/2000's because if I had no sentimental attachments to a cartoon like Ed, Edd, and Eddy I would think it's awful or stupid just like teenagers/adults think cartoons are today. Kids will watch pretty much any cartoon and later as grown-ups they will think it was/will always be the best. We simply outgrow cartoons (most people) but idealize the nostalgic ones imo."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"I think this is actually true.  I've noticed over the past 2 years that western animated shows had a jump in quality over all.  Not all of them of course, but there's a lot of great shit coming out.  Legend of Korra, Adventure Time, Regular Show, Friendship is Magic, Young Justice, Green Lantern the Animated Series, Transformers Prime, and Gravity Falls.  The How to Train Your Dragon show coming up also looks like its going to be good, as its going to take a darker tone than the other Dreamworks shows.  Sure, some awful stuff is popping up here and there, but a lot of really high quality animated shows are being made!  Its really refreshing actually and much better than Reality TV that is seriously mucking up live action stuff (Though yes, I do enjoy some reality TV).  "
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Relax, I explained to someone else that **most** people simply claim their better for nostalgia's sake. I'm pretty confident that most people don't analyze the nuances of cartoons. You do and that's fine but really if you haven't seen ""90's kids will get this"" then  you haven't looked on your FB feed. I have re-watched cartoons from my youth and honestly I don't enjoy them."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Ah. So how does Calvin die? Old age, or does he simply stop taking care of himself, and just fade away?"
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"That's true, but it bugged me."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Also, punctuation goes inside the quotation marks."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,[deleted]
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"See, I completely understand that.  Despite growing up in that era, I still don't really like rewatching E,E&E, Courage, or Johnny Bravo unless I have a thick pair of nostalgia goggles on.    

However, even being 24, I still enjoy watching Chowder, Adventure Time, Regular Show, and I have a special place in my heart for Flapjack; despite all of them coming a good portion after the late 90s early 2000 nostalgia bubble.

I attribute this to CN realizing (probably with the success of Adult Swim), that there's more money to be made in shows that appeal to a larger audience (13-28), rather than the 8-12 crowd."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"To be fair, cartoons at that time were a lot more organized. The animation styles didn't diverge as much and there were often all sorts of crossovers.

I think that the best cartoons of today are better than those of the early 2000's, but there was certainly a cartoon culture that we don't have today. Everything is all over the place because animation is becoming more culturally acceptable for adults to watch. There are a lot of cool experiments going on, but nobody's on the same page."

xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Yeah honestly I have tried to watch those cartoons again from childhood and I'm just incredibly bored. They'll always have that nostalgic value, however. And I haven't watched the new cartoons really but the general consensus seems to be their geared toward older viewers which means those who are saying 90's cartoons are better make no sense because the cartoons today are made for them!"
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"I understand your points but honestly I'd say evaluating the quality of cartoons is pretty subjective. I don't have much of an idea on adults watching cartoons but for the majority of opinions people simply like to say their old cartoons were better. You, however, have your own criteria which is great since you have more to say than ""I grew up with them!"""
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"That ending was deep, man. I'm not sure I like Calvin being in limbo, trapped as his inner child who never could move on"
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"He once single handedly defeated the KND (well, #1-5), but in his boasting he let them escape somehow or something. It's been a while."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"I think it's fair to comment on the quality of entertainment. It's subjective, but it's also easy to tell when a show's writers are talented. I actually do a lot of comedy analysis. Here's a blurb I wrote on an Adventure Time thread:

>Adventure Time is a progressive kids show that makes a lot of winks to adults. It revamps the common plot structure of children's programming to introduce the idea of complex problems that are not black and white. It also tends to ditch any simple morals by contradicting itself in ways that promote outside-the-box thinking.

>It's kinda...the kids' show of the future."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"He took out mister boss, crazy cat lady, the homos in the love seat, and the night bracer all by himself when he mistook them for the real knd
He got his ass kicked when the real ones came back to their tree houseov"
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"hahhahaha, He was the hulk of the series."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"I haven't watched cartoons in a few years but I'm actually separating you from most people I know who say ""Only 90's kids will get this/watched this."" You have specifics where they really don't know why they like one thing over another besides the nostalgia. However, I'd still have to say that typical 5-12 year olds are not going to put in much thought as to why they like the show either. Cartoons are usually simple for simple minds and for the most part miss older demographics."
xomy2,2012-08-04,2012-08-05,"Yeah, I understand that most consumers don't analyze their entertainment like I do, but the demographic for cartoons is quickly changing to be just as watched by the college crowd as children. Remember that Adult Swim, a programming block that almost exclusively plays adult cartoons, is up there with the best/most popular late-night programming."

noikz,2011-12-23,2011-12-27,"> 2.25 during the Stream sale. Totally worth it.

Depends on the person.  I just finished every achievement, and found numerous problems.  Namely, the game is too easy. Limbo, while it has an excellent atmosphere, has very poor game design for the following reasons:

* No closure.
* No replayability.
* Too repetitive, frustrating gameplay because your timing is not within the 5 ms window.

It's like the book: Lord of the Flies.  Completely over-rated.

I tell my friends that, like Mirror's Edge, you have more fun watching the walkthrough on youtube, sadly.  It will save you the frustration of dieing. Over. And over. Again.

Cool atmosphere, just poor game mechanics.

Oh well, least I only wasted 1 day on it.

A few of them required timing (when the world starts spinning) and I died more frequently on those ones. But the water one was the most frustrating for me because I kept trying the wrong solution for so long.

My only real complaint about this game is that it was unfortunately short. I would have preferred another hour of game play at the least.

5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,Me too. I was kinda enjoying it (spooky spider at the beginning was terrifying) but then fizzled out a bit with all the water puzzles.

5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,I'm pretty sure the darkest twist is the entire damn game!
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-04,It is not a spoiler I believe but no problem. It is okay to get some down votes. 
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"Yes, that's one of the jokes."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"There's a story, but there's a lot left to the imagination, I thought it was really interesting."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,Frustrating as fuck at times though.
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,Agreed. It needed more spookiness to keep the vibes going
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"No. You're striving the entire game. In getting to the end, the child loses. But you actually have to think about the ending instead of just enjoying your success at the game to realize that. The win for the player is the loss for the character.

\* I fixed the spelling."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,Very dark....VERY VERY DARK...except those beady little eyes...

EDIT: op has since fixed his comment. "
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"See, I always thought the implication was that the kids were [dead to begin with, and it was literally you travelling through Limbo after death to determine whether you're stuck there, go to hell, or go to heaven, with completing the game being escaping to heaven and getting killed without restarting leaving you in hell.](/spoiler)

Then again, I'm not up on my Christian mythology, so I may have been reading too much into it."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"https://youtu.be/2kgZZ89mh-Q?t=95

Observe. You get to the end. Now you have a helper. Say you keep playing. What do you do next?

You've found your sister, but you can no longer move to the right, and the ladder is out of reach without one of you at the bottom to boost the other up. 

If you keep watching the end of the credits, it comes back to the same scene with a broken ladder and a dead body at the bottom of it. Maybe someone escaped, but certainly not both."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"I know it. I got it wrong because I did a bunch of pre-submit editing trying to clarify the difference between the player and the character.

To Lose - both have one O.

Too Loose - Both have two O's.

I always found that the easiest way to remember."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5lbqy7/when_in_limbo/dbvhkd7/

No mythology needed. Just observing the state at the end of the game."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"I just watched this and the only thing I see is the last rung of the ladder hanging off the end, not a body"
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,I don't see a dead body.
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,I like the sneaky edit 
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"If you turn on the annotations, it points out the flies circling the decidedly non-grassy lump at the bottom, neither of which were there when the credits started. A bit hard to see on youtube, though."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"There are flies circling at the bottom that weren't there before the credits.  It might be a bit hard to see in Youtube, but there's an annotation pointing them out."
5lbqy7,2016-12-31,2017-01-01,"Sorry. You're right. I should have said, since you were specifically commenting on what I went and fixed."

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hello! I'm the one-man developer, Inasa. 

All the criticsm is really helpful and I am aware of the emptiness and boring gameplay. It's a work in progress and I didn't plan for everyone to suddenly find my project. I had 100 followers on Twitter 3 days ago to put the suddenness into context. Game dev is a small hobby of mine plus I'm still a full time college student studying Illustration so I really hoped that people found the project in a more finished state. Hope you are interested in the development! 

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Inasa_Fujio) I don't have anything else setup!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Not too much more info other than the title, it is called Inaka Project for now and is still in early development so no release date or platforms announced. No website or anything so the only place for updates at the moment is on the developer's twitter [@Inasa_Fujio](https://twitter.com/Inasa_Fujio)

Not my game, came across it on twitter after their tweet sort of went viral."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Pff, the gaming world is too mail-dominated as it is."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"The first seconds of the video like: «Rise and shine, mr. Freeman»."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,How can I prevent forgetting about this in a couple minutes and actually keep up with more news about release/demo/videos?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I lived in Iwakuni for years and would take the local train to small villages in the middle of nowhere for fun. Grab a 6 pack of chu-hi beers and just wonder around for hours. It looks exactly like this. Gunna have to follow this one.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I'm getting impression that this game will be a lot like Firewatch but with more things to do and places to explore. And it sounds awesome.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Can't wait for the Totoro DLC
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This is why I hate video games. It appeals to the mail fantasy.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Me, playing video games, Circa 1999: ""I WANNA BE A WIZARD OR A NINJA OR A VAMPIRE ON A JOURNEY OF VENGEANCE!""

&#x200B;

Me, playing video games, Circa 2019: ""I'd just like to be a mailman."""
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This makes me want an entire VR game that is very realistic that sole purpose is to teach you how to use/navigate the Japanese transit system. maybe even have it teach you the basic words you need to understand.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"There's definitely a market for this type of project.  For instance - my dad ""plays"" GTA 5. He's never shot a weapon in-game. Doesn't do any of the things the game was meant for. 

All  he does is explore.  He's old, is at the early stages of dementia, and gave up driving a while ago.  He no longer travels, due to health reasons, but he enjoys exploring a virtual world (based on a real location).

He drives carefully in GTA.  He obeys every traffic light and sign.  He doesn't crash into people.  Sometimes the AI crashes in to him, but he understands that he's not playing the game ""as intended"" so brushes it off. 

He explores. He takes pictures.  He eavesdrops on the conversations of the npc's around him... He doesn't do any missions, etc.  

And holy shit does he enjoy it. 

With a little more world building and populating it - this could fill a great niche.

excellent work!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I love simple concept games, especially when done well. I hope development stays on track and we see it released soon!"

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Probably not a game for me since I'm already living in the inaka .... Though I gotta say it's nice to see a game that takes place in contemporary Japan and not in the Tokyo metropolitan area lol. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Kinda reminds me of firewatch

Then the actual developer “randomly” just happens to show up in the comments. “Hey, this is actually my game! I can’t believe it’s on Reddit because I totally didn’t pay people to advertise for me and I just so happened to see this post!!”

Seriously, mods. If people want to push their games that’s fine, but you guys need to step in and make it clear that we’re being advertised to here. Stop letting shit like this constantly reach the front page where it’s just one giant ad pretending to be an innocent and organic post. "

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"The art style reminds me of Jalopy somewhat, but far more than just that. Hopefully this game will be half as fun as the monotonous fun of Jalopy, so I can put plenty of hours in it. Now what would be really neat is if it subtly taught you words and phrases in Japanese. Slowly over time going from English dialog with the people you interact with to Japanese while having some kind of reference key in case it doesn't fully click quite yet."

Not sure where you plan to take it but makes me think of a Miyazaki movie theme.  Would love to be able to walk through the various worlds and locations to interact with characters (Porco & Calcifer!) from his stories!"

They could be DLC and could have different stories. You could try to partner with corporations without selling the rights to the base game!"

Don't worry about the game looking ""boring"" there's a lot of games that are deliberately slow, almost meditative in their approach (the so-called ""walking simulators"") and it looks like your game might be one of them. You might want to take a look at some of them if you want to see how they dealt with the issue of realtively little amounts of what's usually considered gameplay. Besides, the amount of new followers you got after publishing the video of what you got so far means there's a lot of people who would love to play it as it looks like now :)

Keep up the good work, I can't wait to see the end result!"

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Yes please
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,So that's how HL3 starts
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Is this inspired from the movie ""Postmen in the mountains"" ?"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"If you're making a gameplay trailer, consider using joystick, it will produce a smoother camera movement as you can make slow/fast movement depending on what you need, and the change is more gradual."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"looks good, I really hope it keeps to a simple premise and doesn't get filled with random crap. It also gives me the opportunity to explore japanese country side without actually going there (too poor), reminds me of Persona 4/golden except you know.... first person."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,yokai?

Walked around from sun up to sun down alone, meeting locals, and drinking a cold Sapporo outside an impeccably clean 7-11 was unreal. Having never really traveled before this experience was dreamlike. This game seems to totally encapsulate that. "

Like it starts off normal then a Shinto priest says he has a letter. Weirdly the letter has a time on it, says after nightfall. You go during the day, the location is a vacant lot, at night, ab old temple appears...

Suddenly you find yourself delivering mail, prayers, seals, etc, between yokai, tanuki, priests, and even normal people.

A kind letter and spirits can move on, free of regret..."

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Spirits and Yokai huh? Now that sounds awesome. Is it all meant to be so pleasant looking or will some interactions be more tense? There’s a lot of variety in Yokai so I’m interested in feeling an array of emotions interacting with them. When reading the title, my mind immediately went to the absurdity of delivering a letter to some giant fish in the middle of a lake, and having a Kappa steal my mail, and a tense interaction of handing a letter to a Kuchisake-Onna or Gashadokuro in some dark alley or forest."

I’ve actually been thinking to myself a lot “I wish there was a game set in Japan where you can just travel around and see it.”

I’m excited!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Looks neat. I'd love to just walk around and look at stuff in VR. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Is this early game play footage of death stranding? 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Is there a main plot/story line or at least a quests besides the letters (finding a significant other, etc) that could keep the game interesting for the long run. It looks like a awesome game and would totally buy it if there were other things to do! Looks amazing keep up the good work!!!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Was SO hoping this was a want ad.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This seems like a really pleasant and peaceful game. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Can I also get back injuries?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,THE KITCHEN LOOKS JUST LIKE MY KITCHEN!!!!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It reminds me of Doraemon
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I hope theres cute oni girls.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Where do I download this and can I get it on a Samsung phone?

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Murakami making games now?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,I would play the hell out of this.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Lovely
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Concept seems good. Good luck dev.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"This looks amazing! I hope you can explore Japan and ~~crush people's UPS boxes~~ indulge in the rich, beautiful culture that I know. The only thing that I want is a low price tag and a diverse range of interactable NPC's to remember."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,I need a weapon.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Welcome to the OASIS.

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,I need this! 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"This seems like the kind of relaxing game you can kinda just play and get lost in , rather than be focused on completing a laundry list of tasks . I'm gonna have to look up more this looks like something I could get into "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"It reminds me of ""firewatch"" a little bit "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"“I’ve got a letter for you. You’re eyes only...”

All throughout town while sprinting everywhere"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"Are you developing this game? If so, I'd love to check it out on my stream! Hit me up! "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Will it be on PS4?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,The crosshair looks like you’re gonna shoot things 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,This is Paperboy! 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Imagine being able to support yourself from one part-time job only.. that’d be all I ever want
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,This game looks so pretty!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"This was pretty much my life as a English teacher in Japan for 3 years. Can confirm this gave me flashbacks, but the apartment needs to be at least 1/3 that size."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"I love this kind of art style in games. Much more pleasant to the eye than ""Very realistic"" style graphics."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Probably the only way I'll be able to afford to take a tour of Japan.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,I'm following hou to keep updating. I look forward to playing this game.  ^_^
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Sounds like Xidane in FFIX 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,This looks like a very chill game. Sort of like Firewatch was. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Do we have Doraemon in this?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,This looks hella fun

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"Anyone else get ""witness"" vibes from this? Not sure if they both use the same engine or something but i half expected a puzzle to appear in the house lol"

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,I would LOVE this with VR

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,Do your best! It looks very interesting! I don't get the feeling of emptiness like you said some people mentioned... Traveling to Japan is one of my dreams so this looks wonderful.

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-04-23,"To be honest, this is the only game in my life that I want to buy no matter the cost."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Or I could just go outside and see the same thing?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I really want to play this. I'm not really much of a gamer, but I'm a pretty damn anxious person and this looks so damn calming to play. 

I'd probably consider building a gaming PC if this were a fully fledged game"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Cool, more artistic ""games""."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This looks pretty boring...

... as I turn on my xbox to play Farming Simulator. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Is their murder in this game?? 

Also, if I play my cards right, can I sleep with the lonely house wife? "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Most boring looking game EVER
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Who in the fuck would actually play this game

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Loli mods allowed?

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I'd rather not encounter Yokai. I played Nioh
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,When do we get a Pokémon game like this?

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Ohhh~~!!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,But are there any anime tiddies?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This is he worst sounding game Ive ever heard of you should be ashamed for thinking people would play this 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Take my money!!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Wow... ❤️❤️

I think the fuck not, pass"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"But then ur like wait I'd rather have a captivating story and real gameplay, then u go play God of war and delete this game"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Hopefully it ends up being a horror game
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This video needs more zombies
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,A game about micro transactions 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Yeah I've never seen a tweet explode that fast before, seeing the live ""likes"" counter on twitter was similar to watching the bunny town population counter in Zootopia."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It looks great so far! I like the concept very much. Even if it ends up becoming a short game it looks like it would be a lot of fun. Good luck with your studies and this project!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Keep in mind as you gamify your project that not EVERYTHING can or even SHOULD have a specific gameplay relevant reason for existing. For a game's world to feel real, there has to be stuff there that exists simply for the sake of existing. 

What I mean is, every inch of your world shouldn't be houses you deliver mail too. Make sure some of it is just empty countryside. THAT makes the world feel organic instead of like a giant theme park. And make sure the player has reasonable, if not FULL access to this space. Let them go rogue and climb mountains if they want. Put in local wildlife. 

Real life happens all around us as we complete our daily tasks. This has to happen in games too for them to feel right, and a lot of developers don't seem to understand this."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Hey any interest in doing this on pcvr?   
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Let us pet a dog
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It looks beautiful and i am sure you will have great success! 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Honestly... I saw this and thought “wow, that sounds relaxing” and I would absolutely play it as is :) "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I might get this because it reminds me so much of where I used to live in Japan. Lots of these scenes felt so much like I was back there in my tiny little machi. 

Where can I buy it?"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Your game looks really cool so far, and I cant wait to hear more about it in the future"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This looks really cool but may I suggest something dogs or cats to pet and maybe a squirrel or bird to watch.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Don't feel bad! I love this. I lived in Japan for about 3 years and I miss it every day. This game works be so relaxing and make me so happy. 

I wouldn't go into this game expecting excitement. That doesn't seem like what the point is? And that's okay. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I think it's a cool concept personally. Don't let anyone get you down, not everything has to be fast paced action packed. Sometimes slow and beautiful is just as engaging. I like the idea a lot though keep with it. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Boring? I would say calm and relaxing instead, or so it looks to me"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,What are you making this in? Unity?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This game reminds me of Shenmue and I want it so bad 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I am extremely interested 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Reminds me of everybody's gone to the rapture kinda sorta
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This looks awesome for such a seemingly simple concept! Setting a reminder for myself on this one; the art syle, setting and pure openness really have me interested."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hey there, just saw this post and I love it! I want to play it SO BAD! I'm also a full-time college student and you're literally doing what I want to study, so... Good luck! I know it's still in development but it's looking great and please post updates! ^-^"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,If you havent already you should consider setting up a Patreon.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"The art is gorgeous btw, love the graphic style. Reminds me of gamecube games."

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Amazing idea and it already looks beautiful and immersive. Stay true to your vision!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Is the game set in Gunma? 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Do you have a Patreon or some way I can back you on this project? I'd love to see this developed further and would like to test it out! 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I’m always curious how single devs who do this as a hobby while in college can have the time to model. Curious what you use. Blender? Maya? That’s a stunning amount of things to model. How do you find the time. Sorry, I know this isn’t an AMA, but I’m fascinated by how great of a job you’ve done. Cheers. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This looks pretty accurate to rural Japan, really brought me back. I'm certainly going to follow your progress in this. Well done."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hope to see it developed!

May I suggest one possibly interesting feature?

Record some stories from real people around those places around and play them as if they were told us by locals or told to each other. Just to make some changes between meditative traveling and actually exploring the surroundings with other feels than eyes. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Link your website for this, please"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I would really LOVE to see this come out on Steam. I LOVE these peaceful, walking simulator typew games. 

Do you have a website where people can register their interest for future updates?"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I think it looks great and a really chill game. I would try it out! Good luck and keep us posted :D
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Im excited! I saw this gif here this morning, read the description and was hooked right away. Looking forward to more. Best of luck and keep up the good work. :)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I think this looks really cool, not boring. I've been craving a peaceful game where you just wander through a beautiful world."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Is there a VR mode?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I’m so interested in this! It looks so cool! There are a ton of different ways you could take this
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It would be cool and funny if there was a mountain road that has a random chance of having a drift race from initial d happening. Just a thought.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Dude, a Full Metal Alchemist game with this art style would be amazing. It fits perfectly. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Following. Thanks for the invite and I look forward to seeing the final game 😁
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I'm really hyped for it, I really enjoy comfy games, can't wait to see future development and you can count on my support!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It looks beautiful! keep up the good work. I look forward to the release!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hey man, for what it's worth, it totally looks like something I would play. Kind of like Stardew Valley or something, where when you want to play a game but don't really want to *play* a game, y'know?"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I’m looking forward to it. Best of luck. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I really like the look. I don't know if others will agree with me, but I would like to have like a map you have to bring up, no minimap in a corner, or compass. I would like that I have to plan the route I am talking. Maybe even have a map that we could download and print, so we have a map in front of us. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hey, I watched the video, and I was wondering what house the player is in near the end. See, as far as I know, postmen aren't supposed to or even allowed to enter houses, so what is going on there?

I kid, but I am curious about the reasoning behind a postman entering houses (where the spirits and yokai presumably are)."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Man this looks really cool. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Sorry if this question has been asked before. Do you have plans to implement VR into this game? I for one would absolutely love to experience the Japanese countryside through a headset.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It looks fantastic!  Is it VR or flat?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I think it looks beautiful, personally. Seems like it'd be pretty relaxing, too. If this hits ps4, I'd get it in a heartbeat. Even cooler if it's psvr capable ;)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This looks like a fun game to play while high on Cannabis!

As a Canadian, this game would allow me to experience my fantasy of exploring Japan and forgetting I live in a frozen hostile wasteland."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Your “small hobby” is amazing! What engine are you using? Did you make all of those models? Were you inspired by any other games or art styles?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Big fan of the visual style you made. It makes me think of Firewatch, which was really beautiful."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Not every  game needs to have super compelling gameplay. The ability to explore Maebashi again and see where my wife studied abroad would be cool all on its own.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"As a postman myself this look really cool!

Let me know if you want to know postmanly.... stuff.... if it helps!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I love what I see. One question though, are the maps based on real locations in japan? If so, where? Keep it up, I love this."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I am so excited for your game! Is there a mailing list or anything? What’s the intended platforms?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Your project looks amazing! As someone who loves Japanese culture and landscapes I would highly enjoy a game like this. Definitely keeping track of this
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Most important question. Japanese language support?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Your game looks super chill, I can't wait to play it!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hello, please don't take at face value what these redditors are telling you. They are used to loud shooting games and likely have no experience with relaxed gaming experiences or casual games, and in fact often insult and disparage such games.

The emptiness of this game is peaceful and relaxing. You don't have to change anything at all. This is a beautiful game that makes me feel less stressed and complicating the game to make people happy would detract from the unique nature of this game.

Thank you for making a game I've always wanted to play... thank you!!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Followed you. Really like the look of the game :)
I also work on my own Game as a hobby ^^"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Custom mailman socks please :)
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hey man, looks great, seems like a nice calm game to sit back and enjoy, keep it up."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,when on steam? 20 bucks right now 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"&#x200B;

I'm very interested in playing this. Just watching the short video made me so nostalgic for my life in Japan. I was in a fairly rural place and miss it so much. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Love this.  As a garbage man, if you ever need some solid input, I work for an old school type manual labor garbage company where we ride on the back and hilarity ensues. Holler"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Is your landscape based off of kamakura?  It reminds me a lot of that town, just from the short clip posted above."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Where are the people and spirit's? World looks beautiful though, very Gibli."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I feel like the zen-ness or meditative quality of this game would make it worth while.  The nature sounds the introspection while walking in “green spaces”.  Having meaningful connections.  I think it’s beautiful 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I love the idea! I'm a postal clerk myself, so the idea of getting to experience a foreign mail carrier's daily life with some fantasy thrown in sounds great to me."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This looks really cool.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I have a few things to say about this very exciting-looking project!

First, the whole “interacting with spirits and yōkai” part is what really drew my attention - I absolutely LOVE the idea of kind of a peaceful world to interact with supernatural creatures. If you’re implementing a lot of different yōkai, I’d love to see some more obscure creatures in there, like the little ink stone spirits (the suzuri no tamashii, right? I learned about them from Gaijin Goomba).

(What if your bikes a tsukumogami though and that gives you the option to go faster? Although that wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing if the whole point of the game is to take it slow and soak in the sights)

But one thing I am curious about is the location where the game is set - as well as the kind of scenery we’ll be seeing in the game. Obviously there won’t be any urban cities or anything, but will there be mountains? Shorelines? Forests? Hot springs? Snowy areas? Caves with no real apparent purpose in terms of delivering mail, but that you can enter for no other reason than to explore?

Lastly, and I feel this is THE MOST important one - to me, at least.

Please, please, PLEASE make this available for Mac as well as PC. I want to play this game SO BADLY when it comes out, and it’d just break my heart if it was locked to one type of computer I’d have no money to buy.

With all that being said, no matter what, I’m going to be looking forward to this. Good luck, and have a wonderful day!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I'm looking forward to playing this. 

I unfortunately don't have a Twitter, but I hope yoi post updates on here as well. 

What are you thinking about for background music?"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Do your own thing!  It looks beautiful.  I don’t know whether you intend it to be more reflective than anything else but I’m impressed just from that footage and knowing some of your intentions.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I think it looks incredible personally. I’ll be buying it at release for sure. Nice job!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,That seems like an A+ game for improving japanese skills!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"It might just be the fact that's also set in Japan, but so much of the art and scenery reminds me of Studio Ghibli films (the train, Spirited Away, the roads/neighborhood/house, Grave of the Fireflies and Ponyo, the temple, Pom Poko). 

Like I said, it might just be because it's the same setting, but it's very evocative. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Looks like a perfect game for Switch.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This looks so so so amazing, like my dream game! Is it possible to turn off the laggy red-dot crosshair though, kinda takes you out of it. And have you got a patreon?"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Fantastic game! Looks very relaxing, fun and unique. Can't wait to give you my monies :)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I know it would be incredibly difficult as a one man Dev team, but this game looks like it would be so cool in VR. Maybe someone will mod it at some point or Sony will see this and want it for PSVR."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Dude it looks great! I had a flashback to Ninna-ji and the path leading to it, definitely looking forward to see where you go with it! Artwork looks so relaxing, good job"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Please get it to Switch. I love Japan and these scenery really took me back there. I’d love to play it on my Switch.

It looks amazing!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Impressive stuff. Keep up the good work!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I want to play it!  I went to Japan a few years ago and some of the best time was walking around Kyoto with no one really around and being able to take everything in
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Get in contact with Jared Petty. This is a Jared Petty game if I ever saw one. He would be your biggest advocate. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Well hey if you ever need a voice actor for the game, I'd love to help out."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Add VR
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I think would be really cool to see some Japanese folk lore in the game like kappas along the river side and what not
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I am very interested in Japanese culture and would like to play this game you are currently developing. Looks good btw
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Looks lovely! Imo the sounds will really make or break this. I can already imagine the cicadas haha.  
  
Little story.. I was a exchange student to Japan once. My host family did not like temples or shrines so I would go out to find them myself. I came across one called Jakko-in. I walked abooout 2hrs to get there lol. It was up a mountain. I rarely take selfies but I really liked the place and I was alone so I tried to take one. My foot slipped but my foot found ground. I looked back and saw that my foot slipped onto an small ledge and if it didn't, I would've fallen very far down. I thanked whatever spirit was there for saving me from my own stupidity haha.  
  
Went back there 6 years after. There is now a solo ELEVATOR going up for the elderly."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Don't take the criticism wrong. I also think it looks lonely but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The little shot alone gave me a very melancholy feeling, looks and feels really neat. Gives me a feeling I normally don't feel in a game and games are all about giving the player different emotions,like joy, anger, frustration or scary. I think you're doing a very good job! "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Keep up the great work! This looks like an incredible work of art!! =)
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Im honestly so excited to try this game, It looks amazing."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Your game is beautiful; you obviously have a talent for settings and scenery as well as photography if the video is any indication. :)

I look forward to seeing what the interaction with people and spirits will be like!

Good luck!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hi! I think that ambient sound is extremely important for the atmosphere. Make sure you have plenty of long tracks so that repetitions wouldn't be noticable. And splice in some procedural events, like cicada chirpings, bird calls, random insects flying by etc."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Hey Inasa. This idea is freaking awesome and I love it. I love it. Keep at it. I'll buy it. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This seems great! What else can we know about the game? How much will it cost? Where can we buy/download it when you're done? Is there any way we can support you? Keep up the good work my dude!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Already looking good so far
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I would buy it 100 times! Have you seen goat simulator? Its a good example of a fairly simple playful open game 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Not going to lie, I'd still pay for an empty game like this just to be able to explore the japanese countryside, as I myself has never seen Japan and would like to. Hope to see more of this, good work!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Hi, i hope you won't be overwhelmed with people responses. Love your game aesthetic, just keep your pace, and avoid from burning out. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"+1 for looking into VR, this game looks like it would be a perfect game to immerse yourself in. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Ya know what dude, it looks fuckin dope though, nice job."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,お疲れ様です! It looks amazing. Please let me know if you need help on the coding side or in localization or anything. I would love to help if I can!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"面白そうです！このゲームで稲荷様に会えますか?

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Add basic VR support, PLEASE. It's a perfect VR game"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Add AE86, mail drift time /s"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I honestly can't tell you how long I've been looking for a game that just lets you bask in its beauty and explore the world around you without fear that something catastrophic is going to happen. Just being able to go to a place that doesn't make *any* demands of me would be amazing.

Please keep developing this. :)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Seeing the earlier stages can be charming. I would like to support you a bit. No expectations, just free money because I really like the feel of your project and your attitude. Do you have something set up for this?

Edit: I saw through your twitter!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This game looks absolutely beautiful
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I would pay money just to ride that train all day. Can’t wait to see what you do with it!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Boring ?! This looks beautiful and calming.....
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Do you have a go fund me or anything we can do to support? 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Sometimes, you see a game and think, ""Wow, I never realized that was all I ever wanted."" This game gave me that feeling. 

Thanks man, I wish you all the best."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Sometimes boring can be cool, reminds me of how amazing Firewatch was and it was just a suspenseful walk in the woods"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,What is your plan for this game as far as gameplay is concerned?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This looks amazing so far and I hope it turns into something even better. I'm joining your patreon and seeing where this goes.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It got a very Ghibli-ish feeling to it; I wonder if Hayao Miyazaki inspired you?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This looks to be incredibly relaxing, and I can’t wait to give the finished product a try. Well done my dude, keep at it!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I'm extremely happy you got some spotlight,but it's now your reddit obligation to hustle I'm sure we all want to buy this masterpiece when its finished! Good luck and godspeed my friend you're doing good "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Just make the player character a Stand user.


That should liven things up."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"If only we were all that lucky with our interests. Congrats on getting all of that attention, the project seems like it will be amazing!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Now make an adult version simular to ""postal"" as a mod!!  "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Omg so cool! I hope you have the resources to make it as a vr game, it would be awesome!"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Don’t listen too much to people wanting ”more gameplay”, do the game you want to make. I really want more games with less gameplay, and I can’t be alone. I don’t always want challenges, sometimes I just want to explore and chill without having to do shit. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Oh I forgot to mention it's also story driven, so it's not just about wandering around a pretty world :)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,This would look great in VR
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I spent some time at a homestay program in the countryside near Kyoto, and I got immediately nostalgic upon seeing how you've recreated it here. Fantastic work!"

It has become too easy for people to make games that look good, because the assets have become easier to steal, download, create, along with tools that allow you to place them and manipulate them easier.

The actual gameplay is what is difficult because it requires making your own content and programming your own interactions. We will see more and more pretty, but empty games in the next few years."

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"My ex wife was stationed there. I was in Okinawa when I was in, but in the infantry. The marine airwing was there and we spent about 4 years there. Ask her if she went to the oyster festival at Miajima. One of my fondest memories going there."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Firewatch was really disappointing to me in the end because >!it turned out there really wasn't a big mystery or conspiracy at all, just some lonely people living on a mountain hiding from their regrets and mistakes!< 

But I still enjoyed the ride. This game looks really similar aesthetics and gameplay-wise, but I hope it can deliver a more compelling story."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Yeah I had just fully submerged myself into Firewatch and it just ended. The mystery was weak in my opinion too. 

Definitely didn’t do the game justice if you ask me.. 
I could have spent hundreds of hours in that world but haven’t played it since I finished. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Hopefully it'll have a better ending honestly

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Japan's transportation system isn't actually that complex to use. Part of what makes it so amazing is how easy it is. At every stage where something could possibly confuse you, there is always a station agent nearby to help. Even when buying a ticket, there are station agents behind the ticket machines who can [pop out and help.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWf2xGqaH8U It's really great.)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Huh. That's how direction is indicated on the subways in the US city I live in, and I assumed that's how it was everywhere. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Your no brainer explanation gave me anxiety.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I rode JR trains in Osaka and Tokyo in 2003 and had no problem getting around. Biggest challenge was finding my stop on the fare map so I could get the right ticket.

In 2005 I went to NYC and was far more confused than I was in Japan. I'm American.

After moving to greater NYC for 7 years and riding the trains daily, and visiting Japan annually in that time... I still prefer the Japanese system, and find it just as rideable as NYC Transit."

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I've watch a playthrough of it, and I agree for sure. it's absolutely gorgeous, from start to finish."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"oh absolutely, the game has to be well-developed for me to play it more than a few times. this is a mail delivery game with NPC interactions, so those functions should be especially smooth, plus whatever extra features that follow the NPC storylines, if any. 

I guess that's the other thing, it needs to be a fleshed out game, with some sort of story. if you're delivering mail to a mountain town, how does it differ from interactions found in a seaside town? why are you even delivering mail? why would you want to talk to other people? what's the motivation?  "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"This game makes me think of Firewatch though. The gameplay in Firewatch wasn't exceptional by any means, but the story driven aspect of it was."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,i love you both
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"You know, you got a point there. Would probably get a kick out of spotting little details only ""insiders"" would understand. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Maybe it needs more rice
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Automod had flagged it for review because of an edit.

We've since put it back."

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I adore your name. I got to visit a little memorial for jun when I visited Japan a couple years ago and sat there for an hour listening to spiritual state.

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Emptiness with random easter eggs, makes the emptiness more interesting with minimal effort. There's probably enough popular stories that take place in the countryside that you could toss in a few small references with out needing to expand on them or build them up."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Also as much as people love to complain about ""walking simulators"" a lot of people, myself included, love them. Games don't have to be only action movies. A game can be whatever you want, including just walking around looking at things. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Emptyness not necessarily a bad thing, given the context of the game. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,That game has far too much non-interactive shit though. Feels like over half the random house and buildings you find aren’t interactable at all. There’s gotta be a good balance of it. When most of the exploring you do leads you to places that just exist and you can’t even find a story on why their like that it’s a little lame.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Yikes, there are better open world games then that. I'm saying this as a die-hard Zelda fan. I've got tattoos, I've played all the games, I love them but BotW could have been a lot better.

Monsters were MonsterA, MonsterB or MonsterC in different colors. There were 4 small dungeons. The shrines were pretty formulaic. The weapons and items were pretty boring.

They made a fabulous engine and platform for a game with wonderful graphics, physics, world and mechanics but what they filled it with was lacking. I'd honestly fall in love with and agree with you IF the next in the franchise was the exact same game but they spent all their focus on the game story and content."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Unpopular opinion, but I didn’t like Ocarina of Time or the subsequent 3D Zelda games. 

But then I watched my nephew play Breath of the Wild and wouldn’t let him stop I was so engrossed lol "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"you joke but boy this thread is making me cringe.

IT NEEDS MORE LOUD NOISES AND SHOOTING. I NEED TO BE ENGAGED, WHERE'S THE RISK? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE GAMES!! THIS IS BORING ADD MORE HOT TITTY GIRLS"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"+1 for the vr, it should run reasonably well. but since you don't know the system maybe it would be better to do a post launch vr support? 
Looks like a wonderful game either way though~"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Since the project's getting popular earlier than you'd thought maybe you should start a Patreon? People will happily help fund to see an interesting project completed, especially if you keep posting updates as you develop. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Unreal has some very amazing support for VR. This like exactly like a game that could really immerse people.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Oh my gosh that would make it even better. 

GOD I miss Japan. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"You can get a free oculus rift as game developer, I don't know too much about it though."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I would 100% play this on VR. I’d support you!

EDIT:  Thanks for the Reddit silver to whoever sent it to me.  I’m not really a pun person and I thought I would join in on the fun.

I enjoy games like these so instead of giving it to me help the developer out.  Thanks!  Have a great day!"

/u/The_Mdk that's how it works..."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,[deleted]
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Lonely people hiding from their mistakes was the ENTIRE point of the whole game. That was the theme. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I preferred it that way compared to the grand conspiracy you normally expect in such games. It played with your expectations without overdoing it or becoming the sole purpose (like doki doki).
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I agree. Right after I got hooked they jumped 45 or so days into the summer and I knew it’d be too short. 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Agreed. I was prepared to get completely lost in Tokyo, but the agents can instantly spot a confused look, and they are on it."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"it probably is, but for me personally it helped a lot when i first landed here when someone pointed that out to me

i didn’t have experience with trains or subways in the usa"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"sorry

i didn’t explain it well

the big signs will be on the right and left (for the two different directions)

and the major stops, usually near the end of the line, are listed on those big signs.  they telks you which platform goes which direction 

example:  a train line connects boston and new york.  you want to go nyc to someplace in between boston and nyc (lets say cambridge as an example.  i don’t actually know if that’s correct geography).  

you’re not sure if you should wait at the platform on the left or right.  but you know cambridge is towards boston.

the big signs say new york on the left hand side, and boston on the right

so you walk up to the right hand side platform going towards boston"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Yeah, and unfortunately this video was completely empty.  Making lively NPCs and writing/recording scripts for them is actually more difficult than making the world they live in.

Maybe this will actually be a real game that has been fleshed out."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It wasn't me this time! :D
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Wtf so if I edit my comment for a misspelling or grammar it gets removed until you review it?!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Not everyone can afford the cost or time it takes to do that. In a virtual environment you can play the game for a few hours and then go to work or school.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,dude you are man of the culture
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Im a big fan of this concept for games. Those little easter eggs that someone can find just because they're checking an area out is almost magical sometimes. 

Not to namedrop but this was a fun part of endearing games like morrowind. (Only name dropped for reference n figure that its old enough to not be an issue)"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I don’t know, I kind of appreciate it. It’s definitely a slow moving game and that’s not everyone’s thing, but as a personal preference I see enough moving parts to stay thoroughly entertained. "
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,So what do you put above it?
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I definitely agree with you. I just don't see why other people find it the most amazing gaming experience when there was hardly a game to be found. Just pretty scenery.
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Breath of the wild is an excellent game to watch someone else play. When you play you are focusing on your character and the path in front of you, enemies, etc. not necessarily everything else. When I watch it being played I get to pay attention to everything else, the mountains in the background, the random birds taking flight in the fields, foxes sprinting through the grass, the sunbeams coming through the trees. It's such a gorgeous game."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Playing will continue until I'm satisfied! 
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Dude wtf are you talking about you didnt like OoT, MM, WW, TP, and SS?!?!? Those are all masterpieces "

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,It really all depends on how well the mechanics are packaged
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Corrected! I totally meant to say *now,* **not ""not""**.

I love the use of mails and will forever try using it. Forgive my typo."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Thanks!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,Mine worked though
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Yes, I agree. It was just a bit of a let down in the moment. When I found out what was really going on, I couldn't help but feel a little sad that the big adventure and conspiracy I thought I was going through was really just a bunch of paranoid conjecture by the main character, being lead on by some guy in the woods, and that the reality was just him being sad and lonely. In hindsight it definitely makes the story better, but it was a really weird tone shift while in the game.

The game just left me feeling kind of empty, without any sense of closure. Maybe it's just so profound it's going over my head."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"That was the reveal, yeah, but it's not a very satisfying one after the build up."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I'm aware! And I think that the ""twist"" fits the theme of the game better looking back on it.

I'm just saying *after* all the buildup and the clues and mysteries all that, the fact that there was no conspiracy and it was all just him trying to make up an adventure to avoid the reality of his own life, it was a bit underwhelming."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-02,"Same here, I've never had any problems using their system and I didn't even research how to do it before I showed up at the station. You might need an agent to explain things to you at first, but you quickly figure it out and it's sooooo easy after that, especially with a Pasmo or Suica card."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Not inherently.

But automod re-reviews upon edit, and if you throw a link in like this fellow did, it *may* get flagged for human review.

Minor spelling/grammar edits shouldn't trigger a removal."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,What a CatAstrophy this must be for you!
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,You mean I can't buy a moped and drive around the japanese countryside for hours without worrying about work? Bummer :(
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,I’m just left wanting more with so many of the just there places AND the actual interactable places. If they gave me like 20-45 minutes of stupid little shit with stuff like the Devil Cave guy I’d be happy. But in true Rockstar fashion it’s just ridiculously long lists of collectibles.

aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Skyrim, Witcher 3, GTA V, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Dying Light all come to mind as open world games with more interesting stuff to do in them. Shit even Fallout 4 was less empty."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"What u/caveman108 said. I'd say ""Elder Scrolls"" instead of Skyrim as Oblivion beat the hell out of it in terms of freedom to me. 

Id probably add Dragon Age and maybe Mass Effect to the list but that could be pushing ""open world"" criteria. It is fun to play a game multiple times and each playthrough can be completely different...BotW was just more how many shrines/seeds you decided to do and what order of the beasts."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"I wouldnt say the most amazing gaming experience, but a pretty amazing one. The game didnt hold your hand, you to decide what was worth exploring, when, and how. It defiantly captured a strong sense of adventure because of how open ended and up to you everything was. "

We’ve all had moments where we do something that breaks our routine and we get a glimpse of a different life, this game feels very much like that"
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Don't lie, we know automod is just watching videos all day, and when it got this one, it just kept watching it because it enjoyed it so much."
aw4ui2,2019-03-01,2019-03-01,"Well, if you decided that's what you want to do for the rest of your life you can just completely forget about work and pick berries/shoplift for food in the Japanese country side. Try selling people your berries for gas and if that doesn't work maybe find some poisonous berries and threaten them with over-exaggerated symptoms of the berries until they give you free gas. Now this is the way to live your life. If you're threatening them with berries and they pull out a gun, tell them you're from another place and the bullets will just bounce right back off of you and into their skull if they try to shoot you. From my sources, it has worked 100% of the time

It was a great game, it is in the top handful of Zelda games (and I love Zelda games).

OoT and Majoras had amazing ""toys"".  Theme, plot, neat items, locations, dungeons, monsters, etc.

BotW made a fantastic ""sandbox"". The physics, the area, the mechanics, the crafting, control over your own personal resources (health/stam/inventory).

Copy the exact same ""sandbox"" and toss in a year or two of them working on ""toys"" and holy shit you'd have to pry that game out of my cold dead hands."

5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Woof i bet the tattoo owner has a bad face
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Grill on front page calling it now
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Definitely my favorite game app I've ever played
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,I've never seen white tattoo ink look that good before. Almost wondering if this is body paint instead of a tattoo.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,All of my tattoos were magically licked on to my skin by puppies.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Hurtful to some & relaxing stimulation to others
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"You adjust to the pain, it's not as bad as it's made out to be "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Like anyone is gonna look good in their 80's. A bit of colour won't make a shit of difference. 
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Something well done from the original Resident Evil. That game was the turning point for me realizing that games were far more than just games. It changed my outlook on gaming altogether. It was much like playing Mario for the first time as a 7 year old. With that said, something from the first Super Mario Brothers would be equally as welcome for the same reason. 

Edit: scratch that. If I were to seriously consider getting anything, it would definitely be the star ship from Galaga. Without a doubt. The others I mentioned would be a very close second. "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"I dread seeing the amount of tattoos that our generation has once they're older. I don't ever recall seeing a grandma in my lifetime that's sleeved up. It's going to look quite ridiculous. I know I'll get down voted, and that's fine. Comments like mine seem like a good idea in my life right now can be deleted, unlike those tattoos.  "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,did you just call it an app?
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,The company that made this game released another with a similar style not too long ago. It's even better imo
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Nope definitely white ink. Source: having it myself. My brother is a tattooist and has done several of mine with white in them and it looks just like this. Even after almost five years. I've seen others done by him with white highlights in them that also look just like this. Tattoo ink is far, far better than it once used to be. They have a science to that shit today to make it stay the brightness that it is when it's first applied. "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"I tell people that have never had one to super glue a piece of duct tape on to the part of the body they are thinking about getting one, let it set for an hour and slowly peel it off over the course of a couple of hours. This to me is best pain comparison I've yet to think of so far."
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,I think that's not what he meant. The tattoo itself won't look good as it ages. There are a lot of grey shades and they will fade over time. The tattoo will eventually turn into a blurry mess.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"yeah i meant the tattoo, its not like i was commenting on her looks... i cant even see her face in this photo so im not sure how you drew that conclusion."
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,It will look godawful well before she's 80. 
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Ehh, it's not like old people have attractive skin anyway. The tattoos themselves probably won't look great but seeing a tatted up granny doesn't sound terrible, if anything I'll just think she's an interesting old lady "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,I have Vivi and Red XIII from final fantasy on my entire bicep. It may look like shit when I'm old but it's not for everyone else. It's for me. It reminds me of my childhood and all the good memories I have.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Well here's the thing. It's not like my body is gonna be wonderful by the time I'm 70 anyways. And when the time comes it's going to be normal to have tattoos when your old.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,I feel sorry for you if images inked onto someone else's skin has such a personal effect on you. 
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Imagine a girl seeing her grannies wrinkled, faded tramp stamp that says ""insert here""… yikes"
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-25,It's on mobile.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Inside!
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Inside was good but I far prefer Limbo. 
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"I was quoting the original thread on this tat from 2 years ago. :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2blkmh/impressive_limbo_ink/"
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"But the pain honestly fades on an area like the bicep. I got a big Vivi from FF9 and Red XIII from FF7 and there was only a slight pinching for the first 20 minutes or so then I had to fight sleep because I couldn't feel anything but the buzzing. I feel like this testing like this would just suck.

Now when I got my Velociraptor Sherlock Holmes on my calve I spent the whole time debating whether should just grip the chair really hard or bite it."
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,Via black magic 
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,But you GOT the tattoo to be unique...
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Yep and to add to this, who cares man. We all end up the same anyway. Live while you can. I'm pretty inked and have no regrets. Do I look at some of them and go was that smart? Then I'm like fuck it, I'm dead one day anyway. Fuck what other people think."
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Please, I can only get so erect "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,">Inside!

Of what?"
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"I thought Inside was disappointing, personally. I adore Limbo"
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Like I said that's probably the closest comparison I could find and yes some places are far more painful than others, my bicep was a breeze but my chest was a much different story, right next to the armpit and middle of my chest especially. "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-24,"Nah.    
-Guy with tattoos "
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-25,The outside!
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-28,By God chest was painful in not just the chest area but I felt like the pressure points right behind my ears were being stabbed. Causing my head to ache as well.
5k1gnk,2016-12-24,2016-12-28,"O Ya the old displaced pain anomaly, that'd be a good ELI5 post. I always wondered why that happened."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,sold my xbox years ago and now I kinda feel bad for my man; im pretty sure I left him in a chicken suit too.... damn I did you dirty avatar.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,I remember having 20 friends from high school online at once. Now it’s a ghost town
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Every so often I'll boot up my 360 to play something and I am greeted by so many sleepyheads and it's like a mini existential crisis.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Poor LongPole420, may he rest in peace"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Kinda random, but shortly after the avatars were introduced there was a program (maybe Netflix? It's been a while, I forget) where you could sync up with your friends and watch movies together, Mystery Science Theatre style, with the avatars emoting and whatnot. Definitely miss the days of groups of online friends watching shitty movies together and chatting during the whole thing. Does something like that still exist?"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,This was sadder than I thought it would be
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Fuck I miss seeing my baby brother get online. Fly high bubby.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Well my xb1 profile pic is my 360 avatar so I guess he lives on.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,The *real* question is: which one will be the last one awake?
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Because they're on the xbox one now? I just had to remake mine so it didn't look stupid for the folks looking at achievement progress. My avatar also now rides a unicorn, as one was available."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Just like the Mii avatar, these were cool, but weren't properly supported and served no function.  At least the Mii avatars made it into some of the games."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,That will be all of us one day.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Bought one from a friend and it had all her kids in a row sleeping forever.  Had to del asap
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"I was a avid online gamer during the 360 era. Had dozens of friends who I could play with no problem. From like 06 to 2011. But after 2011 real life happened, followed by sporadic bouts of homelessness. And because of that I missed most of the Xbox one era. After about 2012 it would be almost 5 years before I started gaming again in 2017. But by that time I couldn't find any of my old friends on Xbox One.  I still had fun, but it clearly wasn't the same. By late 2018 I had to pawn my xbox because financial difficulties reared it's ugly head again. Hopefully by the time the new xbox come out I'll be better situated and build up a even better friends list....hopefully."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"I remember in High School a bunch of us from school would play Gears 1, Halo 3 MW1 and 2, etc while picking up new online friends along the way. Always had a party chat going once it was implemented, always had countless people online. But, after high school some friends moved away, others stopped gaming while some just straight up vanished over night. I moved to PC when Xbox One launches and luckily found cool people on Discord, but that era of Xbox Live brings back memories. When I fire up my 360 I find myself looking through the avatars wondering what those people are doing now."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,This is sad af
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Thats legit hurts me
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Still have my 360, but haven't booted it up in a few years. Have some fond memories of gaming playing BFBC1/2, LFD2 and countless nights playing COD zombies with friends.

To this day I still have my profile pic and avatar from 360 days and I don't think I'll ever change them."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"PC gaming is well alive with discord and steam etc. Move to PC... I feel bad for lost online friends...... Sucks, sucks that people quit gaming. There is really no need to quit gaming."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Most of them could wake up again one day, maybe they buy a Xbox Scarlett (Or whatever comes after it) for their kids and play it themselves once the kids are asleep. The really creepy ones are from people who have died, those ones won’t ever wake up and it kind of stings. Steam tracks the amount of days someone is offline for and it’s always weird watching the numbers go up"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,I still use my 360 occasionally for NCAA Football.  I still see people on their from time to time but most of them are long gone.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,That is scary on a few level.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,I remember staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning every night playing Halo 3 custom games and MW2 with friends from school and a close friend we made in the Halo matchmaking lobby. Most of them barely play at all anymore and when they do it’s on computer. Luckily we’ve kept in touch and remained friends over the years. I’ll never forget all the good times and laughs we had. Best years of my childhood.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,The xbox 360/ps3 early days where such a great time for console gaming.  I really do miss those days.  Back in the day when you actually had good FPS games that did not rely on micro transactions and loot boxes.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Greatest console of all time
LITERALLY fight me if you disagree, I have a ps4, but when I had my 360,*MMMMMM*"

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,I think Microsoft set the limit of the xbox 360 for 20 years. You can set the date up to 2025 on the system clock.

It's nice seeing everyone in one place again, especially knowing that two of us are in different states, two of them never want to see each other again, and two of us have a strained relationship."

I remember we would play Minecraft like there was no tomorrow, I even remember this one time we made a flat world made entirely out of TNT; we spent weeks trying to make it and afterwards we just blew it up. I remember we used to play Castle Crashers and Bomberman all the time too. Those were the good ol' days :')"

I remember that, for almost a year, we solely played Halo Reach. We would especially focus on Forge mode and see what weird creations we could play/create. We bonded over those times. We would talk about everything and anything and we were always there for each other. Two whole years of my life were spent with those great memories. Now we barely talk and neither of us play any games. One of us is a firefighter, another is an engineer, and the last one runs his own business. No matter how hard we tried to keep things intact, we just never had the time."

I was even part of a clan for COD but slowly over time they all stopped getting on. Now they always remain Offline. Only a few get on occasionally now and it’s to watch Netflix. Now most of my friends list is made up of people who don’t get on anymore but I refuse to remove them because of being good friends in the past and the memories.

I also attempted to use the new avatars but I feel like no one really looks at profiles now like they used to on 360 so I didn’t think it was worth the time."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"I moved around a lot as a kid and xbox live really helped me make friends with kids at school. Still to this day I talk to some of those old friends (23 years old now). 

In the 7th grade I moved to a new school in a different state during the middle of the school year. I had zero friends and ate lunch alone for what felt like the longest time. It wasn’t until one kid said, “hey do you have an xbox?” That I made my small group of friends and stuck with them until I eventually moved again after freshman year of highschool. Some of the memories I cherish the most are coming home after school and playing cod 4 with those guys nonstop. We all always planned to get the same new games that came out and played co op or online together for countless hours.

One of those friends passed away during my sophomore year of highschool. I vividly remember the day of his funeral and my mom letting me take her car to drive to it. I still get on xbox every now and then and look at his profile, last games played, achievements, etc. 

RIP DeathFromBacon"

Leaning on one leg, with the other leg outstretched like they're trying to reach something with their foot.  Somebody who has zero skill at 3D modeling decided he didn't want characters standing there like they didn't have any pose at all, but the outstretched-right-leg look was the only thing they could come up with."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Y’all ever think that this is happening again, right now? An entire other generation of middle/high school kids, gaming together daily, entire days over weekends and summers, all so this can happen to them in the coming years?

It’s a weird thought."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,Anyone remember when you could go on Netflix and watch movies with friends and your avatars would watch together. I miss those times.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"I used to have so many real life friends that had 360 and played COD World at War that I didn’t have to worry about having anyone to play with, but rather which group to join.

I think out of all of them, two of them still play video games at all."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"50,000 people used to live here...."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,I never had that many but I did have a decent handful of online friends. Sadly most have gone there own way. I see 3 of them on my friends list now but they all play on computer and I have yet to get one. Also I took a 6yr break due to life and tried to reach out to one of them but he never responded. Feels weird try and reach out to the others now. I feel like I'm forgotten.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Man that hit me right in the feels...oof
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,I'm still friends with an account that has been inactive since 2007. RIP my friend I wish I would have know what you were going through.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"The majority of mine were on PlayStation but a good five of us were Xbox, it actually made it so much better because it was easy for us to fit in the same game. God I miss those days sometimes, I still play from time to time but rarely longer than an hour."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"I have 27 friends online right now and I went to high school with 13 of them. At least 20 of them I can put a name and a face to, the rest just random Overwatch/Apex adds. Doesn't take too much to reach out to people and add them, but it also helps to have had the same Xbox tag for like 12 years"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,What the hell happened here?
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,Mines isn’t exactly a ghost town but we did go our ways (occasionally talk though). One of the people we played with tried to murder (I believe he was mildly successful unfortunately) some people at his college with a knife so yea we all pretended we never knew that guy
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"It's weird I used to play COD 4 with all the jocks from my HS, we never spoke at school though."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,Me and my friends used to play in high school too but they all died
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,They all wised up and went to PS4
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"They moved to ps4, switch, and pc(which is basically a better version of xbox). Because xbox sucks now."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,Going through the usernames and just remembering when and what you played

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Yup it was Netflix. That was the best. It went away pretty quickly which was a bummer. 

1 vs 100 was the bomb too. Really sad they stopped that so quickly."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,You just gave me so much nostalgia. I miss that feature a lot. I have yet to find anything like that in the modern age.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"I remember this it was Netflix and they had you in a theater setting with the other avatars, it was fun to talk about what we were watching like we were in mst3k"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"You can do that in VR now. BigScreen is probably the most popular one around and worked very well for my son and I, even over my crappy LTE connection.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"I was on my PS3 the other day looking at the friends I had on PSN, none of my high school friends had logged in for over 2 years except one, for whom it had been 23 months. Made me feel a bit sad."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Up to about a year ago I was still playing Der Reise fairly regularly online. About 2.5 years ago I met this British dude (I’m American) and we hit it off pretty well. All he ever did was play Der Reise. When I saw him on, I’d boot up W@W and we’d own some zombies. He hasn’t logged into his account for “over 24 months” now. I am sad."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Yeah same, now I see their usernames and they are either using Hulu or Netflix, never any games"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,yeah crazy to think back on those days. i never had internet but my friends did and i remember like 1/4 kids in the class would be on at any given time and we all had the same schedule and free time at night. nostalgic
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"When I was a kid I kept telling myself ""video games are my life! When I'm 55 I'll still be playing video games!"" I just turned 24 and they just don't do it for me anymore. I thought there'd be a super dramatic event that just tore me away from them but without all those people on, like back in the day, there's really no point (least for me)."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"This is so true, I used to have average lobbies of 8+ people in custom matches. It's amazing how quickly that all disappeared."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,They prostituted us to the west.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"I moved to another country but every weekend my friends from back home and I would meet on XBL and play games for hours.  CoD4, MW2, Gears, Halo 3 etc.  

Then slowly they seemed to forget about me.  Sometimes I’d show up and they had full lobbies.  I’d wait to play and sometimes they never freed up room.  Once when I was back home visiting we made plans to hang out but suddenly my friends said they’d be late.  The reason was they all took a drive out to one of the shops in another city we had always hung out at and lost the time.  They didn’t even invite me even though I was free all day waiting for them. They just simply didn’t consider me since I hadn’t been physically part of the group for so long. 

It all came to a head when Black Ops was released.  Like every game, we planned which game we’d buy next to keep up our weekend gaming sessions.  I had to buy because you can’t rent games in this country.  We played once and everything was as usual.  Then the next weekend I log on to see my my friends playing Madden or something.   I waited for them to finish but they played all night, continuing to say they’d be done soon.  When they were done, they were too tired and going to bed.  The same thing happened the next week and the next.  

Finally I asked what was going on.  They said they really didn’t like Black Ops.  Surprising as they loved everything CoD thus far.   But they insisted that they had no fun at all playing it. This was just before winter holiday so I told them I was planning on traveling to a big city where I’d be able to sell Black Ops and get a little cash since it was still new.   They said to do it because they were done with the game.  I was disappointed but I’d rather get a little money back than keep a game that I’d never touch.  

After the holiday, I got back to my apartment and went on XBL to see if maybe they’d like to play an older game we all had.  My friends were all online... playing Black Ops.  I was confused.  I sent a message.   They said while I was away they decided to try it again and NOW they realized it was fun.   They told me to join them to which I reminded them that they told me to sell the game and I had.  They said maybe we’d play an old game together later but they were really enjoying Black Ops and didn’t want to stop.  

I saw them online playing it every weekend for the next few months.  I stopped messaging them and eventually we stopped talking at all.   I was completely forgotten.  I became a non-entity."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,They might be using the show me offline feature. When I started making accepting friends from destiny pick up groups the contestant messages to just drop in when I was playing some other game. Easier just to show off line:
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"This is how I felt about AIM.

I ran AIM until the day it shut down. Not because many people were active on there, but because I had a plugin for it on my website and the phone app, and it was a great way for people to reach out to me when they find my site.

It was a ghost town with all my highschool friends permaoffline :/"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"I was on my Xbox 360 the other day and then I remembered I had no money to buy a new system and also no friends, made me feel a bit sad."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,If any of them got a PS4 they should still be active. But then again they may have just stopped playing... Sad days man.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"This is me now. I'm 28 and back in 2010 or so, I would work, come home and game with everyone I had just saw at work. Man, we did that so frequently. Now, fast forward 9 years later and I switched to PC and kept in contact with two others. One just had a kid and they're never on. The other hasn't been on Steam for well over 2 years or so. I feel like either I'm the last of my friends who games, or someone who should just move on from gaming. Maybe a mix of both."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,I removed a ton of people I haven’t played any games with in a long time. Most were last from MW2 and BF3 days. Either were not on any longer or just used xbox for Netflix etc. It was kinda cathartic honestly. Rather have a small list of gaming people versus 30 watching tv.

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,This is rough. I moved to a new country too and this is my fear.
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Damn, this really sucked reading 🙁. Your ""friends"" sound mad flaky, I feel for you.

I think the best thing we can do is always focus on the positive. We may be forgotten, left behind, get to busy, or even find new friends, but we can always look back fondly on our happier memories from our childhood gaming experiences with old friends."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Yeah i can’t buy games with the intent of playing with friends anymore. Too many moment likes this, and im talking about friends i still see, still talk too, and still game with regularly. They just can’t seem to make up their minds. They told me to get the division and we played one night, then they were always on, id invite and jump in their lobby, then they would kick me or something. Then the other friend, same shit. Then i saw them playing with each other, id hop on and they would kick me. Said fuck it. Sold the game and unfriended them on xbox for the longest time. Pretty sure they never even noticed lol."

d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,"Literally my entire (full) friendslist was from Black Ops 2. I stopped playing cod after that one, and so did most of my friends. I used to have 50-60 people online constantly, yesterday I booted up my 360 and had 1 person online."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,"Seriously amazing. I grew up going to my friends house across the street to play gears 2&3 , halo 3&reach. So much fun. The halo soundtrack makes me feel something lmao"
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,I never played Gears 1 during its prime but I met my a long lasting group of friends I had for three to four years during Gears 2. Group of adults who weren't full of shit and treated me nicely. Most of 'em are gone now but I enjoyed the time I had with them a lot during gears 2 - 3. I had a different group of 'friends' throughout my halo 3 career. Unlike the first part of this comment though I voluntarily dropped contact after they kept acting like asshole children with ridiculously cringey attitudes. We went through legendary together but not much afterward. Had to do Reach with an entirely new group.

I understand people mean well when they say things like prayers and gods got a plan, but honestly they are just hollow words at this point.  Sorry  for the tangent I do truly appreciate your kindness internet stranger.  May happiness find you and  yours as well. Also don't be afraid to tell that person in your life how you feel.

I remember playing Resident Evil 2 in the dark with my friends and getting scared shitless when the birds broke through the police station glass wall in that one hallway."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,">sitting in front of a CRT TV

I love that this is actually a crucial detail in telling a story about the 90's, back when 27 inches was the desirable size, because anything larger would be like moving a refrigerator. I also remember when there was a brief period of 16x9 CRT's that had DVD players built into them, and that DVD looked like HD on those screens."
d7eju9,2019-09-21,2019-09-22,I agree 100% and it makes me sad in a way. Those were some of the best times I had when I was younger. I realize if I ever have kids they will never be able to experience that

I think I had one friend from MW/MW2, whose name was some variation of rockstar that I had on fucking Myspace of all things but that died around the time my focus on console FPS did.

We moved it to the basement of our first house, where it sat for 5 years.  When we were moving out, we posted a bunch of stuff to a free cycle group. One guy came with his friend for a bunch of furniture, and was interested in the TV... until the 3 of us tried to move it.  He decided to leave it in the basement.  Needless to stay, the tv went with the house.  5 years later, the person who bought from us sold the house.  We went through the photos on zillow to see what they changed, and that tv is on the same tv stand in the same corner we left it in."

But at that point in my life (around Like 12) I didn’t have any social media, and was too afraid to give my number out online. 

Now I don’t care, I give my snap to random people I just met in overwatch, and my steaming discord with almost 100 people has my number in it.

We put it on a plastic sled and took about twenty minutes getting it up the deck to the sliding door before we realized it wasn’t going to fit through that door. We had to drag it all the way back around and get some neighbors to help us lift it through the front door. I think they just got rid of that TV last year.

ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,This game gets the babes going. 
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"I did the whole game in one sitting with 5 deaths or less. I'm familiar with it.

*Your girlfriend is a good artist, and she should be happy about it.*

She also has big tits."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Awesome, yet creepy. Exactly like Limbo!"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Limbo was on sale on Steam yesterday (it might still be?), so I got it. I must admit, the first 5 minutes of the game freaked me the fuck out... When you first run into those bear traps and it just snaps up out of nowhere I literaly jumped and stood up from my chair for 30 seconds before I sat back down."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,I was feeling shitty one day when my friend called me and invited me over to his place to play some games. Never have i laughed so much over getting killed..which was ALOT.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"I haven't played Limbo, so I will *never* understand what im looking at."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Limbo was so engrossing, fucking loved that game!"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Whoa, deep"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Can I has? :D
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Here, have the comma you are missing in the title. ,"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-31,"Man. Your ""girlfriend"" sure seems depressing."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Hang on and I will let you know later. 
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,[And if you're not familiar with Limbo go buy it now as you're missing out on a great indie puzzle platformer.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/)
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"If there's one thing I dislike on reddit, it's pandering art posts like this one. ""Look at this piece of art my friend/buddy/son/mom/dad/girlfriend/boyfriend made. please upvote it!""

If the art is good, then let it stand on its own. If it has to be propped up with simplistic, manipulative cliches, then it doesn't deserve to be upvoted."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,This game is great! and so is the picture! I like the effect of the ink. Everyone who haven't played this game should do it. The history is original  and the gameplay is interesting. I recommend it.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Are you in need of medical help is my first question?
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"[But, he is already dead](/spoiler)
"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Nope, just graphite and ink."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Yeah, I'd like a girlfriend too."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,So amazing it's been posted before.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"I don't think she's made anymore based on games, though I'm sure she could. Maybe I'll tell her you guys would like some more."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,YES! That is a fantastic idea. 
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"I'm calling this an advertising topic.  Limbo goes on sale and someone happens to post an anonymous painting about Limbo on Reddit.  Inevitably someone else will comment that it's on sale, and even if they don't people will see the game, check steam, see it's on sale and decide to buy it.

The user has only been a member for 12 hours."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,IMPOSSIBRU!
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,I see what you did there
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,*Somebody's* single!
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Can I ask you how else he should have put it? He would lie if he told he made it, and when he doesn't mention who made it people would ask who did anyway. "
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"In all fairness, he could have painted it with his right hand."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Seriously this shit is annoying as fuck. How is it that every greasy ass acne ridden gamer has a girlfriend who has nothing better to do with her time than make shit for him? Seriously Reddit shut the fuck up. At least make your lies more convincing and say your friend did it.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Seriously I would buy something like this. . . .

As for the game, I've never checked it out but I will now. "
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"I never understood this. If they did it, they might get more karma in recognition of their efforts, not their ability to nab a talented girlfriend. "
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,You should try it out. It's on sale on Steam and it's super cheap on the Xbox 360 Marketplace. It's an indie platformer puzzle game. Super fun....but super depressing. Play at your own risk. 
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,I'm pretty sure I've played better freeware flash games... that lasted longer. Not worth the $2.50 I spent on it.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"I didn't know you could get this effect with graphite.. sure looks like watercolor. Oh well, in any case it's very well made! I think this is my favourite fan art of Limbo so far."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Awesome, has she done anything else like that?"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,When? And the source of your information is...?
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Great!
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Worked for me.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"haha, opened steam right after i saw this post. "
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,WindSandStars = Meg Griffin
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Somebody's making irrational judgements about someone they don't know with little evidence!
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,SO seems to go better around here.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Just ""drawing"" :p"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Well guys. I hate to say it but my girlfriend did 
make this. Not for me, but because she liked the game. And I'm no greasy ass acne face gamer. I'm a well-kept lady who thought the good folks of /r/gaming would appreciate this."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"She didn't do it for him.  She prolly got a creative vibe and started painting. I don't know if you have a creative outlet, but most of the time you just dont churn out shit like on a treadmill. You get an inspirational blast and get to it. Her boyfriend then saw the work, appreciated it, and uploaded it to reddit for points. 

TL;DR He didn't say MAKE ME A PAINTING BITCH "
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,But internet points!
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"The game was good, but sadly not long enough, you'll get through it in less then 3-4hours. if i remember correctly, it might be even less.
Its good and full of surprise, i dont know anyone who didnt like it."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Recommended. Fun puzzles but it's the atmosphere that makes it. Makes one good night alone with the lights off and with headphones.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Because the Reddit hive mind is more likely to upvote something that a girl made.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,I'm not sure why you're getting down voted so much. I think that you're correct.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,I happily spent somewhere around $8 when Limbo first came out. 100% worth it.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"These are two others she made. Not game related, just self-reflective pieces. http://i.imgur.com/n48lE.jpg"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Got me too.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Didn't you just do the same thing?
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Well I *am* on the internet, after all!"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Then people would ask 'who made this?' He'd respond 'my girlfriend' and he'd get as much shit as he does now. Conclusion, people should stop whining about it, it's not hurting anyone."
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-31,That's fantastic still! :0
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,So now it's a casual-gaming lesbian couple who like to paint shit. Whatever fuck it.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,Sounds like what I'm doing tonight
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,OP is a girl too. Your logic is flawed.
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,"Cool, I really like them both a lot. I'm surprised by quite how impressed I am by the floor on the bottom one. Really imaginative stuff, thanks for sharing. :D"
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,It's hurting all of our hearts Stickill. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND STICKILL? ARE YOU SO BLIND TO OUR FEELINGS **STICKILL?!**
ubkaj,2012-05-30,2012-05-30,No prob. :]
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Limbo: The FPS.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"LimBorderlands. Where you fight demons from your past on your way through Purgatory. 

I'd play the shit out of this."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"This is actually just a visualization of the depth buffer using [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) and [Depth3D](https://github.com/BlueSkyDefender/Depth3D) (just to enable the depth map view). You could probably do this with any game that allows depth buffer access (ex. games on [this list](https://github.com/BlueSkyDefender/Depth3D/blob/master/README.md)). 

The depth map view can be enabled in the shader's settings. Your mileage may vary! I would try to play Borderlands 2 entirely this way if I wasn't playing through it for the first time. Also, I don't think it's possible to play any game entirely in this mode because there are definitely moments when there is no depth buffer (ex. menus).

Edit: On a hunch I found out that some awesome people have already made this shader for [Dark Souls](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/3ctk65/working_on_a_limbo_mod_but_with_full_gui_anyone/) a year ago.

Also for kicks and giggles I found that this technique works in [Fallout 4](https://gfycat.com/PoliticalUnfortunateGrouper) as well.

Edit 2: [Here's a comparison](https://gfycat.com/SentimentalMistyArieltoucan) of the effect with and without the depth map view enabled. (I disabled the shader during this clip because I was dying)

Edit 3: I found that [another awesome Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/3g6jf9/limbolands_2_borderlands_2_with_limbo_mod/) has done this for Borderlands 2 a year ago as well, although their video doesn't seem to exist anymore"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,No HUD? I'll use this handy dandy infinity pistol!
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This is seriously terrifying.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"It's sad that even without color, hud, or sound I still know that's Tiny Tina's Fleshstick side quest in Tundra Express played by Axton using a Dahl infinity pistol."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,**every indie horror game**
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"FYI: It's the depth buffer displayed without any other channels. The further away from the camera a pixel is, the brighter it is displayed."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This looks fucking awesome! I'd play it this way 100% sure
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,[deleted]
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,It would be hilarious to start a playthrough with this dark theme all serious like just to have claptrap and handsome jack start cracking corny jokes

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"That went from a comedic, explosive triple A fps to a pretentious indie game about how horrible humans are or something. That's a neat effect."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Without color*
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,All you need to make it perfect is the Bane.

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,I like how you're using the infinity pistol just so you don't have to worry about the fact that you literally can't aim or see how much ammo you have left
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Do you mind telling me how you made this happen? Looks super sick and I really want to try running borderlands like this now
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This just looks like the depth map.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Horror Lands 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,did i play too much borderlands that i instantly (even before the shot of the house) recognised it was at Tiny Tina's place?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Ive played so much borderlands 2 I know exactly where he is and what mission he is doing. Its the one where you go find that Doctor that drops the Infinity gun. If im not mistakened its also the gun he using or just a repeater. The second clip is probably the mission where you have to burn the insects or he is just prancing about the area.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-20,"This could easily be released as ""the hot new indy game"" and people would have no idea."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"ITT: ""I'd play the shit out of this mod that makes the game look legitimately worse"". 

I'm all for a tone-shift in the colouring, but this is just removing colours and everyone else pretending it looks nice.

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Its like LIMBO reimagined as FPS
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,It's like a first person action packed Limbo.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Reminds me if Eidolon
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Nice infinity pistol
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,The game would probably a lot scarier this way if you used something else than the infinity pistol. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,So you're just playing it through the ReShade depth buffer?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,That looks a lot scarier. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,that is horrifying
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Dude, Limbo is scary as shit in 3D"

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,You can also use depth maps in conjunction with a normal video to add Depth of Field to videogames in editing.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Is there much of a modding scene for the Borderlands series?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This reminds me of that game where you run through the forest as that child and get caught in traps and stuff.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This would be fun projected on a building at night.

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,That Depth Buffer.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,That's a D3D depth buffer output
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This is looks like someone turned Limbo into a FPS
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,The Infinity is so awesome.  Gunzerker with two of them and in the gunlust spec and a bee shield did so much damage.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,I heard that Borderlands was originally going to have a super realistic look almost like Fallout but they decided against it because Fallout was already so successful. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Thank you for not referring to the game as Cel-Shaded. That's an argument I grew tired of quickly.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Awesome. Would be a great mod for Left for Dead.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"This is an awful meme, great mod though!"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Is this the Tea Party mission?

Having played literally 1000s of hours in borderlands (I played 1 and 2 to completion on ps3 then bought the humble bundle on pc and played BL2 more than I should have), this would make it even more fun to replay. Once I graduate this is happening!"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"A friend of mine has a couple beta levels of it before it got cell rendered.

Completely different game.  "

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,It's driving me nuts that he isn't looking down his sights. Look down your goddamned sights!

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19, Can someone reverse it with the colors and the HUD for comparison?  
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Does applying this type of effect have any noticeable performance impact on reasonably-powerful rigs?

I know I had a lot of issues with using ENBs in Skyrim / FO4 and ultimately abandoned them in favor of smoother game performance.


That being said, if this doesn't effect the performance of BL2 I might reinstall and replay the game this way because this looks rad."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Nailed that potatoe toss

There is a black and white version of the new film in case some people don't know."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"That buttery smooth 60 FPS too, to this day that game chugs on PS4 -- turning into slow mo in some sections.  And the moon expansion game, that shit crashes to ""desktop"" every time I play it on PS4."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"At first, I thought this was gonna be one of those terrible memes like,""were number one but everytime they say one its hello kitty instead"", but this is legit. I want this feature so bad."

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Wish this was a setting you could turn on and off in-game. It would make it way more enjoyable, for me anyway."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,How do you do this?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"I'd play it sober, drunk, and  everything in between

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Yea, but who uses the infinity"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Wait. What EXACLTY is this? Because you won't get this gradient from dark to light just by removing the colors.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,The part where the dude got lifted in the air looks a lot cooler without the effects.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"The part I didn't like about Borderlands was all the backstepping when fighting things.  Everyone wants to come up and melee you and in order not to get hit, you have to either kill them before they get to you or walk backwards while you load your gun because guns don't have large clips and you suck at getting headshots because the enemies move to erratic and guns don't do that much damage when hitting the body so you waste ammo missing or doing no damage and have to reload.  Then, the respawns...what?  Give me *at least* 6 minutes before respawns.  An hour would be good, imo."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Well now I wanna see a dark game given cartoon-y colors.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,you mean borderlands with just the Z-buffer representation? 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Not gonna lie: that looks absolutely terrifying. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,I think you mean depth buffer. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"This should completely change the feel of the game, as if you've only payed $5 for it and it's indie."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,this looks like a Z-pass (depth pass)
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Anyone else here ever do the 'Evil Smasher' glitch?

I think that was the most fun I've ever had playing a video game, especially after grinding for so long in that game and being barely able to beat bosses.

Evil Smasher glitch + infinity pistol... so goddamn amazing. "
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This is a game I didn't even know I needed.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Infinity...Must not be playing on anything higher than normal.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"basically a depth matte
"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Mod or settings?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"I'd play the shit out of this, I'm all for minimalism in shooting games. I flipped my shit the first time I played SuperHot but that's more of a puzzle FPS than a full on FPS."

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"I tried to get back into this game, but the frame rate and graphics are pretty dated, are there any mods that make it look nicer?"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Is this a mod or can you just turn down the saturation and turn up the contrast enough to get this result? I've never looked at the settings. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Can you mess with settings and do this?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,This is a depth matte. 
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"that's a z pass. Passes are buffer images used to make some calculations easier in rendered images. For example, this z pass could be used to calculate atmospheric perspective (Objects further away fade to the sky color because the little sky particles in front of you start to add up). The whiter the pixel (closer to 1,1,1 rgb) the more the shading color gets mixed with the sky color. 

It's called z pass because normally Y is the vertical coordinates of a 3d world, the x is the side to side coordinates and z is the depth coordinates. 

If you have any questions let me know. I'll talk about computer graphics all fucking day"
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Whaaaaaaat? Do you have a video link of this?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,That's just called a depth pass
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Couldn't you do this with any FPS?
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"I think you meant to write that they just isolated the depth pass

Edit: yep... You wrote it in the comments. Oops"

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,That's a bit more than just without bright colors or hud. It's without any color at all and what looks to be more fog that usual.

The Sims 4 (but only after messing around in config files to disable the built in AA and DOF)

Euro Truck Simulator

American Truck Simulator

Cities: Skylines

Train Fever

Transport Fever

GTA IV

I guess technically you could reproject the depth buffer on both eyes (similar to TAA or shadow mapping) but that would result in some ""missing"" pixels for objects that are too close to the camera (which you can then fill in from surrounding pixels). Essentially it's impossible to do without some visual artifacts. It actually doesn't sound like a stupid idea, I wonder how that would look. EDIT: also that wouldn't work on a scene with translucent surfaces. EDIT2: for those interested it's called stereo reprojection and it's a well researched topic.

Every games uses different depth buffer settings, and it's not hard to remap the colors to something more fitting."

For integer values, the distance distribution of the values is also usually logarithmic(ish), so you get more depth detail up close and less in distance.

Borderlands' busy and exaggerated sound design worked really well with it's own bright and colorful aesthetic, I agree with that completely. "

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"tl;dr: If a piece of gear has red text, try it out before scrapping it.

I've got around 4000 hours into Borderlands 2 and a big piece of advice I can give is that if a piece of gear has some red text flavor text (such as in the case of the Infinity saying: ""It's closer than you think! (no it isn't)"") you should always try it out. 

Red text on a piece of gear means there is some special property to the piece of gear that might need some experimentation (or looking up on the [wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Borderlands_Wiki)) before seeing it's true potential and uses it may have. 

Some unique effects are pretty good such as a pistol that has it's shots split into multiple shots (effectively being a shotgun) or an SMG that has moderately low base damage but does amazing critical hit damage.

 Other effects are not as helpful and some are even detrimental. But that doesn't detract from the fact that red text items have special and unique properties.

Red text effects can be found on Unique weapons (blue rarity items that are often given from quests as rewards or drops from bosses) and Legendaries (orange rarity items that can drop from practically anywhere but certain mobs have a higher chance to drop a specific item such as Doc Mercy dropping the Infinity).

Don't also get too sentimentally attached to your items if you're not at end game level. Even if it's a sick Legendary that helped you out time and time when you first got it, it's not worth using over a blue or even a green that is a much higher level. Once you severely outlevel a gun, it's garbage. Alternatively, you can hold onto it and transfer it to a different character for them to use when you start a new playthrough with them.

One last thing I can suggest immediately for a first time playthrough is turn on subtitles and if a character starts talking because it was triggered by a mission turn-in or progressing in a quest or area, don't do anything else (if you can help it.) Dialogue can easily be overwritten by other dialogue and there is no way to resume/playback already started dialogue. Far too often characters will cut each other off and you could miss out on some of this game's beautifully written script.

If you're interested in more details or have any other questions, let me know via comment or PM. I'm always open and happy to share information and guide a new Vault Hunter.

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"There are a few different projects out there such as VorpX and Vireio that attempt to support VR rendering as broadly as possible on games not built for it. The best supported games use ""geometry"" 3D mode meaning they actually convince the game's engine to render the full scene geometry for each eye.

The fallback mode that works on almost anything is Z-buffer 3D which, as you said, sort of works but has funky artifacts. It winds up looking a little flat as though near objects are cardboard cutouts instead of being fully 3D. Generally this effect is not compelling enough to try and actually play the game without a UI, pausing to vomit during cutscenes, etc. But it is pretty cool to see."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Actually, CryEngine used to do that for their 3D glasses support. They simply interpolated the missing pieces in screen space. This was done to avoid having to render the whole scene twice.

I don't know how The Climb handles it right now, the info I have is from a presentation of theirs from around 2010, long before VR was a thing."

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"Indie = lazy-college-kids is a great circlejerk and all, but that's not why you don't fight back in horror games.

In survival horror, removing your ability to fight back greatly increases the tension of the game and the environment you find yourself in.

Most games, all you need to do is aim your biggest weapon at the baddie and click. That removes all sorts of stress and tension, which is great if stress and tension aren't that important to you, or if you can achieve them by other means (eg stronger enemies).

Good horror puts you in a situation where you can't fight back because that's the most terrifying thing of all is being helpless. Silent Hill and Resident Evil are both technically horror games, but allowing you to fight back takes away from the helplessness. They're spooky, sure, but not actual horror. Outlast, on the other hand, terrified me... biggest reason for that is that I couldn't just bash a trigger button to make the problem go away."

Once you severely outlevel a gun, it's garbage.

There are save editors available which you can use to change a gun's level. I wouldn't recommend it for spamming awesome guns as that defeats the point of the game but it's fun to try here and there. They are also great for changing classes without having to grind back to max level, or to match levels with a friend to play online."

I ended up hiding in a locker, which the monster looked close at it then checked the one right next to it.  Well the monster walked away and I start walking back only to realize he hadn't made it that far. Monster chases me again, I hide in the same locker, monster checks locked right beside me.  This happened another two times after that from my impatience. Every time I'd run to the very same locker, and every time the monster would just check the one right next to me.  I had to quit after that."

Why wasn't God of War called a Ninja Gaiden clone? NG came out before God of War, and has most of the same ""ideas"" behind it as far as the action combat goes. 

For that matter, Castlevania: Lament of Innocence came out in 2003 and, same thing, has most of the same ideas behind it that would go on to make God of War what it was.

I'm sure there's more games going back in the years before 2005 that have the same play-style, but what did God of War do to earn the title of ""the first action-platformer with combos""?"

They're all a little shaky on what games are and aren't playable though, and tend to require some semi-monster level hardware. At least from my experience.  I remember comparable issues when PS2 emulators were becoming a thing. 

Edit; Because my first example was trash; [RPCS3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTLqPA_lCmY) as one example can play non-high end PS3 games. Translation of hardware is still a massive issue though due to the infrastructure differences.

5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,Secret Ending Explains everything.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"I recommend looking up some theory videos. SPOILERS. My favorite theory is that the current state of the nation is one of fascist regime. Under this regime, all sorts of scientific studies can be performed. The government decides to start experimenting with control. In the beginning, you walk through a farm with pigs and such. They were the first test subjects. After that, a facility was built to test the control on humans. 

The rest is entirely speculative. 

The large blob at the end that you play as is a hive mind. After the control experiments, the scientists wanted to compound intelligence and control it. I believe that the blobs intelligence is so great hat it actually powers the whole facility's mind control schemes. It is connected to the same/similar nodes that you interact with to control people in the game. I think that the boy is an experiment as well for security purposes. As with any artificial intelligence, there is the risk that it will want to free itself. I believe that the blob is 1. Attempting to free itself by controlling the boy to break into the facility or more probably 2. The boy was placed in the woods by the scientists and the hiveminds task was to free itself as part of an experiment. It's possible that this experiment has happened many times. The facility seems to be falling apart. Could it be from the hive mind escaping multiple times? Or is it because of the mermaids? We will get to that in a second. Near the end of the game you come upon a museum display of the exact mountain and beach you fall down to in the finale. It seems strange that it is there unless it was planned. A final question to answer before we move on. How can the hive mind reach the boy with its mind control from so far away? Well, the secret ending gave us the his answer. The nodes that are throughout the game work as modems for the blob. It can control the whole facility through them. When every node is destroyed, the boy turns off. 

Alright so the mermaids and the description of parts of the facility. I think that in attempting to make the hyper intelligent blob/hive mind, there were failed experiments. The mermaids are them. So that part of the facility was garrisoned off and only to be accessed in a submarine by certain people. The mermaids caused more destruction around the facility to flood it, so as to navigate. It is clear that the mermaids must stay in the water.  Orrrrr, the mermaids are part of the security system so that outsiders cannot enter through insecure entrances. I doubt it because building a huge facility then flooding it makes no sense. Especially when consider the point of the hive mind is to create intelligence for a post apocalyptic fascist regime. Which brings me to my next part of theory. 

What is up with the shockwaves? Alright so there is very little to draw from here. However, I think it likely that some sort of apocalypse happened in that world or nation which eliminated much of the population. The facility was trying to recreate those conditions. Orrr, the regime was developing a weapon that used shockwaves. It's a government facility. It's possible multiple studies were being done there. Perhaps military as well. 

Alright, well if anybody else has any interesting thoughts please share. "

People don't think that way though. We'll pick the most recent, prominent example, and in this case, everyone knows God of War, so that's what people go for. It's how we end up with people calling Darksiders a Legend of Zelda clone even though they're two very distinct games."

Pick one. Their game engine is basically a middle schooler's science fair potato clock compared to modern titles. "
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,I would assume so.
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"there's less limitation technically, especially for the xbone to be ""emulated"" (which could probably be just little more than just running it's OS as a VM), but I doubt that neither Microsoft nor Sony managed to not think this far ahead. Just how many games require *some* kind of connection to the Internet, through either platform's respective online service, at least at first install? I'm betting there's something there that will prove the biggest barrier."
5ovezo,2017-01-19,2017-01-19,"I have no idea. Everything, I guess. It's a hell of a game. I don't even do all that much, I just fly around the world, take screenshots, tweak things, maybe get my Sims one or two new outfits, and that's 90% of my time in The Sims 3."

xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,good luck getting over that chimney
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,"Not bad, but the buildings should be pure black just like in the game.
Maybe you could put a few white spots for windows? Also, the buildings are sharp but the character isn't, which looks a bit odd."

xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,Immediately thought of the Godspeed You! Black Emperor album cover  
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,Not bad.. not bad at all.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,Still haven't beaten that game its so hard.....good job..
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"can you guys fill me in on Limbo? all the art i see it looks pretty legit.

edit: googled+wikied how had i not heard of this before?"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,It seems like all of Illinois was storming last night..
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,New wallpaper. Done.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,Creative and original - more of this.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,Nice dude.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,"Glad someone else liked the storm...

Though here, north suburbs, sky was a freaky green. "
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,Is that taken from a platform at LaSalle station?
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,Looks like DayZ on <1000 blood. 
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"I like it, but the detail on the building on the right kind of breaks it for me, seeing the perspective and all."
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,Excuse me for saying this but fuck that game.  It is so fucking depressing.  Give me something upbeat to play instead.  
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,i was on lake shore dr couldnt see shit..
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,I really like this a lot
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,I just moved to Lombard from Florida. I'm used to storms like last nights however it must look very cool in the city.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,OH NO YOU DI'UN!
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"you know, why hasn't anything about fez gotten to the front page? i think it's better than limbo ^-^"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"Fellow Chicago Redditor here, where was this taken by? Love the picture by the way"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"Look out for that...nevermind, you're dead."
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,You're bad ass. I love this.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"Great shot, who else thinks there needs to be a sequel?"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,I know exactly where you live now.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"high five man this is amazing 
"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,neat
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,maybe im alone on this but I think it'd be cooler without limbo addition.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,And instead of your sister your trying to rescue scruff mcgruff.

xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,"Thanks for the critique! I tried keeping it as close to the original as possible, because it was a pretty badass storm in itself.  Here's the original for reference:

http://i.imgur.com/8NCIU.jpg"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,I finished it last night. It just kinda... ends. You may be far closer than you think (I didn't think I was 3/4 done).
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,It's pretty fun but sometimes gets annoying cause you will die lots and lots due to the fact you don't know what's coming and literally cannot adjust on the fly.  It's mostly pretty easy with a few incredibly difficult puzzles thrown in.
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,a bit further north in River North
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"Up in River North.  I won't say exactly where because, well, I live there and it's the internets :)"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-07,"that's fine, I'm moving.  say hi to the new tenants for me, though!"
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,Changing contrast is fucking mad skillz

xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,Thanks for the source. Always enjoy large city-scape weather pics :D
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-06,"Just played through it all the way today. Pretty good game. I wouldn't say that any of the puzzles are incredibly difficult (I thought a bunch of the Portal 2 puzzles were more difficult). One of the puzzles took me forever because I thought that the ""gravity switch"" was just an arrow sign so I never tried to interact with it. It's those kinds of things that bothered me about the game, as well as the ""LOL you just got pwned by that spike!! Now do it again and this time easily avoid the spike! Congratulations bro!"" That kind of thing doesn't reward skill or problem-solving ability."
xq09h,2012-08-05,2012-08-05,"Ah, OK. Just looked familiar!"

v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"I just made my brother a fallout 3 shirt using the same method; Let me give you a little tip with that lettering, especially in the ""B"" and ""O"". 

Keep it the way it is on the stencil, with the little...gah, I dont know what they're called...tabs, I guess, holding the inside of the letter intact. Then, once you iron the stencil onto the shirt, carefully (CAREFULLY!!!) use your x-acto knife and cut those tabs away. Then, once you bleach, they will look like normal letters and not a stencil. 

Take it for what it's worth, just throwing some advice your way. "

v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Oooh, fuck I'd buy that so fast.

edit: Maybe I'll make one too :D"
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Do you have the stencil? That's pretty neat.
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"That looks amazing, a little surprised you did it in orange though."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,You've got to start mass producing these.
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"i would like to announce that throwing money at the screen does not work.

HOWEVER, throwing my credit card and wallet into the disk drive, well.

We have yet to see, hm? HM?

god damnit that looks great."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Love the shirt. I think I would look really cool without the ""Limbo"" too."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Looks badass!
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Oh man, I want to make this too, mind if I try this as well?"
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Pretty cool, but I've got to ask doesn't bleaching make the fabric frail and tend to rip?"
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Don't know why I read Homomade...awesome shirt :)
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"How do shirts like these look after a few washes? Do they need specific cleaning instructions? Do they get that washed out appearance? 

Really interested in making my own, but I want to know if this look will last."

I apologize..."

v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Nice work
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,I love that! 
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Looks good BTW, and normally I despise the splatter effect on bleached shirts, but you did it just right. Good show.

EDIT: how did you get that spray? was it just a heavy spray point blank?"
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,The O looks like the  cerberus logo XP
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Wow, that's really awesome! I really like the ""glow"" around the dude."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Way awesome! I want this shirt, but I also want to make it myself! This may be my Summer project."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Do want, i keep seeing these bleached shirts on reddit, i will defiantly have to make one"
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"read that as ""lemonade limbo shirt"" for some reason, then i looked at the pic, and saw that it had kind a lemony color, and decided it was a fair description."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-17,"This is one of the few bleached shirts I've seen that doesn't look absolutely shitty.

v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Why does the t shirt have yellow print not white?
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,There's a game about doing the limbo? Who would make a game of you going under a stick? 
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,I have a question. Why is Limbo so popular now? What caused this? I remember when almost nobody had heard of it...
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"It's cool and all, but I feel the ""sprayed"" look takes away from it.  Just my opinion 2 cents YOUR SHIRTS SUCKS DOWNVOTEEEEEEE"

v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Well that just blew my mind. Thanks for the tip!
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,[deleted]
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,I use freezer paper that's ironed to the shirt. Check out /r/bleachshirts. They have all the tutorials to get you started. It gets to be quite addictive!
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Thanks!
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,That's actually just the colour the shirts come out as when you bleach them
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,I'd say go for it! Maybe try and add some foreground.
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Well I use the shirts at work because they're cheap and easy to make. So far I haven't seen one rip. I don't use a lot of bleach either. 50/50 blend with water does the trick.
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"haha, Well if you're an honest redditor you dont wash your clothes anyways."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,I just gave it a light spray actually. Spray to heavy and it causes the design to bleed past your stencil. Lighter sprays usually make the stencil look sharper.
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,Doo iit...
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"It was just featured in the latest Humble Indie Bundle, so lots of people who didn't play it before are playing it now. Me included."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Humble Bundle, I'd reckon. I remember getting it on Xbox Live when it first came out. I suppose it's good that the game's getting the recognition it deserves."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,What would be better? Glue and glitter?
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"Ha, Half the fun is making the shirt yourself. But, if anyone is interested in a shirt, feel free to pm me."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,no problem. Best of luck to your future shirt making. and may I suggest /r/bleachshirts?
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"BTW [here] (http://imgur.com/tLdcW,cixbk,L93aX) is one of the shirts I made my brother. not my best but it's the only one I have a picture of."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,it's just one of those things you learn along the way. I'll post a pic of the shirt I'm making once I' m done with it
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"it can vary from dark rust color to a sickly pale yellow. It depends on the bleach/water ratio, soak time, etc."
v4piz,2012-06-16,2012-06-16,"I was actually thinking of mixing bleach and water in different bottles to make different ""shades"" and try to replicate either [this](http://www.creativeapplications.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/limbo05.jpg)  or [this](http://www.toomuchzerging.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/spider-cavern.jpg)

v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-17,awesome ;)
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-17,"Hes gonna love it, awesome drawing dude :D"

v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,What's he doing with his penis out? I am not the only one right? 
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,That is very cool dude. Great idea and execution.
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,But...but the kid in the game is dead.
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,And then the spider got them.
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,You then both get decapitated by bear traps.
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,And then one of you tries to impale the other.

not a slant against the OP. just the commenters  "
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,"Wow..just, WOW.."
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,did he molest you or whats the point of this thread?
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,"Last night my 3 year old made me stop playing fable 2 when he woke up, all grumpily demanded that i exit to the xbox main menu, pointed at the games option and made me go through every game i had and he kept pointing at limbo. I started a new game and got up to the spider part  without dying. The tv is connected to some speakers with a subwoofer so every time the spider would hit the ground it would make him jump. He wanted me to play the game to walk around in that world, he just doesn't want to know anything about that spider. I had to stop playing the game as i know it gets bad from then on. 

He's a weird kid, he would play katamari for the xbox but only to walk to the center of the stage where all the cousins dance or to watch the game movies over and over. Or he makes me play civilization for arcade just so he can listen to the characters talk in that weird language. 

Loves freakyforms for the 3ds, loves mario. I think he will be an obsessive gamer."
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,That is hauntingly awesome!
v6shu,2012-06-17,2012-06-18,"Limbo doesn't seem like a very good choice for 'feel-good' art. I've said this before, and I'll say it again, but part of the reason Limbo was so good was because of the bleak, hopelessness of everything, which was all accentuated by the bleak, grim art style. Adding hugs and flowers and love [which I've seen before, not only here] just takes all of that away; it neuters it.

But hey, if he liked it, then more power to you."

There's something about the long dark winter nights and settling down in front of your PC for a Skyrim session. 

Fresh hot coffee with biscuits. You sip it as you check out Breezehome and your various mods for it. 

Once in game you turn off all the room lights and wander around hearing the virtual fires crackling in the tavern and the bard singing stupid songs.

Then you head out into the night, enchanted sword at the ready.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Valheim does it if you're willing to put the effort in to make it yourself
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Dark Souls 2 AKA: Cosy Souls.

Majula is impossibly cosy, the music, the vibes. As long as you don’t go near the small pigs.

Also fun fact, if you kill the pigs enough times eventually they become larger pigs then if you kill those enough times they turn into one giant fuck you mega boar mini boss"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,No world of Warcraft? The alliance cities looked really cozy
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"When playing Red Dead Redemption 1 I would fast-travel back and forth(I think, been awhile) to change the weather to a rainstorm then I would sit in a saloon and play poker.

That was cozy."

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,He unintentionally ruined a TV thriller tho. Tom McKay who voices and looks like Henry turned up as a nice innocent fringe character and I immediately knew he was a wrong ‘un with a much greater role in the plot😁
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Ever tried Valheim?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,well I would say LOTRO had very nice interior design on houses/taverns
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Outer Wilds starting planet of Timber Hearth, plus the DLC world of The Stranger.

The art design was based on US National Parks so it has a real rustic feel to it."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,This might be controversial but this is the only thing I liked about Skyrim on lion did everything else better including exteriors
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,haven't found any with the same touch and feel so far. except for among trees having a nice (but not in the same way) atmosphere aswell.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,The music and environment on the ship base in borderlands 3 to deposit weapons and buy upgrades was relaxing.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Kingdome Come. Maybe not so much cozy.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Asgard’s Wrath sure delivered on that style.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,i made some pretty cozy homes in ark and other survival games if that counts
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Is there anything quite as cozy as Hogsmeade?

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,'Skyrim: special edition' was pretty close
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Witcher 3 has some good locations

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Valheim is very similar. In fact, I'd go out on a limb and say Valheim is like a sandbox parody of Skyrim. Of course, they are both very different, but they do have numerous similarities."

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Far Cry 5 REALLY does this for me. Sitting back and fishing in that game, just experiencing the world. I wish they had made a better game, cause it came so close in so many ways, while still falling VERY short in other ways.  

And the whole ""Merica"" vibe WORKS for me. Taking an outpost and getting that music and setup of everyone moving in and setting up. MAN it just works so well for me... Ok. I gotta go play it again!"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Horizon Forbidden west had that one tavern in the beginning that was hella cozy. A little smoky due to the huge fire pit in the middle but I'd love to drink a pint with the boys there.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"A bunch, but Skyrim does it really well!  

In addition to what's written below here, a good portion of sandbox games capture this feel when you have the ability to build your own place - since it usually takes the form of a cabin with dim lighting."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Metro 2033 had some unironically cozy subway towns
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I mean, Witcher?"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Has there been a good rpg since this?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I am currently building my home at Lakeview Manor. Nothing beats the firepit in the floor.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Witcher 3 definitely had some houses or Inn suites that I would walk in and go, this is pleasant...I wouldn't mind living here."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Valheim does this very well
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Majula in Dark Souls 2 is definitely one of these places for me.   
Even though it looks kinda sad."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Idk but the (almost complete) absence of unique tavern and inn designs definetely destroyed my immersion.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Not so popular, but Gothic3 gave me the same feeling"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,Kingdom under fire: the crusaders gave me that feeling in the towns. Plus the game was a great mix of hack and slash and tactical combat. Soundtrack was on par with doom too.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,The whole series really. Have your up doot
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I played the crap outta that game! Loved it!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"He asked ""like skyrim"" not surpassed it by immeasureable amount"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Praying to Avo that the reboot is good!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,What I wouldn't give to live in the fable universe.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Loved this one! Was so much different than any other games I’ve played. Can’t tell you how long it took me to figure out not to just run in hacking and slashing. Great story though, have been really considering a second playthrough soon."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Jesus Christ be praised!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I'll have to look into that one, it's come up a few times."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Masterpiece of a game. One of my all time tops.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,This is what came to mind for me too. KCD nailed the medieval atmosphere like no other game.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"There were only 3 RPGs that kept me engaged enough to finish them, and KC:D was one of them. Absolutely looking forward to part 2."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I wanted to like this game so bad but SPOILER!!

Once i got the the part where guards are killing everyone and you are running away from your house to the next town, something had to have gone wrong with my game and spawn a guard up my asshole as soon as the cutscene ended and i just die no matter what. Killed the game for me instantly."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I really want to play this but first person games give me motion sickness :(
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,Agreed as far as atmosphere goes I would say Kingdom come Deliverance is close to the top
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Agreed but the reason I like it so much is because it gives me a feeling of being scared in the woods.  I don’t think any other game has done that to me.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Same, loving every moment of it.  I’d say it’s much more war torn than cozy but Novigrad is fun to spend time wondering around"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Absolutely. I started playing it recently and my first house I’ve made is the coziest house I’ve ever had in a game
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I always liked oblivion more, and it's definitely because they had an actual hand to hand skill so you could go through the game punching everyone in the face and it was effective."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I actually just started it yesterday! I haven't played it in I don't even know how long. I'm loving it.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"My favorite game of all time

It’s really special"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"This is definitely that same coziness..

Something about running through the black forest in the pitch black of night while its pouring raining grabbing thistle as you go; and seeing the glow from the eyes of all the goblins.. you slay them and reach your cabin while you sit next to a cozy fire and eat..

Has a certain ambience to it. I love it!"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"My first thought too!

Loved making my homes cozy"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Awesome music too
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"It's surprisingly in-depth. Early on, I discovered that you need to create a proper fireplace with chimney inside your home or else you'll die of carbon monoxide poisoning. There's a neat smoke simulation in place.

You can get away with having an open wall next to your bed and the fireplace outside and with a little roof over it to shield it from the rain, which is my go-to solution for little emergency shelters away from my main base."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Came here to say this.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Actually tho. It is.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Came here looking for this comment. Such a great game!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Glad I didn’t have to scroll far for this.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Is it still fun solo
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I was hoping this would be the top response.

To truly appreciate the warm and cozy, it needs to be a refuge from the real cold outside.  ""Cold outside"" in Skyryim is just an aesthetic.  In the Long Dark, limping to a shelter like this I can *feel* the warmth of that fire place as I slap down a freshly carved slab of raw meat and hear it sizzle.  It feels like life, because it literally saves mine, as my blizzard-soaked sweater finally starts to dry and my shivering stops."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I'm inclined to believe you!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Love me a good shader.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Any shaders you particularly recommend?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Classic
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"These comments are making me want to try Oblivion. I haven’t managed to get into Skyrim, but do you think it would  be worth the try?"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"It's honestly far less grindy than most survival games, but whoever decided the copper ore drop rate should be anything less than at LEAST 75% should be fed to the Fenrings. At least Mistlands sort of remedies that problem by letting you collect copper scrap from ancient weapons and armor."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"There’s a mod that adds enchanted items, like Diablo style - great addition to the game."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Excellent game! Music and atmosphere were top notch!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It’s like a place right out of a storybook
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It helps that all roads lead there
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Sometimes it seems all roads lead there.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I feel like they could have recorded just a couple more lines given how many times we go there in the game and the character says something about it. But yes, it’s like something out of a fairy tale."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Can you imagine traveling there before they invented floo powder?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Those rocks have seen better days
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,That's in my backlog! I'll have to bump that up my list!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Took way too long to find someone saying this lol
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Maybe not traditional cosy, with the most unique houses in elder scrolls, some of the most unique in any game really. But checks out"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,jk's breeze home with lux and embers is incredible
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Nothing says ""cozy"" like running from a maniac with a shovel lol"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"The witcher 3 is also set in a war torn world? If anything, witcher portrays that war more vividly. Dead people hung on trees, burnt down houses, battlefields etc. Maybe the art style allowed a more bright look, but I would argue the world is way more gloomy and dark than skyrim"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,that's why i'm still waiting for skyblivion :(
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Witcher 3 is also war torn and feels a lot more gloomy and dark than Skyrim ever did. Do you not remember Velen?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,How is that? I've never heard anything on it.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,You have to play archolos then
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Making that soup was such a cool mini-dungeon.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It does! I would just sit in a tavern and people watch!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,(spider man pointing meme)
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I understood that reference!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Hell yeah!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Oh god I can hear the music
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,That's a great choice!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,the witcher youuu?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,People like to shit on this game but your little settlement village in it definitely captures this vibe (and you're there A LOT so it does feel home-y)
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Came here to say this. Despite it's age the atmosphere really holds up, especially in it's custom stories."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I upvoted the latter. RDR2 is not cozy as in the place but its people & lore & NPC mechanic would give a tremendous amount of coziness.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Was about to say this
In terms of atmosphere theres no game like it"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,"Bruh, it's never too late!"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It certainly is a very interesting aesthetic!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Do you have a favorite?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I suppose that is fair lol
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I unironically love that game so much
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"He said cozy and rustic, not corroded and rusty"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Can't feel cozy if you get attacked by trolls
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,F that place
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"There’s always one creepy mission in each of the Thief games. Thief 2014 did an insane asylum and it was pretty good.

I love the briefing to that mission:

The Shalebridge Cradle. It used to be an insane asylum, and before that it was an orphanage. One night a fire started, no one knows how, and after that they left the place abandoned. If there's a way to cram more misery into one building's history, I can't think of it."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Someone with taste :3
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,"Honestly I never playes skyrim 😅...I saw people online playing it and for me that whole journey is too much.I like games that last as long as possible,but I just couldn't start that one in particular"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,I'll pray to Skorm just so we have all the bases covered
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,"I hope so...I remember when I heard about prince of persia (it was the first one I think?)...I was freaking out.Then they said it will remain the same,they just remake it to have better quality.I would accept that for fable 😅"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,"I don't know why,but whenever I hear fable I remember the first time my bro showed me the game,and he was like ""Look what I can do!"" and he kicked a chicken and it landed on a roof...for me that was amazing that you could do that in a game 🤣 (I am an animal lover,so no hate here 😂 it was just completly unexpected that you can interact like that with the environment)"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I was really enjoying it but the sneaking mission ruined my enjoyment a bit. I want to replay it and finish it but it takes so long to start
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Really? .. I always thought of trying it but the gameplay keeps turning me off from getting it.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Just be careful. Your character isn't the invincible chosen one or someone with a destiny. He's just a guy
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"FYI, if you have Xbox it is currently on sale for $6 on the digital store. Not sure if it's on sale on other platforms, but might be worth taking a look soon instead of putting it off to check."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"This game really gave me the feelings again when I played Skyrim for the first time... It's obviously not as fantasy like, but their is insane attention to detail. It's really a simulation of living in the middle ages! Also there is sneaking and stealing, so that is a win in my book :')"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I saw somewhere its going to be remastered or enhanced or whatever. So nows a good time
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Hey, Henry has come to see us."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Haha. Worth the revisit. Second go round can probably get through to there faster. And then you get the full experience at just how comically crap Harry is at performing the most simple of tasks.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Kingdom Come Deliverance does a really good job at selling night time.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,play the forest
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,try elden ring too
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,There's no first person in the Witcher so it's a bit different too
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I love that feeling, so long as it’s one in which I also feel powerful enough to combat what might come out of it. Not big on Subnautica horror styled games, since it’s mostly a helpless fear. But a “this shit is creepy, I’m not sure I wanna know what it is, but I do know it doesn’t want to fuck with me” feel is for sure my vibe."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"The wind blowing through those trees gave me anxiety. The Witcher is an ugly, depressing world. ☹️"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Would Darkwood count?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Maybe it was just the dabs on dabs on dabs that accompanied my playing that made it seem more cozy
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Skellige is my favourite place to spend time in.
(Except when sirens are around, those are quite annoying)"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,x
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"One of the other things I miss about Oblivion, vs Skyrim, is the acrobatics skill."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Skyrim you just get a khajit, disenchant gloves of the pugilist, get the heavy armor unarmed skill, and spam smithing and enchanting until you become a punch god"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"The scaling system in Oblivion just ruined it for me, but thankfully there where mods that came out eventually to make it playable. One of the worst ideas to ever happen to RPGs is scaled enemies. What is the point of getting levels and getting stronger when everything else levels along side you?

Skyrim had a lighter version of this which made it a lot more enjoyable to me. But even it needs mods to be truly enjoyable."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"If you want more of Skryim and Oblivion you're in for a treat -- check out Nehrim and Enderal on steam. Both free and both complete new, well-developed games that are mods of each of those"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Please try talking to everyone in town and finish their related quests. I played both of them and I still feel that Oblivion nailed the story better than Skyrim.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"See that’s what I liked Valheim for when I started really playing it for the first couple days but then my main home got raided which is where all my equipment and materials are. I rushed over to it and got obliterated, then kept spawning in the Black Forest where I continued to get obliterated. On the off chance i escape the Black Forest, I get merced at my main camp. I just gave up because I couldn’t enjoy the game anymore.

Is there something I’m missing? I was really confused why that was happening to me."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,And you actually get rewarded for making them cozy!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"The music, while good, is honestly so repetitive that it gets tiresome quickly.

My solution? 35 hours of Nordic folk music (Wardruna, Heilung, Danheim, Gealdyr, etc) in a Spotify playlist for normal play, and my Amon Amarth playlist for the boss fights (their song ""Shield Wall"" was used in Valheim's first trailer)."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Then upvote and move on
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"You're right, without fear of cold there is no true coziness. That's why I tried to play Skyrim with mods making it survival with harsh, cold weather, and it was an excellent experience. The game wasn't that easy anymore, as some places were too cold to just run there without specific gear and making campfire often. I recommend trying it. As far I remember, the most important mods were iNeed, Wet & Cold and Frosftall."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Cracking open a can of soup…
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"This is one of my favorite games. You don’t respawn, the cold kills you dead!"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,Not OC but I've been using Complementary Shaders and so far it's been the one I've been happiest with.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,I use seus ptgi to mimic RTX (it's not actually RTX) I love the lighting and overall tone and mood it sets
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,yes! oblivion has a much more fantastical feel while skyrim feels a bit more harsh and rugged. both are beautifully different experiences
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"It depends on what part of Skyrim you couldn't get into, Oblivion does certain things better and other things worse."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Yeah I would suggest a texture mod but otherwise Oblivion still holds up very well overall.   Definitely has a richer look and feel.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"It's by far one of the more grindy games. I've played over 100 hours and never got past the 3rd boss. Each boss will take at minimum 10 hours of grinding, much more if you want your friends to have armour too."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I still remember my house in the village i had with my friends, we used to hangout there because i set up a table and was making drinks for everyone."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Off on another adventure are we???
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It would be quite inconvenient.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"As a Skyrim enjoyer, I really like DA: Inquisition. Visually holds up well, yet old enough to be silky smooth on any modern hardware. A+ characters, and a pretty well-written storyline"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Yeah, even a side quest where you protect soldiers cleaning up a battlefield before they rise again and start attacking."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Especially the first act of the game, the landscape is literally destroyed by war, locals caught in the middle, small poverty stricken villages barely getting by, freshly fought battlefields... it's bleak af! It actually throws some players off at the start because its so desolate."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Well keep waiting, I feel like I've been waiting on release news for 12 years now."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Velen is just 1 area, but the weather and climate wasnt as dark as Skyrim. Places like Skellege were darker, but still not as dark/cold feeling like a lot of places in Skyrim."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It has some pluses and minuses over Skyrim.   I like it.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"It's just another themepark MMO.  You run to a guy with a yellow thing over his head and click through the meaningless quest text.  You then press M and walk with your map up, ignoring the surroundings to go the dot on the map and kill the 6 things and repeat 500x."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"it's one of the better MMOs out currently. Usual problems of lots of expansions so it costs a lot to catch up (especially if you buy the dungeon DLCs), or you can just pay the $15/mo for ESO+, which unlocks all of it.   


Combat's fine, enemies are spongey but it's an MMO. classes are all really cool and the character creation beats Skyrim's.   


it's also cool being able to just straight up walk from one side of Tamriel to the other."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Personally I think its extremely boring, but some people enjoy it."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Surely. I've been meaning to do it for several months now and I'm sure it will be a great experience. Do I need to buy Gothic 2 Gold from Steam or g2a or other platform and then download the free copy of Archolos mod from Steam?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,oh yeah the yeti mansion. that was a good dungeon
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-03-09,Yea I figured ppl wouldn’t like my answer cause it’s horror game but it’s the first game that came to mind when I saw these images. Glad you agree!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Do you mean the one in Sasau?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It's great.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"And a pretty dumb one at that, oh but we love old Henry."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,That’s why this game is so great. You actually feel like you’re learning and getting stronger as the game goes on.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Until he learns Master Strikes. Then he's feeling quite hungry...
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Hey Henry's come to see us!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"According to isthereanydeal.com, a Steam key is $9 on GamersGate and $20 for the Royal Edition on GamesPlanet."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"War Horse recently put out a 5-year anniversary trailer but I didn't see that they were upgrading the original in any way. That's cool!

I also had heard that the developers were taking a vacation to a certain castle that some characters were going to at the closing cutscene of the first game, so the rumor mill is definitely that a sequel is in the works and, with any luck, not terribly far out."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,One of the few games that gave me nightmares. That and Subnautica.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,The new one came out today
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I played that with my friend in VR.  Fuck that shit.  He had the nerve to try and convince me to get Forest 2 the other day.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"See Elden Ring didn't give me the ""scared in the woods"" vibe nearly as consistently as Witcher 3. I think just because the woods in Witcher 3 are like, 80% of the Velen region. But you know where Elden Ring really did get that vibe? Liurnia of the Lakes. When you're walking through those misty woods and you hear that soft ringing of bells? And when those howling multi armed monstrosities appear out of nowhere? Yeah that was awesome."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,That would absolutely contribute
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I love the castle in the northern area, I spent an absorbant amount of time just looking over the vistas from the balcony’s"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,But I need help. How do you defeat the first boss? ;-; how much progression is required for it?
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I too loved to jump over the cities walls and see the other side not loaded in.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I miss everything they removed from Oblivion to Skyrim a little less than I miss the REAL fun shit they removed from Morrowind to Oblivion.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Just

Also in oblivion you could do it while invisible without having to jump through 30 hoops to be able to do unarmed damage"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,+the heavy armor perk to do the armor rating of gauntlets in extra unarmed damage
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"In my opinion, Enderal captured the ""cozy"" feeling even better with its level design, where inns actually feel like a place you need to visit and recover."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,A house is not a home without a beehive.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Have you ever been to an Amon Amarth show tho? My face literally melted. So good
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"This is my one of my go-to valheim tracklists [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Al0QXzRFF8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Al0QXzRFF8) (""you're high on mushrooms in the viking age, the gods are everywhere"")"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,No.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Spell casting and bows are significantly less fun to use in oblivion than skyrim imo.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"From what I remember it was mainly the nonstop looting, weight, inventory design and I think lack of colors. I did not get too far in it, I think like hour, max two in. And I think I got lost on my way to some mission xd"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,That with Rust and Metin 2 are the most grindy games i ever played.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,WhAt aRe YOu uP tO nOW??
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I just finished the 2nd one. Inquisition is next!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Origins will always be my favorite, but inquisition has the best companions in my opinion."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Bro they announced like a couple weeks ago its coming in 2025, there's a trailer, gameplay and everything"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,lol I wish more characters were like old Henry that lovable oaf.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I'm hungry
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Hey, it's Henry! Henry's come to see us!"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,The combat was very engaging until I realized you're penalized for attacking first and using up stam. Pair that with passive ai and it started to become a slog.

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"SOMA.  It will invade your mind and rattle you in ways you never even considered.  Nightmares, daymares, existential crises...it's all there."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I remember being scared of the Octorocs in OOT back in the day, so as much as i wanna play Subnautica I can't bring myself to do it lol"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Played it for 8 hours yesterday. Had the hud on the back of my eyelids before I fell asleep.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"It is not consistent as Witcher, but it is different, in different areas. For example the Liurnia Woods with the bells, the Altus Plateau woods with the caughing Wormfaces, the Caria Manor with the ""surprise mf"" vibe, any catacomb with that creepy music and the silence. Every vibe gets different if you are crouched (stealth) or if it's during night time.

I remember going through some ruins, there was a message on the ground saying ""bug"", and a damn lion-cat like twin bladed animal spawned in front of me and killed me. Or the Revenants randomly teleporting nearby you and spitting sounds and poison lmao."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"If you leave the inventory menu open for long enough some dank ass music starts playing. You should check it out

Also one of the dlcs is actually super bright and warm. It's so dope"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"They're wonderful, did the same thing when at Kaer Morhen and various places where the Bear school seemed to be active"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"You don't need much progression really, just make at least 100 arrows, basic leather armor or whatever and then you're golden. Just run from when it charges you or does any telegraphed attacks and you're fine. The 2nd boss is more difficult but you'll be better prepped for it armor wise and gear"
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I have no idea what you are talking about since all of the ""overworld"" in oblivion was generated around you, with no barrier acting as a ""wall"" of what was behind it. So jumping over a wall just meant seeing the city.

Edit: Dont mind me. I am an idiot who mixes up games in their head."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Levitation, for one. Plus, I remember drinking a potion that could max your acrobatics, and with one flick of the joystick you'd fly across the entire map."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Morrowind is just the best.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"One of my favorite builds I played in Skyrim was a non lethal ultra stealth build. It came up by accident. I wanted to be like an ethereal assassin. I used invisibility, ethereal, and the ethereal sword to fight as a pseudo ghost. One of the big build YouTube channels made it. Seemed fun. 

While I was getting to that build. I found an interesting mechanic. Unarmed stealth take downs don’t break invisibility. So I’d use the prayer that allowed me to go invisible, and just not break it the whole dungeon. It was incredible. A group of 3 AI chilling in a small circle shooting the shit, then one suddenly starts choking. The other two panic, but don’t understand what’s happening. The next one starts choking. Finally the last one waits for his turn, but I found the quest item I was looking for off the second guy. So I just walk away, leaving him with his knocked out buddies. 

This was such a fun playthrough. It was literally the ultimate thief playthrough. I pivoted from this assassin idea, to playing the best thief character I have ever built. It was just as easy as stealth archer, but 1000x more fun. 

TLDR: Skyrim can have some great stealthy unarmed builds."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Or just get 100% reflect damage and 100% resist magic and watch everyone kill themselves over you.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-25,…or 5 or 6.
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I got to see them play a double set here right after the release of Surtur Rising. They played the entire new album, took a half hour break, then came out and played a full regular show. In a venue that could hold maybe 300 people. It was one of the wildest shows I've ever been to."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"A few of the tracks in that mix are actually in my playlist as well! ""Helvegen"" is straight up my favorite song from Wardruna."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I definitely agree with the bows, but strongly disagree on the spellcasting. Skyrims spells have more impact and are a lot prettier, but the progression with them is really linear. No spell crafting, no niche utility spells or stat boosting ones, the system itself feels really gutted compared to Oblivion."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"In that case, Oblivion won't do much for you IMO. Oblivions world is pretty one note for the most part, it's only either forests or snowy mountains. Nowhere near as varied and pretty as Skyrim. The looting is about the same, though both games have an okay at best inventory system."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I miss the old rust, it was kinda perfect before they remade it. Now it's just too big and generic."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Opinions are all over the place, but FWIW, I liked Inquisition more than DA2. I feel like Origins has the best overall story and world building, but Inquisition is visually FAR superior and has a lot of QOL improvements. If they every do a full remake of Origins it would easily be my favorite, but damn, it really shows its age, IMO.

Enjoy Inquisition! Buckle down for a long haul - it's kinda grindy."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I'll believe it when I see it!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Jesus Christ be praised!
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I played that game very casually but I found the mace to be the best weapon. Killed everything in like 1 or 2 combos. Sword fights always took way too long
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"This line was the coolest ""I am eject PRAWN suit"""
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Soma is one the greatest, most underrated games I've ever played."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Oh yeah Carian Manor is definitely spooky af. Caelid is also pretty scary, but in more of a post-apocalyptic horror way."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"Blood and Wine! Definitely set the bar for what a DLC should be! It had its dark/creepy parts too, but the setting itself felt so vibrant and welcome."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,I can fully understand how you discovered this.  Trying that tonight
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"If you trained your agility high enough you could jump onto the roofs of buildings and then jump over the walls surrounding the cities. Everything outside the city walls isn't loaded in so you'd see low resolution textures but ground was solid in some places.

Vice versa jumping over the walls from outside. The town wasn't loaded in."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,Don't underestimate the Scroll of Icarian Flight
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"In oblivion you could take out your fists when the game starts and only use them until the game ends while still being an effective fighter though. In Skyrim there are a couple of instances where, with enough preparation, you can kill some things with unarmed damage. It's completely different and it would not have been difficult for them to keep it in for Skyrim."

11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"I mean I guess this is fair. While my unarmed stealth build was incredibly fun. I don’t recall fighting many big creatures with it. I’m more of a, once I beat the game once, every other playthrough is just for roleplay sake. So I probably didn’t progress the story at all. Also random dragon attacks can be annoying. I’ll avoid the dragon fight at the tower like the plague."
11acoxh,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,It was not vanilla. But I think the gist applies to Vanilla. I don’t remember the name of the prayer stone and if it makes you invisible in vanilla or not. But I guess that can be subbed in for any method of invisibility.

What's this? You're a deadric warrior from another realm with ridiculously powerful armor and magic? Sorry I couldn't hear you over the sound of my fist smashing through your face 

Frost troll? You mean frost knuckles and a dead troll, surely. 

I could sneak through this prison, bypass all the guards, and earn the extra reward for this mission, but that guard really looks like he needs a good face punching. 

I'll show you what bear hands can do Mr. bear! 


I just really like to punch things in the face, and I think I might be the only one this upset about not being able to punch everything in the face in Skyrim. It could have been a masterpiece"

It was just sadly serene and oddly uncomfortable. It’s very cool that it began life as a Half-Life 2 mod and I think one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much is that it was a good reminder that we live in a world now where the community can just take these tools and make something totally fucking bonkers with it. "

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I can’t think of too many, but there are very many cool games that have protracted segments with extremely low NPC (friendly or unfriendly) interaction.

- There are a few climbs in Mirror’s Edge for example that I remember with great satisfaction.

- Halo 1/2/3 never had explicitly lonely sections, but the music on the Ark and Halo along with certain Forerunner areas made it super ambient and chilling.

- Minecraft does the same thing really well with ambient music.

- Super Metroid technically often had tiny critter NPC’s. But the whole vibe feels like you and just some Flora/Fauna. Hugely satisfying and atmospheric.

- There’s something to be said about license tests in Gran Turismo games. Just you, the roar of the engine, no music… and the road."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"It doesn’t count, but my favourite game that at least approaches this sort of isolated design is Halo ODST.

There are two sides to the game, the main part is slinking around the freshly abandoned city of New Mombasa immediately after the Master Chief and the UNSC fought their way through it in Halo 2. The only things left alive are you, Covenant patrols, and the indirect messages left by the city’s AI superintendent that communicates solely through traffic signs and safety recordings.

The second part of the game are flashback missions where you romp around as your squadmates in more traditional Halo levels, but exploring the city as the Rookie is where ODST truly shines. The rain, the gloomy neon lights, the smooth jazz, ODST feels very inspired by Blade Runner.

If you’ve never played ODST, you owe it to yourself to boot up the game with a solid headset and play it at night when you’re completely alone."

But I’m at almost 1000 hours in Satisfactory, and there’s gonna be another few hundred, at least, added to that count when it comes out of EA later this year. 

It has great atmosphere and graphics, enjoyable exploration aspects, horrific creatures that STILL make me jump out of my bloody skin. 

But most of all, it has the best creative building system I’ve seen in a game. Conan Exiles, Valheim, and many other games like that, allow you to make fantastic houses and castles. But the factories and rail systems I’ve built in Satisfactory, are the most elaborate creations I’ve ever made in my life. And they are HUGE!!! The logistic planning that goes into it, efficiency calculations, and forward planning, make it a true labour of love. I dam, I do Love it. 

I do admit, it has the option for Co-op, but it’s still perfectly playable as a solo venture, so I think it counts."

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Did they ever finish the story? I bought back when it was just act one and before they made changes to it. I came back a few years later and it was a bit different and they added the second act.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Bets game ever, played since launch.
People here need to realize that the story mode was the extra content that came later, and that the game is all about Survival mode."

Granted, I didn't bother much with the storyline (though it was worth it for that First Aid Kit intro to chapter 2(?)), but survival is meditative, often terrifying, often exhilarating brilliance. One of my favourite games of all time. 

My only criticism is the ton of bugs that come with each update."

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I love these games. There are quite a few interactions with npcs throughout even the first game but especially in riven and exile. The worlds in myst definitely feel empty though and I love getting story through journals.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I would imagine that the videos in Obduction violate the premise. You are very actively talking and watching things ostensibly happen because of them. They just don’t have any 3D models.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I recently played Myst in VR. It brought all the memories I had of playing with my dad back when Myst first came out rushing back to my mind in the best possible way. To actually exist in those spaces, to pick things up and manipulate switches and push buttons, to sit by the grave on the island while flipping through a book, it felt amazing. Most of Myst is perfect, and will always remain so. Still hate the Selenitic Age tho."

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I really, *really* enjoy The End, aesthetically. It's just... so vast, empty, and you feel *so* alone. It's so dangerous, alien, and isolating. It really does give the feeling of an environment that isn't overtly hostile, but just... doesn't care if you live or die. Doesn't even acknowledge you. It's just a quiet little broken place with nothing going on, and any exploration is your choice. You're taking on that danger.

I'm not really describing the enormity of how The End feels to me, but that's kind of it. Idk. It's just phenomenal. Feels like Hueco Mundo, from Bleach, a little."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I loved the solitude of it. I've never been much for online multiplayer, and when I join a server everyone is always playing way more than me, doing crazy stuff, and I feel left behind and confused.

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"The enemies count as npc's, no?

Actually, i guess not, unless you're being incredibly strict about the non player character for. Don't mind me."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I sort of always felt like it was me and Selene. Never felt alone in that game but now that you mention it I suppose I was.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"True, it can be an all alone experience...

But doing my first co-op through Journey, while not knowing it was co-op (I thought the other character was an NPC just following/guiding me) was absolutely mind-blowing! 

After I realized the other player was an actual human-being and looking back at all the things we did together without a word of communication... i got kinda emotional. Something about that Journey that no gaming experience will every be able to replicate and it's left an indescrible bond with some person across the world I'll never meet again.

10/10, one of my top 5 gaming experiences."

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,love The Witness. Really makes you think outside the box like with the Portal games.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I still get traumatic flash backs to all the attempts I had doing the music box challenge... What a wonderful game. I would love to play it again without any of the knowledge from having already done every puzzle. Going in and understanding mechanics for the harder puzzles ruins the flow
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I spent so long staring at the puzzles that look like solar panels in the desert area trying to figure out the rules of the puzzle. I complained about it, and it was the simplest solution to pretty much every puzzle except the, 'Make this bar as tall as the stuff behind it' one."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Once they got past the “how can you have boobies AND a gun” reveal in the first one they had to actually flesh it out a little for the next one and my GOD I’m so glad they did, was Super Metroid the tits or what"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,They are plenty of characters in soma but I hear what you are saying.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,They have a vr mod that really takes immersion to the next level
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,What do you mean there are like 3 npc in that game.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"That game was a lot of fun.  It didn’t quite stick the ending, but then maybe I was just hoping for something more grand?"

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Can confirm.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Wish it was on console. I just can't sit at a desk and play. Hurts my back
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,dont zombie enemies count as an npc tho? not sure what OP is really after. Maybe something like myst where you just explore and solve puzzles
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Don't you get NPC helpers? Would that count as being alone?
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"This is especially true if you played the game completely blind without knowing about glados or any of the plot twists, nowadays that’s almost impossible but going into the game with zero knowledge and slowly unraveling the layers to aperture was one of the most haunting experiences I’ve had in a game."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Lots of witty dialogue for an 'alone' game.

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Back in my day you had to click the tree on every attempt to get wood. Sometimes you ""slipped and failed to hit the tree,"" and you had to click on it again. It definitely wasn't a second screen game back then. 

...I feel like my grandpa talking about walking to school in the snow, uphill in both directions."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,That's the one that connects in with What Remains of Edith Finch isn't it?

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Came here to say this! Such a stylish moody game
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I see what you did there
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Always alone for days at a time...until your screen suddenly goes black and you never even saw where the shot came from.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Nun Massacre is so fucked, first time I entered the school I froze up and my hands were dripping sweat. Very effective atmosphere for a low budget indie"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Are you forgetting the butler?
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,(if you don't count the traders ofc)
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"No, it doesn’t"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yeah, I think you only see those girls from far and about the helicopter guy you don’t even talk to him, right?"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,SOMA has a lot of NPC. You have one in your pocket the whole game.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"**Welcome aboard, Captain.**"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-15,I will 100% never forget building [my first cyclops](https://youtu.be/-ThmKdswcV8?si=VXAUMB4DI5t7sYgS)
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,More like the first time you saddle up in the prawn suit with a drill and grapple
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I hope they totally rework how they approach the story after Bellow Zero. They really killed all the mystery of that world and the aliens for me.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Maybe if you still play it solo. But from what I’ve read they’re adding in co-op, and for me that takes away 90% of the tension and terror that really makes the first game special."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,You mean subnautica 3 right?
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Me2. I hope its thrilling and explorative and has a lot of WTF Moments
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Considering it’s rumored to be a co-op “game as a service” game, i highly doubt it…"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I think a prequel would allow a lot of opportunities for creativity.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,unlikely. its an always online live service game.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"A word of warning, no game gave me worse vr motion sickness than Subnautica. The unanchored 360 degree movement really fucks with your equilibrium."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"One of my favorite games of all time. Also the scariest I’ve ever played, hands down. God help you if you’re playing in VR."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I guess, but that's only at the very end."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I could see the argument.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yes and no. It's a survival game, but you may turn off survival elements if you wish and you do get more and more ""powerful"". It can be beautiful and therapeutic at times, but terrifying at others. It is genuinely a great game, either way"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"For the most part yes, but the ocean is deep and dark and let's just say you're not at the top of the food chain. It can be very scary at times (depends on what you're scared of), but what I will say is I tend not to play scary games but Subnautica is one of my favourite games I've ever played."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"It will scare you a little bit until you learn how everything works and then it's an amazing chill game... 
Unless you have a fear of oceans, then it will scare you a lot and never be chill."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,It's extremely chill and relaxing. And then very suddenly it isn't.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I'm in the same boat. Hate the sandbox survival games. And I think the difference is Subnautica has actual goals other than ""make base bigger/more complicated"". Everything you collect and build is geared toward the goal of finding the answers to a mystery and ultimately escaping. There's a concrete end goal and obvious steps you need to accomplish to get there. Changes the dynamic completely."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I too love Snow runner but I enjoy it more causally. I don't think I could do no teleports, that would be challenging."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Prime 1 definitely fits tho.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I tried the story mode and didn't enjoy it at all. Switched to survival mode and had a blast. Wandering around freely without any real objective other than staying alive made for a very fun experience.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Imagine the pissiness for those of us that started playing at release on steam. I only just got back into it after many years
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Man you're telling me. I got into it when it was in beta. That was what, 6 years ago? And they still haven't finished the main questline?"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Oh yeah episodes have been coming out since it came out of early access in 2017 I think it was.

Not many people play for the story mode though, most of us play survival. The story mode has a sort of mixed reception in the community."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"They are still working on it, the final episodes the next one coming."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,No and I'm worried that they might not.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Late 2024 I think.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Reminder that the rock only stuns the bunny - it's you picking it up, hearing it's little ""peep"" noise and selecting ""kill"" to snap the neck that does the job"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I'll admit that was the worst part of the game for me. Since there are other sources of meat, I try to kill only as many rabbits as are needed for crafting items."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"> I wish they'd get Riven working on PC, with HD graphics, it would be beautiful

[Have I got some news for you.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/)"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"In theory it's happening, there was a fan project 'The Starry Expanse"" and their work has been adopted, along with some of their team, into an official Cyan remake.


I haven't seen news on it in a while, though."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I liked it for the exploration (some truly incredible environments this time) and it had some good puzzles. There’s pretty much no reading in it, which will probably not sit well with Myst fans. I think I liked it more than Obduction but I’m in the minority."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I loved Obduction.

I enjoyed Firmament but found it less satisfying than Obduction, so it might not be for you. You don't directly interact with anything in the environment like you do in most Cyan games. Instead, you use these gauntlets that fit into sockets. It made it more clear what you could interact with, but I found it to be an odd mechanic."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Was gonna mention SotC but I was torn if Agro counted as an NPC.

Is Epona an NPC? Where is the line between mount/companion"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I think I was playing on Creative mode or whatever it's called (where there are no NPCs at all).
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-16,"There were no villagers when I played/in the mode I played. So I'm very much referring to a particular snapshot in time, particular mode, etc..."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Last co-op run that my buddy and I started had water and power set to shut off at the default time. Game starts, and there's already *no water* on day 1. But the power stayed on for the whole two months we survived. Only died because we decided it was bath day down by the river. Saw a lone Zed that must've wandered across the bridge, since we'd spent an in-game week systematically clearing our half of the island.

We shot that Zed. Then, three more came out of the woods behind him. Then we saw ten coming down across the bridge. Then we saw *hundreds* coming from the other side of the island we hadn't cleared out yet. All because we shot a few 9mm."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Sounds like me and my friend XD

The both of us just went straight into ""oh fuck me sideways"" mode"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"yeeeah, I mean maybe they will... but NPC's have been on the todo list since 2013."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,With their development timeline that can be anywhere from in the next year to the next five.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Let me specify:

No living humans"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,If enemy ai count than literally NO game applies to this
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I met the best friend I ever had in Journey. One of the people I've cared the most about in all my life. For a few hours, I loved that person like a brother. Never saw them or talked to them again after we finished the game. Journey is perfect in every way as far as I'm concerned."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Oh, I've always wanted to say this: um, actually, Super Metroid is the third game. The second game is called Samus Returns and was released on the Game Boy. 

In all seriousness, though, they knocked it out of the park with Super Metroid. It was, indeed, the tits."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,The fact the ending gives you an existential dread by being alone in the bottom of the abyss is truly terrifying.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,True but you still feel very alone in there.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Four, I think. 

Two girls, radio lady, creepy man."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I loved the ending. Such a gut punch.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"That’s the point. You were supposed to feel what he felt.

Can’t run from your problems. Have to face them."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Factorio would like a hand raised.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,If we don’t consider ADA an NPC. That’s the hard part because are Minecraft villagers NPCs? Or are they a just mechanic of the game? Cause if it’s the later I’d include a ton of factory builder and City builder games.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Ive actually never gone to an npc village, the game can be played without interactions"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"A lot of folks try to disparage it by calling it a “walking simulator”, but it was one of the most visually stunning experiences I have had in a game."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yeah, but at that point can't it be argued it's just Stanley's internal monologue?"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"yea i guess it adds a lot to the atmosphere playing Valheim alone but isn't there a merchant also? maybe they could add more NPCs in the future, kinda like Terraria and you can build houses for them."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Nah, NPC are not in the game yet. There are some mods that add them but they're super janky."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,There’s like a raccoon thing that speaks to you and that’s about it.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Only with mods
But the devs may also add survivors in the future"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Glados is a robot and the only talking thing besides chatty chell. So technically Your still alone with no humans left because they got killed
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Yeah it is!
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-22,"I actually haven't played Edith Finch yet, but from what I've heard, there's just a little nod to the main character of Unfinished Swan in it, and the theme song of Unfinished Swan is used as the theme of one of the Edith Finch characters."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"that game is so fucking stressful, the atmosphere is great and i love games with stalker ai"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Correct. The helicopter guy only helps you board the copter.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Sorry boss i just wanna say my one of my favourite games 😔
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,**All systems online.**
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"As much as everyone else seemed to love it, I never liked the prawn suit. Give me the fast and maneuverable sea moth any day. I did almost the whole game with just the sea moth, while my prawn suit and cyclops just sat at the base."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yeah, by making Below Zero story more cinematic they ruined a lot of atmosphere in the game."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I just pretend that Below Zero doesn't exist.  Subnautica will always be there and that crappy sequel won't ruin it for me.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"The game will still be a solo experience, just with multiplayer as an option for those who want it"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I was worried about this too, but I believe the devs said the game will be meant to be played solo and co op will be a side thing"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Piloting the cyclops co op with a buddy is literally my dream game.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Sadly the devs very specifically don’t want it to be a horror or tense game. Which is a shame because I think it’s one of its greatest strengths
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,from what i heard is that they didn’t intentionally wanted to make this scary it just so happens everyone has a fear of bigcunts in water
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"If they add co-op and you don’t want to play co-op, then don’t choose to play that way. It changes nothing for anyone, except people who are happy w having the option to play w people. 

Maybe if you werent an insufferable crybaby, you’d have people to play games with"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,You’d think but that’s not what they’re calling it atm
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Below Zero wasn't intended as a true sequel, which is why it sits in an awkward space where it's more than an expansion but not quite big enough to be a proper sequel. Which is why people regard the next game as Subnautica 2 as it looks like its going to be a similar size game to the OG game."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Next title is Subnautica: Serviced Alive
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Oh yeah - but I've done Outer Wilds in VR, so I'm pretty comfortable with 3D movement at this point, I think."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Ahh okay, I might give it a bash ☺️
Thank you for replying!"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-15,"I didn’t really find it to be all that terrifying. I made sure to stay the hell away from the edges of the map where it drops into the abyss, and I saved often. I actually really enjoyed the atmosphere combined with the music."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Okay, thank you ☺️
I'm okay with scary stuff, just have high anxiety, wasn't sure if this game would be a problem or not."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Subnautica has a similar vibe to The Long Dark for me, in terms of scare factor. Neither are scary like jump scares, but they definitely psychologically creepy!"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,i really liked story mode it is hard and merely surviving felt like an accomplishment.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,for real that would suck. would be cool to have warnings on crap like that.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Tbf they completely scrapped and redid the first 2 episodes from the ground up which took them like 1-2 years.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,why is that? been a long while since i played it 
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,it’s been a while but i had the most trouble just throwing it/aiming. the mouse acceleration was so bad it made it very difficult.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Weren't villagers added later? I swear I would only see animals and enemy mobs on YouTube videos.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"They are in creative, just a later addition villages feel more alive now than before they were added."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"> We shot that Zed

Oops. A single zed gets pushed down and stomped out, *every* time lmao. Gunshots are *so* loud in that game, and you are generally fucked if you fire one without clearing a HUGE radius."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Yes there is
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"The best part is, it was probably a few different people!"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Deservedly half of ""Metroidvania"" :)."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,That ending was so fkn good
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I need to replay it, I played it at launch and haven’t since then."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,**The factory must grow**
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Valid point. I think it can.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,But it functions as an NPC with scripting that you interact with
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Ok now I know nothing about this game but I’m instantly more interested.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-15,"You are the best captain on the planet, I’m not even squidding"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"It's not just that, they could've taken the same approach without telling you so much directly. I mean, they literally put one of the aliens in your brain so they can explain a ton about everything going on."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,L take
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Problem is usually companies are too lazy to balance the game for both.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Can you imagine the horror of being completely alone, traversing an alien planet , then just seeing some random guy called TurkeyFucker_22 teabagging a Cuddlefish"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,They did.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Why are you throwing insults? I’m also not complaining…? It’s wonderful they’re adding co-op for the people that want it, I was just mentioning how for me when I play scary games the tension drops off greatly when there’s other people around."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"""they"" in this instance are reporters. The devs have just called it ""the next Subnautica"". In the Subnautica sub right now, there are a handful of people that are very adamant that their chosen number is the only correct choice and will make sure you know it using all caps, poor grammar and multiple exclamation points."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Oh man that's kinda hard to say. Several large areas of the game are clearly designed specifically to induce anxiety.


-Murky areas of low visibility that are particularly dangerous.
-huge play area with many biomes and  no map at all
-creature AI that has no problem following you into ""safe"" areas and just deciding to live there now.
-limited oxygen with sometimes mazelike cave exploration elements and things you can get tangled up in
-heading to a beacon through a new area and there's nothing around you but black in every direction and then you hear something roar.
-of course the computers helpful dialog like ""WARNING: multiple leviathan class life forms detected in this area, are you sure whatever you're doing is worth it?""


There's plenty more. I also have anxiety but this game is a favorite of mine. Just have to play it and see if it's for you."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"It's a similar feeling in survival mode but I think there's more freedom. It can be a real challenge starting in different zones that have less resources, etc.

Maybe I'll give story mode another shot."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Games far too easy, there is no pressure and endless resources. They dumbed down the difficulty for console release awhile back and made the game basically a kids game now, serious players need not apply."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,I got too emotionally invested too quickly lol
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yeah, but of the 6+ years? If they need help envisioning the future of the story I'll help pro bono. I've been waiting since I was nearly a child. I'm almost 30 now, lmao."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Ah. If ever you get back to it, note that if your target is between your index and thumb, it should hit. 

I play on PC but with a controller. Maybe go for that? Or adjust your sensitivity setting. I don't know why I'm piling on advice you didn't ask for; sorry lol"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yup, didn‘t exist before 2013."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-16,Yeah that's my point - I was playing long before they were added.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-15,"That's just the saddest part; we're usually smarter and know better than to shoot unnecessarily! We'd just gotten very comfy and complacent, lmao. Said to one another, ""Why not? What's the harm? There's no others around here; we already killed them.""

It was just a string of poor choices and a bit of bad luck."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Examples?
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I wouldn't be surprised. Man, I need to get back into Journey and try for the white robe."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"lol, they're referring to the dev mascot that gives directions in the tutorial."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,[removed]
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. It’s very rare in my experience to find a game that supports co op and has a fantastic single player experience
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,And thank god for that
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Reporters and the publisher. But then the publisher described it as a GaaS, which the devs denied, so who knows?"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I think the only reason it could be called 2 is if it was very similar to the first one and very different from BZ. Perhaps to show that even the devs think that BZ was bad and that they are trying to go back.

But I think it wasn't bad, just... mediocre. And I think the next game should be called 3, or at the very least not have a number at all. Not that anyone cares what I think."

Like 3500 killed, all of the city systematically emptied of the non-perishables and gas tanks, and it was just two little walkers that caught me off guard.

I enjoyed it because there wasn't anything pushing me through the game. I could relax and figure everything out in my own time, and move on to harder areas when I felt ready. It was still challenging. Items were random, so  you didn't always find the same things in the same places, or not at all. You can start with better or worse clothing, etc, depending on difficulty settings. Lots of fun."

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"The first Halo games are an interesting example, because I played the absolute fuck out of Halo one. Perfect age was like 12 when it came out.

BUT even though I absolutely loved it on BOTH single player and co-op, the Legendary difficulty really felt very unbalanced between co-op and single player. On co op on very hard areas we'd have someone stand in safety, the other guy run out and do what damage he could do before he died, then respawn and take turns. It didn't feel like the hardest difficulty was really 'fair' for singleplayer, since you could get fucking obliterated by a cannon shell from offscreen without any warning and be forced into a lengthy restart.

Still \*incredible\* game and I loved it, but I do think that sort of balance issue on hard difficulties is indicative of making something that works for both co op and single player"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"I've not played it, so very happy to defer to your judgement that it nails it!

I'd just say that \*in general\* I think it's very hard to find a good horror game that also works with co-op / multiplayer, since a big part of the essence of horror games is that being lost and alone feeling

Would be interested to know how Dying Light solves that in your mind?"
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,yeah i can see the appeal now. sounds weird cuz you could die. but i do remember the game feeling really cozy at times being out in the cold then coming into shelter lighting a fire and cookig some tea or food. watching the warmth meter move etc. a game where there is no goal but you can just chill and play can be amazing.
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-15,"Eh? Sorry, you've lost me. I'm still playing an interloper game from before the DLC dropped and beyond the new stuff there doesn't seem to be anything to make the game any easier."

1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-14,"Yep, definitely has moments that feel cozy. Sitting inside by a lit stove, listening to a storm rattle the windows as I waited for a can of snow to melt and boil, for example. The nights with the Aurora Borealis are especially lovely.

It is probably my favorite survival game."
1aq96nv,2024-02-14,2024-02-15,None of the dlc content is available for difficulties beyond voyager. You can play interloper but you are just in the sand box with zero new items etc. just so you know you will never completed anything.

Described as ""comfort horror,"" you can just chill fishing or play dangerously. If you go for the main story quests (pink) you can finish it pretty quick. Even if you decide to 100% the side quests it's not very long. Interesting story. Held my interest long enough that I completed the side quests and encyclopedia without it feeling like a chore."

Each of the recent games (except maybe Resident Evil 4 Remake which is a bit longer - maybe around 12hrs) can be beaten in around 5-10hrs on your first playthrough, and if you ever fancy a replay they can be comfortably speedran in 2-5hrs once you know where to go and have some upgraded weapons.

You've also got Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol 1 releasing next month, if you've never played through MGS 1-3 before, each game ranges from about 6-9hrs for a first playthrough, but be warned they're very cutscene heavy."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I have a similar issue and often want something short that won't take up too much of my time.

Short puzzle and/or action games I've enjoyed (that aren't Portal):

* Gorogoa (gorgeous visual puzzles with a Middle Eastern vibe)
* There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension (inventive puzzles and quirky humor)
* Pony Island (puzzle/action game that screws with your head)
* The Hex (made by same guys who made Pony Island; similar vein)
* The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Edition (exploration puzzler with a lot of humor)
* Antichamber (similar to Stanley Parable but more bare-bones without narration)
* The Room 1-4 (2 and 3 were probably the best but they're all at least decent)

There's any number of great rogue-lites with fairly fast playthroughs but lots of replayability:

* Slay The Spire (classic card builder)
* Shogun Showdown (Japan-themed turn-based battler)
* Shotgun King (chess + shotguns)
* Dicey Dungeons (lots of dice rolling)

I've enjoyed some casual RPGs that were fairly short:

* Breath of Death VII (classic console-style RPG with great humor)
* Cat Quest 2 (cartoony violence with cats and dogs)
* Costume Quest (Trick-Or-Treating the RPG)
* Evoland (more enjoyable if you've played a lot of RPGs over the years)
* Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Heart of the Forest (more of an interactive story than a RPG but I enjoyed it)

Other random short games I've enjoyed:

* Carrion (reverse-horror platformer)
* FAITH (imagine an Atari 2600 game based on the movie *The Exorcist*)
* World of Horror (horror game inspired by Junji Ito)
* The Coloring Game (not even really a game; it's basically digital Paint By Numbers, but it's great when you're fried and need help relaxing)"

One of the most unique gaming experiences I’ve ever had, super engaging the whole way through, total freedom to what route you want to take through the story, and it generally takes no more than 10 or so hours to beat. 

Just some extremely important advice if you’re gonna play it, don’t look into it at all. Like at all. The entire experience of the game is discovering and learning stuff about where you are, what happened, and what’s going to happen. Any information you learn about the game beyond its core premise will reduce the quality of your experience. So it is one of the most “go in blind, you can only experience it once” games you’ll ever find."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I think you should look into the ""rouge lite"" genre.  I play Spelunky 2 and the thing I like about it is that a run can be completed in about an hour.  It's going to take you forever to beat the game but it's great for a run or 2 after work."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,Depending on how much you explore most the resident evil games are fairly short resident evil 8 has an achievement to beat it in 3 hours
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,Tiny Folks is a game you can beat in about 4-5 hours but is a ton of fun.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,I’ll always recommend Crossing Souls
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Remnant 2 came out recently, and the campaign is very short. It's roguelite-ish, you can easily run through the main campaign in an hour or so if you're hauling ass, and your pool of dungeons is randomized, and so is the order you go through the zones. Short campaign with a fair amount of replayability"

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,Gorogoa and Return of the Obra Dinn are two that immediately came to mind for me

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30, Limbo and inside
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Cocoon just came out, I finished it with all the achievements in about 5 hours.  The game is overall excellent if you like head-scratching zelda style puzzles. It’s on gamepass too if you have that.

My only complaint is that thematically it continues the trend of indie low-key creepy theme with a side of I’m-14-and-this-is-deep"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Take a peak at the rogue-like/light genres.  Hades would be a good place to start. Rogue likes revolve around trying to beat a short, randomized, challenging campaign without dying."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"I can recommend Northern Journey if you want an antmospheric game with slight horror elements. 
It should not take long to be finished, and can be played in several parts."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Try “Planet of Lana”.

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Goose game
It’s a super fun game where you run around as goose and do things to irritate the villagers. It also has a great soundtrack that changes based on what your having the goose do."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Resident Evil 7. Also the perfect place to start if you haven't played an RE in a while.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Not much in terms of story but I really enjoyed Rogue Legacy, having never played any sort of rogue like before. Hard at first but you get stronger pretty quick. Easy to put down as well, allowing for short sessions of it. There is a second one I haven’t gotten to yet but it looks decent."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Limbo for a short, intense, unforgettable experience.

A Short Hike for a much calmer but equally unforgettable experience. It definitely lives up to its name—i knocked it out in about two hours—but what a wonderful little game it is. It’s my go-to mental health game."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I mean you could play longer games but in shorter sessions just because a game is long doesn’t mean you have to immediately complete it. Hell I’ve been playing BG3 2-3 hours a day and have been enjoying myself immensely..granted staying spoilerfree gets difficult after a certain while for sure but if there is a game that interests you but turns out to be 100 hours long shouldn’t really be a reason not to play it imo just enjoy it in small bursts
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Most xbox360/ps3 era shooters and action adventure games are 20 hrs

Believe it or not, I used to have a friend, who beat the original Metal Gear Solid for PS1 in 58 minutes. He skipped EVERY dialogue and cut scene. Tapped it off to for me to watch."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Return of the Obra Dinn. It's a puzzle game where you have a pocket watch that can take you back in time to the moment of someone's death. One day, a ship called the Obra Dinn set sail and never returned... until today. Your job is to go aboard and figure out what happened. It's not enough to just see how they died. You need to find out who each person is, what killed them, and who their killer is, if applicable. Not every body is still on the ship, and not every story will be told in the order that it actually happened. You need to use every clue at your disposal to solve the mystery.

It's my favorite puzzle game ever, I wish there were more like it. If I had to guess, it was maybe a 3 or 4 hour game? I don't know for sure, but it's definitely less than 10.

Btw, if you're the type to go for every achievement in a game, I'd recommend looking up the hidden achievements before playing. One of them is kinda... well, dumb. If you don't do it the first time, you'll need to play through the whole game again to get it, and at that point it just feels tedious. But the game itself is still super fun.

Edit: It's made by the same guy who made ""Papers, Please,"" another great game that's probably under 10 hours if I had to guess."

Doom 2016 and Eternal
Wolfenstein New order, Old Blood and New Collosus
Halo CE for sure, but probably most Halo's are beatable under 10 hours
Serious sam (bit unsure on this one but i feel its doable) 
Dead island 1, Riptide and 2 are shorter games if you stick to the main quest.

The goto answer, of course, is a boy and his robot calculator... Oh wait.. It's called Titanfall 2 now. 😁 And he's done the math. 

For a quick fun ride, try Bright Memory Infinite. It's about 2 hours long. It's pretty fun for what it is"

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Honestly, roguelikes for the most part might be up your alley. Procedurally generated games in essence. Typically roguelike runs tend to least up to a couple hours before you either win or lose, then you potentially gain progression to have better cards our a new ship next run. The short run times are perfect because you can pick back up after a long break and not have to remember where you were

**FTL: Faster Than Light** is phenomenal. The gameplay is 2d top down space combat. You select areas on your opponent's ship to target with your weapons and you manage the crew inside your ship to tell them what stations to man for certain bonuses, what to repair, what enemy boarding crew needs killing, what fires to put out, etc. 

**Peglin** is a fun little game that is basically Peggle roguelike, fighting enemies by hitting pegs on the board to deal damage, getting better orbs and upgrades, it's fun if that's up your alley. 

Not a roguelike, but fits the vein of ""I just want to play when I can and not have to remember much about it"" - **Deep Rock Galactic**. Great game about space dwarves getting sent into a hostile alien planet to extract resources while the buggy denizens try to forcibly evict you. Sometimes with explosive bugs, those are fun. But you have guns and explosives of your own to fight back. Each of the 4 classes has a suite of guns and tools used to make navigating the caves easier. Not going to last them all here, there's a lot, but the game is VERY fun and is one of my favorites (rock and stone). The missions are nice and short, lasting anywhere from 10 minutes if you're lucky to 45 minutes if you're very unlucky. Deep progression, lots to do, hard to get bored of it."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Maneater.  10 hrs to 100%.  Loads of fun
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,*The Magic Circle* but it's a bit overpriced so you should wait for a discount.

Similarly, the Call of Duty Campaigns as well. I’d stick to the most popular “trilogies”. MW1, 2 and 3. (the originals not 2019, although MW2019 is not bad) and World at War, BO1, BO2. Unfortunately it’s way harder to find deals ob these games… I’d wait for Steam summer sales. 

If you like story, i’d say look into specifically story based games. Many of them are short… Telltale games, and Walking Simulators are a good place to start."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Skyrim and fallout is good. The main story is only a couple hours long, but there's enough side quests to keep you entertained even if you don't have time to play a lot. I usually boot up Skyrim, do a few quests, run around tamriel, or try leveling something then go about the rest of my day. 

Also, I suggest getting a miyoo mini plus. It's a handheld emulator that can run up to PS1 and is extremely portable. Pretty good if you don't have lots of gaming time (it also comes with preloaded emulators and roms. Not sure if that's legal, but that's less time setting up and more time playing)"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I'd actually go a different route. After I started working full time I've completely switched to playing roguelikes like spelunky 2 or the binding of isaac. An average run usually takes about 40 minutes to an hour and it's basically never finished because of their replayability so you can go back to it every day.

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I've been limiting my own time with games due to personal reasons. But for me, I've found sandbox or relaxing games like Superflight to be great. There's no fomo, or the worry of forgetting important story sections. I make my own fun and the worlds provide it, coming back to them anytime I want. Other games like Mount and Blade, Factorio and Minecraft also come to mind.

Titanfall 2(best FPS ever made) has the best FPS campaign ever made and it’s not long at all. I beat it in one sitting lol.

You're a reporter who's locked in a large zombie infested mall.
You can slaughter zombies while you uncover the truth about how the zombie outbreak came to be.

The whole game is on a timer, which makes this game so special. F.e. you get the info that there are some survivors in a jewellery shop. Now you have a certain time to go save them, if the timer runs out, well, the survivors didn't make it. But the game still progresses. It's just that you have saved less people or missed out on part of the story. After a defined time, the helicopter comes to get you.
So, no matter what you do, the game lasts about 6 hours.

And it has some rogue like element to it. Because you get stronger and faster etc. and you will keep those stats for the next playthrough. Because you WILL miss some events on your first playthrough. And that makes the game great to replay.

But if you hate planning and escort missions, then this game is not for you"

If you have a friend to play with this game is absolutely great. It's really unique. Starts with you two attempting a prison break, but you're in different areas at different times and can see each others screen. Really fun.

Play online or on couch. Either way it's split screen and you have to physically co-operate. Timing is a fun mechanic. The story is great.

Can be completed in one night and is rather inexpensive. Maybe a 7 hour ish game. A nice Saturday, Sunday afternoon to night game. Friday night?

You definitely need someone with you online or sitting next to you though !! Try it. Great game.

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I recommend Hades. As a roguelike the game takes 1 hour or 100 or anything in between, depending how you look at it.

Each run is under an hour, but it resets and you get stronger after each attempt. There is a story that plays out and develops too as you go, but nothing hard to follow that you can't put it down for a few months. 

I know it stretches the rules a bit, but it's a very good 'pick up and play' game that you can commit as much or as little time as you like."

Great little storytelling games with little to no dialogue. It’s a platformer littered with puzzles and collectables to find. The animation and art style is fabulous and it’s a big reason why I bought the game in the first place.

But, I was able to get through Resident Evil Village and then beat it three more times over the course of a month. The first play through took a while longer (maybe 12 hours) because I was exploring and trying to find all of the collectibles and whatnots, but I was able to get through the game in about 6 hours on subsequent play throughs, collectibles and all, while playing on the highest difficulty setting. So if you don’t care about 100%’ing everything, you could easily get through your first play through in 6 or 7 hours and probably cut subsequent play throughs down to 5 hours or so.

It was the perfect snack sized game for me, and I loved it."

Creeper World is also made by the same developer. It's like a tower defense, but you have to play offensively, building a supply network and pushing back a fluid enemy organism.

Both of these games are easy to learn, and each round doesn't last very long, so it's perfect for someone who has limited gaming time."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Lots of great Indie titles.

One run of Undertale is normally under 10 hours, though you'll probably want to go through at least one more time afterwards.

To The Moon is a wonderfully told story. Very little actual gameplay, but it's a real tear jerker and and music is excellent. About 3-4 hours.

Papers, Please is about 5-6 hours long, and is an absolute blast. Really leverages moral choices in a way that few other games do, and manages to make paperwork fun.

Return of the Obra Dinn is an incredibly unique puzzle game and clocks in at about 8 hours.

Walking simulators like What Remains of Edith Finch (2 hours), Gone Home (2 hours), The Beginner's Guide (2 Hours), The Stanley Parable (2 Hours) and Firewatch (4 hours) are great options with strong stories and quick completion times.

A Hat in Time is a love letter to N64 platformers and clocks in at about 10 hours.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a terrific Metroidvania; one of my favorites. 9 Hours.

Speaking of Metroid, Shadow Complex is far more Metroid than it is Vania, but is still a blast. 5 Hours.

Hotline Miami 1 and 2 (5 hours and 9 hours respectively) are trippy top down shooters where the levels can be completed quickly, but the difficulty, quick resets, and lightning fast twitchy shooting gameplay will have you throwing several corpses per minute at the problem until it's finally beaten.

Speaking of fast games, Neon White might be a hair over 10 hours in length, but it's an absolute blast. While it technically only takes about 11 hours to beat the story, you might find yourself absorbed in getting the best times possible in each level.

Doki Doki Literature Club (4 Hours) is a visual novel that wears the mask of a cutsy anime-style dating sim, but hides something completely different under the hood. Not for everyone, but is an absolute trip to play through. It's also free! (There's a Plus version that costs $15, but that just adds some extras that aren't necessary at all for the main story, which is still free on Steam).

Another visual novel, Henchman's Story, is a hilarious superhero story following a grunt of a D-Tier villain who gets wrapped up in a global conspiracy. Wonderfully voice acted (a Team Four Star alumni, Marc ""GanXingba"" Soskin, is the founding member of the studio that made it, and he lends his voice to the game as well).

Gunpoint (3 Hours) is a really interesting 2D action puzzler with a mechanic of allowing the player to attach various environmental triggers together, such are rewiring a light switch to open a door instead, and runs wild with the concept. Great title.

Katana Zero (5 Hours) is a great story based 2D action platformer. And if you want a bit more stealth in the mix, I recommend Mark of the Ninja (9 Hours).

The Witness is definitely too long, but might I suggest its free parody counterpart, The Looker (2 Hours)? Despite being a legitimately hilarious and subversive parody, it still manages some really great puzzles. And again, totally free.

And of course I have to shout out to the XBLA darlings. Limbo (4 Hours), Braid (5 Hours), and Super Meat Boy (10 Hours). And just throw in Inside (4 Hours) as a supplement to Limbo. All great titles. Oh and just throw Celeste (9 Hours) in there too. Why not?

Whew. I went overboard, but my point is: Go indie. Never look back."

You don't have to100%  play a short campaign/adventure game. I have a busy life as well and spend the little time i have grinding OSRS and completing games like God of War 4 and GoW Ragnarok. You can do the same, don't ask for short games because there really aren't much, just play what you enjoy the most, even if it requires grinding."

Like I having limited time I play a sweaty fps multi player and single player only doom eternal , only just played another game recently and it was just my doom eternal friends inviting me that being Among Us

I can see the idea to of finish a game and move on and if it’s to long it can feel tedious"

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Not new, but golden.  I bought Apotheon for 3 bucks during a summer sale back when Steam sales were still fucking wild.  I almost beat the whole thing in one evening.  The only reason I didn't was because my game crashed near the end which is when I realized it has no auto save and I hadn't save manually in like 5 hours which killed my mood at the time.  Still a great title, and I believe still 3 bucks when on sale."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,My problem as I get older is my patience with getting into the game. A lot of games don't really show their true colors until you've been playing for a few hours. I can't really get into those games. The game needs to grab my attention immediately when starting or I'm just not going to play it.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Stray was good and only about 5 hours

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Stray.   It’s beautiful cyberpunk themed game where you play as a cat in a world ran by robots. There is a mystery element added to the game and it typically takes 4-5 hours to beat it. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Standard edition has 5 episodes which are around 45-60 mins long; if you get the Deluxe edition there'll be another episode released soon.

I've just started Cocoon which is a puzzle game; it's only 4-6 hours long so shouldn't take too long :)"

It's got an incredibly clever main mechanic. And you actually start to feel for the characters. After you learn more of what's going on, you hear things in the background and realize what that means for an individual character. The ending was very satisfying and it's a beautiful story and is really fun.

It took about 8 hours to get all of the achievements."

I played through the first time with internet and found another player.  We beat the game together with only chirping.  Never found out the gamertag of the other person, but we stuck together for the 3 hours it took us.  It was a really neat experience.

A while later I tried again, only no internet.  It was a bit lonely, a different vibe to the game.  Completely astounded me that a game could change by not having another chirping player to horse around and get through the game together."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I came here to say Journey and I’m glad it’s been mentioned already a few times. Beautiful game I’ve put over 70 hours in it, just cause every once in a while I have to go back and do it all over again. Only takes me about an hour or two each time so I’ve played *a lot* of times"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Abzu. Same kind of game but underwater
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"sounds great, will check it!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,That is a really cool game.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Came to say this. And brownie points for an earnable trophy for completing the whole thing in <2hrs
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"i agree, although the full price tag is far too steep for what it is. i just about 100% completed it in 6 hours. that's not worth $30 imo"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"If by puzzle you mean “am I mentally challenged” then yes. Otherwise this is a game for people who think pretending your a cat is fun.

For me this wasn’t event worth being free, waste of time."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Glory to Artzoka
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Obra Dinn by the same creator looks cool too
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"This was gonna be my rec too. Just finished it for a second time, I played strictly the story for the plat and it took me about 6 hours."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I don’t think it’s quite as short as OP requested, took me about 20 hours, but yeah a good suggestion otherwise. Surely can be done in under 10 if you go for the main questline only, but that’s kind of a waste IMO"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,+1 on FTL. Great game for short bursts of gaming
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"While we're on FTL, their other game Into The Breach is absolutely phenomenal. Still wish it would come out on consoles."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Soooo it's a roguelite.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I really gotta go play some FTL again, one of the few roguelikes that I really enjoy."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,But don’t you dare pass on the second.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"R&C rift apart sub 10h?  Alan Wake 1 I could see, that was a fun quick play, but I must be 10h into R&C and I'm maybe 50% through main story.  But I suck at platformers, which it's a lot of."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Second this, the main story will take you about 8 hours (depending on how fast you can get through it), but that’s just the start, or about 40% of the game. 

Then, you have the B sides, C sides, Chapter 8, and Chapter 9 (chapter 9 literally took me almost as long as the whole base game)

Essentially: the game itself is short, but if you end up liking it a lot there is so much more optional content you can do"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,Metal Gear Solid games a few hours gameplay and  10 hrs of cut scenes.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Dead Space is also about 10 hours.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-02,Glad to hear someone mention Pony Island. That was a trip!
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I was really surprised by sable, I tried it on gamepass just because of the visual without knowing anything about it."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Had to scroll way to long to find Outer Wilds !  
  
I'm in the same boat as OP. Was playing Outer Wilds in the late evening after work and it was so calming, wandering into space, exploring,...  single greatest game i've played."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I have about 20 hours in the game according to steam. Howlongtobeat also has it at 16+. 10 hours seems extremely optimistic.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"STANDING HERE

I REALISE"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,The best 10 euro I have spent on a game
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"While i would call hades my favorite game it’s tough to recommend if he only wants a <10 hour game, took me way longer then that to even beat my first run lol"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I recommend all these games as well.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yeah, but none of it will make any sense if you haven't played the rest of the series first. It's literally the last game they ever released, and the last in the timeline. If you want to play DOTO, you HAVE to play Dishonored 1, Knife Of Dunwall, Brigmore Witches, and Dishonored 2 first. Luckily, none of those are very long games either. 12-14 hours or less."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Dread is the perfect length for a Metroid game, these games are meant to be played multiple times trying to go as fast as possible. In fact 7 hours is quite long for dread."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Unless you're speedrunning the game, I'm not sure 10 hours is realistic. I guess if you skipped absolutely everything that isn't main missions, it'll be around 15 hours. But I probably put around 30 hours in before beating it."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I’ve played both Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, HIGHLY recommend both. Walking Dead is self explanatory. If you like noir and fairy tales WAU is an absolute gem. Any of these games are really easy to get into and out of. Great for limited time commitments!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I'd say that Steamworld dig 2, steamworld space and Steamworld Quest also are very approachable games of suitable size."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,That's what's great about Hades. It could be 10 hours or could be 100 hours.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,Im close in 13 hours. The game says I'm 100% but I'm missing 3 achievements (get all other achievements included) because they're just annoying grinds.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Announced? That sequel is imminent my dude, and boy does it look like it's going to rip"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Also split into chapters with a ""last time"" summary, so great if you have to keep picking it up and putting it down."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,That was a very short game. When it ended I wished it could be longer.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"See the problem is when you suddenly don't have time to game for a few weeks and completely forget where you were and what you were doing, happened to me with ff7r, never got back into it."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Speaking for myself, while I do enjoy playing longer games too, short games are nice because it's easier to put them down once they're done and focus on other stuff you need to be doing.  For instance, I LOVED Baldur's Gate 3, but until I beat it, it was always invading my brain when I was trying to focus on work."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yea, when a speedrun takes 32 minutes to complete but also 6 years of practice..."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Dude please don't lie to OP, only if you are a speedrunner of that game you can complete it in less than 10 hours."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"For Halo, I'm pretty sure there's even an achievement for a couple of the games for beating the campaign in under 3 hours. I don't quite remember if there's a difficulty tied to it though."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Great game too.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Sounds good. Happy Cakeday!
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Oh dude I hopped on as soon as I heard. It's better than I remember. 

Get back out there pilot!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I still consider Attrition to be the pinnacle of warfare. It’s just so epic.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I'm so happy, my 8yr old just got into this game and absolutely loves it, it's such a great FPS and he's really taken to all the mechanics."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,On PS4 as well? Love Titanfall but haven't got an active PS Plus subscription.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I was glad to see this. It was always such a hidden gem. I'll start playing it again shortly too, and I hope it perhaps convinces Respawn to consider a Titanfall 3 someday."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,And that’s just on steam. Doesn’t account for EA/Origin
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Damn I might have to get it.  I’ve only heard great things about
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Holy shit, I'm gonna have to dive back in. Loved the multiplayer on this"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Man am I glad I came across this! I recently bought the game when it was on sale because I heard how great the story was, but with the understanding that PVP was a graveyard. I’ll definitely make time for multiplayer later since TF1 was some of my absolute favorite gameplay."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Oh I didn’t! I’ll have to jump on. Screw Apex 😂
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I was not aware. That’s awesome. I loved titán fall so much
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Woah please tell me it's both titanfall 2 and on Xbox. I NEED MY TITANFALL AGAIN!
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-02,Only on Pc or on every plattform?
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Is that on the unofficial servers? 

There was a group who was tired of the hackers and EA not doing anything about it, so they took it into their own hands; literally made their own hands, made an entire client and everything."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Hey, I'm the same type as you, just like you I can't stay interested enough to complete games and I play multiplayer games all the time

But the portal series is damn good, you should give it a try

Can you also give me some single player suggestions?"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I’ve found when you don’t want those ‘quality’ games, straight up fun games are so much better. I got lost in Rune Factory 4 after putting off playing ghost of tsushima and spent like a couple months (prolly like 100 hours) crafting and building up the farm and it was great. I had far too much fun with that game."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,[deleted]
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"Totally if you wanna get like a 100% completion, but it’s not uncommon to run through it in like 7-10 hours. I think I hit about 6 and a half on it. Granted, I just powered through in an afternoon/evening, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to peg it as a sub 10 for most."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Idk what you did, but that is definitely not the usual campaign length."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,i’ve beat it in an afternoon..
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I played the VR version and it's an amazing experience. You're basically there with her, and when see looks you in the eye it gets absurdly real. My top gamepad+VR experience."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"> Hellblade is such an incredible game and it's usually really inexpensive to purchase.

Wow yeah, it's 85% off on GoG right now. I'll take a gamble."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Had it wish listed in PS for ages and no sale
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Yeah - surround sound headphones.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,It’s about to beat ocarina of time seriously it’s that good for me
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"+1 for Into The Breach!  Also don't forget about their other game too, FTL!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I tried this 2 times but at what time does it get fun? Also does the artstyle stay this dark?
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"they straight up warn you at the beginning, do not play this if you have a mental illness. It absolutely could trigger some stuff, I agree"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"It's got a lot more meat to it, yes, but the main campaign takes about eight hours:

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,My wife is super picky with games but loved donut county! Been harassing her to do untitled goose game next
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,+1 I still think about the fish factory after 5 years of playing. What an excellent game.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I full on related to the character in that scene. When it ended I ugly cried. Fucking 10/10 experience.

(BTW I'm in a better place mentally now)"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I expected to love this game but somehow did not manage to get into it at all beyond finding the scenery somewhat interesting.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"You can still find people on it on occasion. There just aren't as many as there used to be (and if they're playing with a white cloak, any new players won't encounter them; you have to beat the game at least once before you can encounter white cloaked players).

Edit: may be worth checking out the Journey subreddit to see if anyone is up for being online when one wants to play, so as to find a friend to journey with."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"My wife is not a gamer but sometimes I just turn on some game and give her controller, Edith Finch was one of those games and it was funny to watch her going wtf throughout whole game 😅"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Well, even if you rush to the end, there's so much to do! Getting all Feathers, doing all side quests, fishing  for every kind of fish. There's more content than you would expect on that island!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"It's the game I go back to whenever I'm having a serious depression spell. It never fails to make me feel better, although it's a little sad to never see any companions anymore."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I don't, I'm afraid! I didn't play the VR one but I guess that technically counts as a 4th installment?

But if you like slightly disturbing puzzle games I do recommend the Cube Escape series (Rusty Lake) which is mostly free, and the associated (cheap) premium games. Those are some of the only other mobile games I've paid for.

Oh, and Monument Valley 1&2. Those are something special!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I have so many of these but haven't had a chance to play them yet 😁 I loved The Last Campfire, though, that one I have played!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Thanks for the recommendation! 😁
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Limbo is good but Inside is better
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,[deleted]
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Oh wow, they have a new game out!? How did I miss this! Thank you!"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I see what you did there
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Same, and I'm fine with that. Especially considering the game isn't expensive."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yeah, same here. I really enjoyed it but replayability isnt its strength"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,You can camp in one for free
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,No offense but you really should have done research its not hard to find out the game is 90% walking and its just as easy to know if thats a good type of game for you
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,As in you're stuck in a level or you enjoy it so much you've been playing it again and again?
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"There is portal stories: Mel. 
Very much recommended, and free if you have portal"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I believe you.

Did you do the co-op with your Japanese girlfriend that goes to another school?"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,yeah if you're looking for value the ratio of how long it takes to play vs how long it sits rent free in your head is pretty good
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,What’s a humble bundle?
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"The game is about how forming random connections is easier than we think, I honestly couldn’t imagine how lonely it’d be without another person :( 

I’ll never forget my first climb of the mountain, Journey is something special."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Second Stray! It’s friggen fantastic!
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I've heard plenty of good things about that game but never played it myself.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,stray was not long enough. game was beautiful
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"My mental illness and I had to nope the fuck out. The auditory noise fucked me,"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Stray's $/hour ratio is way, way better than movies or restaurants or beer."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"You're in a thread where OP is looking for shorter games, what did you expect? They likely have more money than time, where $30 is just not enough money to matter or worry about some hr/$ ratio."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"That equates to 5$/Hr for entertainment.
That's cheap comparatively to most other alternatives outside of gaming

I'm sure most wage earning adults could agree that, at the minimum, a third of what your hourly wage is (assuming 15$/hr) for entertainment sake is completely reasonable. 

You get paid 15 and hour to endure whatever it be (let's be honest, even if you like your job nobody actually WANTS to be at work) yet you'll subject yourself to playing a cat game for the equivilant of 5$ an hour by personal choice.

Even if it's completely un-enjoyable, I've spent much more on useless, non entertaining things."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I like pretending I'm a cat but this game is a snooze fest. So boring. 

It's nice to look at. Novelty of paying a cat wears off really fast when you notice the lore is uninspired and the gameplay a bit above Superman 64."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"It's closer to a roguelike than most other roguelites. Sure, you unlock ships, but each new run your ship starts over at the same basic build without any carryover upgrades. The unlocked ship layouts just off different play styles."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I platinumed it at 14 hours, Main story is probs around 10 hours"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Unless it's MGS4.

Then it's twenty minutes of gameplay and 14 hours of cutscenes."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Metal Gear Rising is not really long as well
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,See also: Final Fantasy
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,YOU WERE JUST LIKE ME
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I agree, its a good recommendation for people who have a small window each day for gaming, but not for people who want to complete a game in a small amount of time."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yeah I never completed Witcher 3 because I got really far in, took a break, and now don't remember any of the quests I was doing so never went back lol"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yup, also makes it worse for me having to try to remember mechanics and controls"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yes, of course. I'm sorry, I guess I didn't give it much thought, but my point is that Hollow Knight is just so good and fun that OP can easily bypass the 10-hour limit. As he has a lot of experience in video games, I think he'll finish the game pretty quickly."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Servers fixed on PS4!
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Or games pass
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"No dude, Respawn fixed the official servers! Lots of players back on, matchmaking working properly, the game is officially back and it feels amazing"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"It seems a lot of us have this very same problem. Coupled with sales and 2 free games a month from Xbox and now PlayStation, and I have such an intimidating backlog. 

However, at my age (40), I'm learning that I'm kind of sick of the sweat in multiplayer games. I'm on a kick to start knocking out some real single player gems. 

Recently I just (finally) beat GOW 2018, and am currently halfway through on both  aliens dark descent (PC) ff7 Remake (PS5), with a small break on Hogwarts Legacy (Xbox). 

I'm picking one game per platform and whatever tv is free (or no tv = PC), I'm working on. Having a blast so far. 

Gow, while awesome, still hasn't topped my recently beat Nier automata... might just be the best story I've ever seen in a game."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I would say 6-8 hours… maaaaaybe 10.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I played it on normal difficulty.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,It got scary fast when she touches your actual face at the one point.

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,the mental illness in question was the reading disability /s
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Hard same. Every time I have a repetitive task to do it makes me think of it.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I am sorry to hear that. What did not click for you? I got immediately sucked in, and, to my very own surprise, it is definitely one of my favorite games of the last generation."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"That’s probably the right play. But man, it was magical just having a stranger pop in out of nowhere, and now you’re just doing this thing together. What a moment in gaming history that was."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I know what you mean. I'll play on a Sunday afternoon to get myself good for the week to come. There definitely aren't many companions anymore, but it's cool when people drop in"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yeah also played both Monument Valley's, might have to check Cube Escape"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,The puzzles in limbo are way better but the atmosphere and visuals in inside is better
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Hades holds that spot for me
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Was released yesterday so 😎
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"The co creators of Playdead split up - one made Somerville, which was not well received (67% on steam), and the other made Cocoon which just came out and is reviewed very well (96% so far)."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,;)
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,How? I live in Australia.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I've played walking simulators that are good. Firewatch isn't good even for a walking simulator.

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-09-30,"I liked the gameplay and the story was good, but I feel the protagonist was pretty dumb for not seeing the ending ahead of time, it was fairly obvious what would be the outcome of your objective by the halfway point"

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,what is the purpose of this comment then? added absolutely nothing to the conversation.

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I'll take a fantastic 6 hour game over a drawn out, grindy sidequest filled borefest like most triple a games. I got more than my money's worth paying Stray"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"It is still more of a roguelite rather than roguelike imo. Considering it's more of a tactical strategy with roguelike elements but not close to original Rogue in terms of design.

&#x200B;

Then again the whole roguelike vs roguelite debate is rather subjective."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Actually I replayed the first 4 recently, and MGS4 was the one which had the most numbers of hours of gameplay in total. It also had the most cutscenes, but I kind of appreciated having longer gameplay sequences.

In terms of cutscene/gameplay ratio, I'd say MGS2 is the worst (at least, on a replay, maybe if you wander around more on the first playthrough it's not as bad, but on a replay I'm usually playing for like 1-2 minutes and here we go with another cutscene in MGS2 \^\^)."

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I played it not too long ago and encountered at least a couple people. Dunno what the experience was way back when but I found it incredibly enjoyable, probably my top 5 games of all time"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Oh really, what about Firewatch didn’t you like? I really enjoyed it but not clicked other walking simulators."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Oh yeah, figuring out the last part of the puzzle was a pain in my first playthrough, but after actually completing the story once, I spent so long on levels in that playthrough that all the puzzles are sort of muscle memory to me and every new playthrough now is just a speedrun for the fun story ever since."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Yeah takes a certain mindset. When you're so invested in the puzzle, you can think 'OK I have everything except this one part' and figuring out the last bit is so high stakes and thrilling, or alternatively frustrating.

For me I plow on and if I get frustrated enough I google it. If I feel like I should have got it, I carry on. If I feel like there's no way I could have known that, I rage quit."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,I’d like to think it was wishful thinking and an inability to accept the reality that they were in
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,They heard good stuff. They pointed out it has positive feedback. Why are you upset with them being pleasant and sharing the information?
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"lol, makes no sense that people are downvoting you instead of the other comment when the true purpose of the downvote is to essentially tag comments that are off-topic and add nothing to the conversation"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,What was the purpose of your comment? To attack someone else? You talk about adding nothing and yet you do it yourself. Human intelligence at its finest guys!!!
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Pretty sure they're talking about the robotic noises, extremely grating."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,No but being an asshole is
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I'd say each of the Metal Gear Solid games (or at least the first four) probably have a similar ratio of 60% cutscene, 40% gameplay.

MGS2 possibly dips into 70/30 though, the Big Shell map is so small and the game so linear that it's basically impossible to go five minutes without triggering the next cutscene."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,BUT WHO’S TO JUDGE

16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Why would you feel sorry for someone who enjoyed the game longer than you?
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Honestly, you only need to run into one or two people to have a blast. It’s a short game, so back then once someone joined, they were probably going to finish it with you.   
  
Being alone in this expansive desert, just seeing this mountain and trying to get there… finding secrets but not being sure how to get to them… and then someone shows up. You can’t talk with them so they make a little short beep. You don’t know what it means. Now you make a short beep. They move towards something off the obvious path and make a longer beep. OOOH, longer beep now means “come here let me show you this.” You get a thing and they do a bunch of short beeps and jump around - excitement! You continue this journey, building a little more communication based on beep length and intensity and body language, and you progress towards this thing, you don’t even know what or why. And then, in the freezing cold, where you would have died alone, you’re not alone. Your friend is right there with you, freezing to death. It’s terrible and beautiful."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Nothing happened. A lot of buildup for nothing.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"I think maybe thats what they were going for, but it felt like he just didnt catch it the first time when it was said to him exactly how shit works"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"“i’ve never tried heroine, but i’ve heard good things!” would you take that person’s opinion into consideration? (not that anyone should ever try it, shit will ruin your life in less than a month)"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"would ride into battle with you any day, too many people are just obsessed with being heard i guess?

it’s pretty pathetic tbh. everyone deals with insecurity, an increasing number are seeking to validate it rather than grow up. idk what can be done to fix this problem in society at this point. reddit is just about equal to facebook now, but definitely a symptom rather than the cause."
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"so you agree you added absolutely nothing to the conversation?

sorry, 20+ comments/hour is surely indicative of a productive life and strong social skills. go back to facebook and buzz feed like a good little single-celled organism. plenty of useful calories are wasted on your brain."

But it’s been about 4 years since apex has been out, there’s no way they’re not working on TF3"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-02,"I played it offline the first time and that is an entirely different experience as well. But it was at a convention so while it was busy and chaos around me, with the headset on and hyper focus it was a calm within the storm, peace in the chaos and a journey to find meaning in it all. Pretty sure that the end was the first time I cried from a video game because that journey resonated with my soul"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"Spoilers for SOMA that might make it a bit clearer why that's not so crazy:

>!They already swapped bodies once and it was fine remember? You left one behind when you got the deep water suit (who you either kill while asleep or leave there to wake up in a similar predicament).  They just assume they're the one who makes it out, but they're not.  The end is the first time the player has to face the reality of being the version left behind, and we see the character doesn't take it very well.!<"
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,Good point but I think the ending was more impactful with how they did it because it was like “Wait… what?” and then you the player are left to make sense of the horror facing the MC forever
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,This seems like a disingenuous comparison.
16wh6md,2023-09-30,2023-10-01,"that literally ahs what to do with someone saying ""i have heard that game is good so i would say it's worth a try""

""necessity of being heard is a false right too many have coerced themselves in to"" and yet here you are doing exactly that.

get back in the straight jacket since you clearly got some screws loose with this rant over someone saying they've heard good things."

q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,"It's really an awesome experience. The only thing I would change about it is to have more parts like the creepy forest in the beginning. Once you get into the more mechanical places, it loses a bit of the scariness and the beauty of the earlier parts.

It does add an intense feeling of emptiness and being alone, though. The only things left are machines and you."
q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,"My favorite part is how hopeless the whole game feels. Every other human you encounter seems terrified of you, and everything else seems like they just want to mindlessly slay things. Playing it for too long makes me want to curl up in a little ball under my blanket. "
q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,"I bought Limbo with no expectations. I had no idea what the game was about, my friend just told me it's a real treat. And, after playing it, it really is a treat! Great game!"
q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,"Yes, yes you do."
q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,"It's not actually that terrifying of a game.  There's a shock factor each time something new pops out of nowhere and kills you, but once you know what to expect there's nothing scary.  Also, the spider only appears a couple of times and only in the beginning."

q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,Right click -> inspect -> right click on the node (in the code) -> delete node
q8uke,2012-02-27,2012-02-28,"In chrome, you can basically just right click and say inspect elements.  You'll get a little window on the bottom that will display the html.  When you mouse over a bit in the little window, it will highlight what that is in the main window.  Then you can just right click -> remove node.

If you need quick and simple, , you can delete everything in the ""center"" portion except the video (you will be left with black bars on the side for widescreens), but the other way (deleting the objects that are unneeded in the ""mycontent"" section) will leave the video fit to screen.  When you're done, just close the little window.  If you screw up or want to see the original, just refresh the page.

There's probably a way easier way, but it only takes me about 30 seconds, so it's not a big deal to do, especially when I leave it up most of the day."

19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-01,Pretty cool but I think the spiders were a bit bigger.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,[I have something similar above a door in my bedroom](http://i.imgur.com/C64V3Iz.jpg)
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-01,So long as the spider doesn't glow.  That shit would not fly in my house ;)

19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-01,nope. never. I would destroy my cabinet at first sight.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"""Ooooh man... last night was crazy. Gonna go get a drin-HOLY SHIT A SPIDER"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,i would really freak out and start hitting the spider 
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"I love this, but I can't have that spider in my kitchen!"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-01,Do you have a link for the stencils?
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-01,That's really neat. I never could understand why people love this game so much though...
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,Nice Haloween decoration. Terrible actual home decor.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,a glow in the dark spider on your wall. I don't understand how this is a good idea.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-01,"But wait, there's more!"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,It's not a spider as it has only got one body segment. It might be an [Opiliones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiliones) that lost two legs.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,One of my first sticker projects was a [Mario themed bathroom](http://i.imgur.com/i8os6Yq.jpg) in an old apt. [Another wall](http://i.imgur.com/Jw3g6mz.jpg). Also did [this one](http://i.imgur.com/vEikdRB.jpg) on the TV wall in the same apt.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"Not sure why this is downvoted. I couldn't remember (and have always been the worst at dimensions) so I [googled it](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS438US438&q=limbo+spider+scene&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bvm=bv.43148975,d.eWU&biw=1366&bih=643&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=jI4xUaPGIoXW9QSg7ICwAg) just to see and it looks like you're right. Thanks for the complement btw."
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,Awesome! That's way bigger than mine. Did you paint them on or make decals? I love the little invaders to the side.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"I'll try to get a good shot tonight when I get home. **Edit:** Yeah, that does not work. Cause dark and black stickers. Sorry, just looks like a dark room with a tiny spot of glow in the middle of the frame. :/"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"Sorry I didn't use any. My best advice is to pick your favorite still shot(s) and just copy 'em. They're fairly simple even for beginners just because of the artistic style of the game.
"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"For me, it was the general atmosphere of the game - dread, despair, and loneliness. It was puzzley, but not to the point of wanting to kill yourself trying to figure them out. The ending really cinched it for me - easily one of my favorite games post-2000."
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"Ha! You would hate every part of my house. There isn't a damn thing in it from Kirklands or wherever it is the vanilla people buy their pleasantries. I do make/have a lot of sculptures of Cthulhu, taxidermy skulls, normal paintings which I've added zombies into. Oh! And for Christmas my fella bought me 2 funhouse mirrors and his mom bought me a sheep brain in a jar. Soooo.... yeah. I'm sure your vases & bookends are equally nice and more suitable to your tastes. ;)"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-03,"thanks for the heads up, still look scary as hell though!"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,The Asteroids one is especially good. Very nice. How long did it take you to plan where things would go/what sizes they would be? 
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"They are actually just printed out and carefully cut out, a very simple ""Hey, I have an idea... I wonder what that would look like"" I would make them better, but being up above the door like that you cant look closely at them.

[Also, here is a better pic of those invaders.](http://i.imgur.com/aiEDKay.jpg) I should fix them up a bit, they have been there for like 2 years so you can really tell they are just paper when you look at the non-black ones"
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"You're right, I'd hate your home, but it is YOUR home.

You'd hate mine, aesthetically everything matches, contemporary, and homie, it looks like  Martha Stewart vomited all over it."
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,I honestly just doodled them out in various sizes and then tried to stick them up on the wall in a pattern that appeared random. Not really a great planner.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,Well they look good either way! I did a wall of an old apartment in [Asteroids](http://i.imgur.com/vEikdRB.jpg) stickers I made a few years back. I really wished I had tried to preserve them during the move because they were too tedious to want to make again.
19h1ew,2013-03-01,2013-03-02,"he called the shit, poop!"
