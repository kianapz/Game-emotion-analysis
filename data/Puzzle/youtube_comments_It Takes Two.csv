Puzzle,It Takes Two,2018-09-21,"comment section 50 say that this is a ripoff of the parent trap. 40 say the parent trap ripped this movie off. 10 argue further. to settle the arguments, the original story is das doppelte lotchenn by erich kaestner, better known in english as lisa and lottie. lisa and lottie was adapted in the '60's as the parent trap. it was later also used as inspiration for the 1995 movie it takes two. then the parent trap was remade in 1998, and borrowed a few ideas from it takes two. neither the parent trap or it takes two are ripoffs of each other. the parent trap is an adaptation of the book, while it takes two is inspired by the same book, but goes in a different direction with it. i like all the versions, the book and all three movie adaptations. they are fun movies. now can we stop arguing?",Before

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-21,"i like them both.....but i have to favor cody. what gives him the edge is how it felt like cody was willing to play along and may felt like she didn't want to, even near the end. i was kind of waiting for her to say something about her passion to sing but it felt like she was always resisting the idea of singing in front of people until the last moment. there was also one moment where cody was saying something about the game they were playing and may said something like cody this isn't real and then moments later they were in a kaleidoscope and she said this is the heart of the kaleidoscope is that even a real thing? i get the feeling she is a professional gaslighter from stuff like that  edit just looked it up to make sure. it was in the kaleidoscope level where may told cody that they are just in a kaleidoscope and that they crate illusions as if what cody and her were experiencing was only because they were in the kaleidoscope and not that there is actual magic manipulating space around them. then when they got to the platforming area she said this is the heart of the kaleidoscope as if a platforming area was expected in there meanwhile cody is having a mental crisis after space warping around him. he even called her out by saying is this still just an illusion before she made the statement that they wer ein the heart of the kaleidoscope, again as if she knew it woudl be there.",After
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2023-01-14,"grid legends vr was clearly corporate robbery, a crash grab anyone can see that, i mean ea literally did zero promotions on the game, didn't even post it on any of their social medias feeds, then requested preorders while releasing no review keys to content creators so that us the consumers wouldn't know what we're paying for before it's too late, no , ea  meta waited purposely so people would buy the game not knowing the terrible state it's in, ea  meta used multiple different shady tactics like placing the game in oculus store spotlight section, asked for preorders, refuse to release early access keys, it's apparent now why there was no promotion leading up to its release, these are corporate tactics that perpetuate the cycle these are corporate crimes ea  meta are clearly working together to rob it's consumers, it's apparent cuz the last game ea released in vr, medal of honor got abandoned immediately after it's release, it is a buggy piece of trash with potential that received no love via updates  since it's released meta is still pushing the game to unexpected victims in the spotlight section, it released november 15th 2021 since then it has not seen one single price drop, still 39.99...i've learned my lesson a long time ago, i will never purchase a game without doing extensive research.. these companies do it because we let them do it to us, if we stop purchasing their games  take a united stand we will stop this vicious cycle. these corporations have became out of control they're not even hiding there greedy corporate tactics anymore....",After
