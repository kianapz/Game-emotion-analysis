Anyone who gamed in the 90s and 2000s before online play will remember console games with family and friends.  This is that, but with good graphics.",63

It looks decently alright with the humans but Sonic Adventure 2 and Sid the Science Kid taught us all LONG ago that applying mocap to a stylized cartoony character design just looks like shit. And it's weird because the in-game animations are these gorgeous, fantastically done hand animation that REALLY fits the character designs, the running and jumping and everything when you're actually playing are amazing. But then you get to the cutscenes and it's the Mascot Suit Problem, ""these characters shouldn't move like this"", it's almost uncanny valley.
But otherwise... yeah this looks super fun to play! I'm glad it's got stuff that makes it accessible to those who aren't HARDCORE MOUNTAIN DEW AND DORITOS APEX LEGENDS TITANFALL FPS XBOX LIVE GAMERSCORE GAMERS, my gf really likes 2D platformers but isn't really as into games as I am, and I've been wanting to try this, so I'm sure it'll make a great Christmas gift for us both.

Kids do not read in to some of the more adult conversations the same way adults do, and enjoy the colorful, puzzle filled world, where 2 toys (who can not die) are solving challenges and trying to get back home to their house, while fighting bugs and other fictional monsters (And also taking photos and playing minny games on the way).

This is the chance your love will show itself!‚Äù Or something like that.

Like you said, you can feel the passion behind the game. Something you didn't mention is ALOT of things are interactive, literally for the sole reason that it's fun. And that's how you know this was a passion project, you can stay away from the path and find some random button you can push or even some random thing you wouldn't think you can interact with, but you can, and it serves no purpose other than it's fun.

Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels
One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar
Like an island, he's all alone
Two can make just any place
Seem just like being at home
It takes two, baby

You know it takes two, ha
One can go out to a movie
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie
Something really kind of neat
And one can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinking that it's really nice
But two lovers walking hand in hand
Is like adding just a pinch of spice
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby

Kane Brown and Khalid, they both can't sing.  We have to get rid of those two streets singers from country music.   Be smart.  Don't ever collaborate with Kane Brown or Khalid, because they are a joke.
You wanna know why nobody wants to collaborate with Kane Brown?  You wanna know why nobody wants to sing with Kane Brown?  Because, Kane Brown can't sing.   Every American saw his BS performance at CMA awards about 5 years ago.   I think he and Khalid sang a song called ""Saturday Night"" together.   Every American hated their disgusting performance.  It doesn't get any worse than that.  It was the worst performance EVER in American music history.  We have to get rid of Kane Brown permanently.  Their voice made me sick...../////",0

The colour combinations and the actual way of their designs are interesting.

May's is much more orderly, thought out, and put together. She was made by a pro. She's a puppet and can be easily maneuvered.

Cody's is very thrown together. He's got leaves everywhere and is overall very messy. He's harder to move around.

May's colours are repeated and synced. The blue in her hair and pants match, with the yellow bowtie in her hair and shirt matching.

Cody's is very messy and mixed.
He's got brown and green and tan. they're much more diverse.

Even the way their pants are repaired. May's is very secure and is neat and tidy. Cody's is barely hanging on with three. They're both somewhat messy, but May's is less messy than Cody's, just to make more evidence to my point.

Overall hat's off to the designers.",6
