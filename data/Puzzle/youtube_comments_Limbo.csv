Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-03,"this is really interesting. i've beaten the game on many separate occasions getting pretty familiar with all the areas and atmosphere, but i had never done the additional dark room until the day i'm writting this. that genuinely creeped me out. almost all of it is pitch black, much of what you hear are loud, harsh noises of metal or bullets firing. every time there is a little bit of comfort in the light, it is abruptly snuffed out and you are suddenly forced to run for your very life. it doesn't add much to the actual story, but i think it, like the rest of the game, also has some very strong symbolism. it feels like a state of emotional panic for the boy, perhaps representing what he felt during his life in the world around him. the saws, the guns, the mechanisms all crashing around, it may be all of the anxiety finally catching up to the boy and crushing him. one section in particular near the end of the dark room has a breif moment of silence in the darkness broken only by the lazy drone of an insect. but just as you start to settle in, it dies to the columns of machine guns firing constantlyon either side of the boy. i really wonder what this signifies, if anything at all. i think it could possibly have something to do with the reminder of how close his freedom from limbo was when he had grabbed onto the insect's leg before, which is actually the same area that you enter the dark room from. again, that little bit of hope, that small chance...destroyed. well in any case, i've written enough. i hope if anyone ends up seeing this that you were entertained by my banter. have a great daynightdawndusk.",After
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-01-19,"a friend of mine had bro night sleepovers around like 2011 or something. we played a lot of halo on xbox 360 and chowed down on snacks and played all night just to sleep in super late. one of us saw limbo in the menu and played the free demo which was great. at a later sleepover i couldn't attend, the guys got the full game and finished it and enjoyed it, though they needed some assistance with walkthroughs or online advice. told me it was a lot of fun. fast forward to 2018 and i got my first smart phone so i got limbo and passed the demo and got the full version for 2.99. passed it in one day on a snowy saturday with a few pointers from walkthroughs. felt guilty for wasting the day but my brotherroommate basically said if you enjoyed it the day wasn't wasted. the nostalgia hit hard while playing and still does seeing videos like this. those bro night guys and i have grown apart but i'll always cherish those days. these days are pretty good too in a different way. always something to be grateful for. it's like that saying, something like one day we'll look back at right now as the good ol days and there's probably several versions of that quote. basically you don't know what you got til it's gone. however that changes if you practice gratitude and enjoy the now while it's here. appreciate the little moments along the way and be thankful for the people in your life right now. i've adopted this attitude and it helps. there are things to enjoy now while they're here and different things to enjoy down the road. these are the good days, and that's always the case in each chapter of life. not sure why i shared all this but it felt good to.",After

Puzzle,Limbo,2022-11-26,"i remember giving you the layout for this level to play as a joke, you weren't even a playtester for the level or anything, but as time passed, your love and dedication towards limbo had managed to surprise me and eventually the verification made it's way in your hands. at first, i was reluctant. i feared that someone who's hardest was a top 2030 now wouldn't be qualify to beat a level like this. a lot of people told me to do so, a lot of others told me to give the level to someone else and finish it quicker, but you managed to stamp your name onto it as yours and only yours to finish. your perseverance proved to be against all odds. this level would have come out quicker if i did give it to someone else that's true, but i'm sure i wouldn't have had much fun watching another guy play it. your character and optimism are inspirational, in calls you'd be cheering up my and everyone else's day with your sense of humor while keeping all the pressure and pain to yourself, and that's truly an act of someone who only wants to see everyone happy. fact of the matter is that i will remember this little level made in a videogame when i'm well over my 60s, it was just that memorable. when you got 90 again that day, i felt hopeless, and i'm usually never like that, i would be the one cheering you up, i thought you'd eventually break and leave the level again for months, and as the curse goes with any my level verifications, you did it when i was asleep, the only time i decided to go to bed. you did it an hour later, because you believed that it was not over yet. you managed to prove everyone wrong, and even beat it on a refresh rate no one dares try a top 10 on. i believe this is the best project me and many others have worked on since the beginning of me playing this game, and i believe this is the best choice of verifier. gg cooper",After

Puzzle,Limbo,2020-09-11,"heres my interpretation. the boy is dead, but the sister isnt. i think the treehouse theory is true, but i think only the boy died in it. limbo is different from, but has pretty much the same concept as purgatory. purgatory is a realm between heaven and hell. it says the boy is unsure of the fate of his sister, which means he doesnt know if shes dead or not. so the whole game hes journeying through limbo trying to get back to the land of the living to see if shes there. apparently if you die in limbo, you die forever, as evidenced by none of the enemies ever returning and some intentionally killing themselves. the boy wasnt pure enough to get to heaven, and he wasnt evil enough to get to hell, so he ended up in the middle. the other humans he encounters are other souls, and theyre hostile because they are afraid of everything. anyway, since its a supernatural realm, it doesnt make sense. hence why theres a hotel and a factory area in it. ive heard some people say that the reason the boys eyes glow is because hes a ghost, and when he makes it to his sister, because theyre still glowing, hes dead or a ghost still, but i think thats not true. the other humans in limbo dont have glowing eyes either. im pretty sure his eyes only glow so that we dont confuse him with someone else or lose track of him. so. the ending. the glass breaking scene, i think, is symbolic of him breaking through to the land of the living. as a ghost or in his physical form, im not sure. theres a key detail here you can see the sister digging in the ground. digging the boys grave. she survived and the boy died. the reason the game ends with the boy getting to the girl is because, he made it. he got back to the land of the living and his sister. i know it looks grey and gritty, but i think thats symbolic of the grief shes going through after her brothers death. edit my theory is further supported by the achievement you get when you beat the game. perseverance has its own reward. a reward. also the glass breaking scene is pointless if not symbolic of the boy getting to another side. its not bright enough to be heaven, but it cant be limbo, because we just left there. its the land of the living.",After
Puzzle,Limbo,2022-04-06,"my theory is that the boy and girl run away from homethe city and all the industrialization and parentscontrol bugs live in the forest. to a kid water, older kids and bugs are scary so in limbo those are things that try to kill him the most. unfortunately because they are children they don't build a steady tree house and find whatever to build it, they both either fall though the flooring or one of them falls out of the trees. the menu screen has 2 sets of fliesboy and the girl that you would see if something dead or whatever attracts them was just lying there. it could have been that the girl or boy falls and dies while the other tries to save them dying in the possession as well. we all know that 6ft is all you need to kill someone or due, since they were so young that height in the tree will do the trick. the reason i think this i'd in the game certain heights that you wouldn't think to kill you does so you have to take account of your body and the height of things. so because no one knew where they were their bodies are rotting on the forest floor. they boy goes through limbo to meet with his sister again prolly because is the oldest and took his sister with him to runaway. the glass shards i think represents him finally leaving limbo and being able to be with his sister who is waiting at her death site burying the bodies. the fact that they can't actually do this in the living world. their dissaperanxes could mean a few things 1 the boy and girl assended or 2 because you can start the game over or even pick chapters means that they will never be able to leave and the cycle for them to try and meet will never become a reality until someone finds their bodies. the menu screen is just there to show where they died and how much time passed with he tree house.this is my main theory 2nd theory is simple, a man grows up living through war or war times and the only thing he liked or really loved was his deceased sister and childhood because of simple times. as he is dying he passes through limbo and goes through tribulations that impacted him in his life. this would explain the forest, older kids, the hotel and the factory. in limbo he sees his sister and tries to approach only to be mind controlled by the big representing things that annoyed him but couldn't break free from. at the end he finally finds her and they leave.the sister could also be alive since she doesn't have glowing eyes. the sister could also represent the things he loved but could never aquire, that could explain why we don't ever see him reach her.",After
