One of the deaths for six when she's going through the chef's level, is getting picked up and put into an oven, or a grinder. 
I don't think it makes any sense for the kids to be then turned into nomes instead, which doesn't really have much significance, and they're all roaming free anyway.",0

8jeUa895RMw,@Brodiemix,2025-01-04T14:20:04Z,"Here's what i think happened in the prequel: Six, in the very first timeline, may have been taken by another entity and trapped with the music box, which became her safe haven. When Mono broke into her chamber and destroyed the door to meet her for the first time, he might have disrupted her peaceful isolation. This could explain her initial hesitation to trust him, her reluctance to hold his hand, and her eventual betrayal. The destruction of the music box later in the story mirrors this, further fueling her resentment.

In the loop, the Thin Man replaces the original captor, symbolizing Mono's future self trying to communicate that Six is already content and doesn‚Äôt need saving. He traps her with the music box, intending it as a safe haven to break the cycle and prevent Mono from intervening. However, Mono misinterprets this and destroys the music box again, taking away her solace and perpetuating the cycle.

When Six leaves the TV, it‚Äôs symbolic of her distancing herself from Mono rather than breaking free from the loop itself. The TV represents Mono's entrapment‚Äîhis mind, his psychological struggle, and his cycle of repeatedly trying to save her. Six was never really tied to the loop in the way Mono was; the loop exists within his mind. By stepping away from the TV, she isn't escaping the loop but instead choosing to leave Mono behind, since he hurt her by destroying her music box (her safe haven). It could be that mono has a hero complex that pushes him to keep saving her even though she doesn't really want that which makes her even more hurt and betrayed",0

It is entirely possible that they could have a real relationship in this universe and they helped eachother through traumas as kids like orphanage, schools, doctors, teachers, businessmen, that they eventually hurt one another from all of the built on trauma of being two kids in love growing up with out parents turned them into the monsters we see them become !!",0

They are dressed up like a weirdo and wander around causing a lot of property damage, sometimes killing important people who are stuck mindlessly performing tasks. In the end they defeat the person who is sort of responsible for what is going on, and then they become the new person who is sort of responsible for what is going on. This results in the world either carrying on as if nothing has really changed, or rapidly getting much worse.

The broken mirror with her face not shown means that she's not really there and trying to chase away his inner thought which is 6.

rCXKiQgi-ho,@gamerexe7605,2024-12-08T04:12:10Z,"Weird, very unlikely theory, but I think that the names of the kids themselves might have been proof of time-based stuff from both games. 
Think about this, mono means 1. Six is the 6th of something. We see a hanging man in the start of LN1, and we know that the masked lady is likely Japanese because of how she looks and the style of the areas.
I think that Mono was the husband and Six was the wife and they were a Japanese couple immigrating during the time of WW2, but they couldn‚Äôt let Six in because she was unstable. Mono in sadness hung himself, and soon Six smuggles herself in.
There‚Äôs one thing to remember tho, this is WW2, and there‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre immigrating. The mothers of the two supported the expansion of imperial Japan, and the fathers both likely were kamakazi pilots. But there were two very separate ways that this goes about and it‚Äôs portrayed by the children in the game.
The wife turns murderous when being not allowed to leave the immigration area, taking her mother‚Äôs support of murder and continuing. The husband after seeing what her wife had done, kills himself. The wife followed the footsteps of both of their mothers and the husband followed both of their fathers. 
Further more, I don‚Äôt think that the husband was the best at love. He might have been a bit scary and that‚Äôs likely why he had 6 wives, the only one that stayed being the only one who had no one else because of how much of a loose cannon that she is",0

Yes, absorbing the life force of the guests might keep her alive, but maybe when she uses her powers on a child to turn them into the gnomes, that's how she gains youth. It's sort of like how witches used to be said to absorb youth from children or through eating them. Only difference here is that what remains are what is left of the children are gnomes who can only remember what they used to be.",0

SPOILERS FOR AN OLD MOVIE ""SPIRITED AWAY"".

This song/game is like a corruption of the Studio Ghibli film ""Spirited Away"". Where that film ends happily, it's easy for me to compare and Contrast 5 with Chihiro. Imagine a story were Chihiro fails to overcome her struggles, staying under Yubaba's thumb for the long term, while her parents wind up being eaten. Chihiro survives much, but her story taking a darker turn? She likely finds a way to usurp Yubaba. It might take decades, and she'll be twisted by the end of it, eventually usurping Yubaba. Not a happy ending by any means.",1

ZxZSsrMkRLo,@devius148,2025-02-03T19:18:11Z,"Hi, I just came up with the idea that IF Six is Otto‚Äòs older sister, this can also explain why she left Mono behind in the Signal tower.
Maybe Mono remembered Six of her younger brother Otto when she lifed in the Counties‚Ä¶ Her Brother she once left behind to Travel into the Nowhere and now she‚Äòs leaving him behind again, but this time it‚Äòs Mono.
I think that the thing Mono and Otto have incommon is that they don‚Äòt wanna be alone and both got left behind by Six.
Maybe she didn‚Äòt want to have a Little Brother at her side who would never let her go and so this is the reason she left them behind‚Ä¶

Is this relatable?",1

ZxZSsrMkRLo,@tubfellow,2024-09-24T12:51:05Z,"The corridor in LN2 isn‚Äôt the halfway point, is it not part of the tower? Mono as Thin Man is trying to get child Mono to free him, so that he may try to break the cycle. Also, in the comics, Mono sees Six get abducted and it shows that he specifically starts his adventure to save her. It is more likely that he came across the TV on the path, tried to do what he always does, and curiously try to get to the end of the hallway, before getting pushed out of the TV and thus the game begins for the player.

Also, things are twisted and misshapen because of Mono (Thin Man). The tower projects power and twists the world around it, as you can see with everything in the Pale City, as well as the Pale City itself. This is why the Thin Man is the only antagonist that is not twisted and deformed. It is also speculated that the more privileged individuals can afford to buy masks, that hide their deformities, which is why you see some wearing masks, and why you can see Roger‚Äôs (from the first game) mask in the 2nd game, and others like the Hunter having to wear a potato sack, as he most likely could not afford a mask.",0

Nobody really knows what‚Äôs happening. The only person who seems to have gotten close to defining what the Nowhere could be is Otto‚Äôs professor, which Otto later builds his research and theories on. But almost all of that was stated to be pseudoscience until Noone started disappearing from her bed.

I do think that Otto‚Äôs professor was right though. Reality is not the center of the universe. There is something beyond that. A true anchor that connects all realms and dimensions. We, limited by our consciousness, cannot interpret it. But dreams, especially those vivid nightmares experienced by children, are far more abstract. Enough to bring them there. They are divided from their conscious mind and the dreaming mind, until the dreaming mind has enough grip onto the other side to be pulled completely into the Nowhere.",0

ZxZSsrMkRLo,@eddouglas,2024-03-20T17:15:53Z,"MONO IS SIXES DAD (and the hunter character is Sixes Grandad/Monos Dad). It's all about Narcissism - a type of autism that tends to be generational, and is based on the afflicted either acting in parent mode (the children are often ""parentified"" - which means autistically coerced into parent mode whilst still children), or acting in adult child mode (where they act as children in the relationship, either when still a child or as an adult.).

SO MONO IS SIXES DAD. Hence she gets snatched up in HER OWN ROOM (HER TOY is that duck with wheels - drawing pictures on her wall of her own Dad, the Thin Man). There's a psychological struggle in their relationship of them both being the children, trying to save each other from generational autism trauma, whilst also Mono acting the Narcissistic father, something which must've happened to him.

I think each level is a lucid nightmare, of either Mono's story (being frightened in the Forest (a common motif for the subconscious), then bullied in school, then frightened of the weird Doctor, then becoming his Narcissist self and spreading his narcissism through the TV, creating the narcissist monster people that all want to suck the life out of each other, like a narcissist (think Bram Stoker's Dracula - another story about a Narcissist that steals people's essense, via curse, then replicates themselves by spreading the narcissist autism, and creates another vampire. Same premise).

So then Six becomes her own narcissist, via her lucid nightmare story - where Mono her Dad ends up hanging himself, and she navigates her own childhood trauma without him (another common cruety in narcissistic relationships is the parent will starve their own kids, creating Sixes hunger). So she eventually becomes a narcissist, like a vampire in old tales, sucking the life out of people and not really existing themselves. LN1 is six losing her Dad and becoming the Lady, or her own version of the narcissist autism.

It's all about narcissist personality disorder basically, a ""type 2 autism"" like being a psychopath All the hallmarks of narcissistic abuse, complete with parent/child mode mix ups, over focus on appearance like the Lady, people wearing masks (which is another way of describing a narcissist), people wanting to suck the life out of each other, in an almost addictive way.",0

1:20:15 I think Six made the decision to eat the poor thing because she thinks it's not another kid, it's something else, another species, so for her it was better to eat him than eat the sausage that she KNEW it was made of children. I believe we, as the player, think that she has committed cannibalism, but I don't think Six herself believes it was cannibalism. With that same reasoning, I don't think Six thought that eating the lady at the end of the game was cannibalism because she believes the adults are different species, too.",0

ifQX1pkIHd4,@DeadVampyres,2025-02-22T23:50:59Z,"I don't think Mono or Six are bad in any way.

Little Nightmares is a game that implies a lot of what it wants to say, and Six could potentially have known what that sausage was made out of, Guests or an amalgamation of children, whilst in contrast, she never knew Nomes were human to begin with.

The issue is, that we don't know why Six dropped Mono, why she ate the Nome, why Mono did not attempt to escape on his own despite having the power to manipulate the very space around him. And maybe we will never know, because the game is not made ""for children"", directly implying that in a world made of children's nightmares, we are only the observers, thus leaving us in the dark, because we don't belong in the Nowhere, leaving us with the best thing to do, staying morally grey, viewing every perspective, as that's all that can be done.",1
ifQX1pkIHd4,@maja.zaborowska_,2025-02-22T22:00:00Z,"1:56:43 hit harshly too close to home, I absolutely admire the way you speak and the way you analyse things, is amazing, being nearly a 17yo teenager I absolutely agree, there are points where you find the grotesque in this game just a surreal depiction of our own reality, wanting to think that our reality is so much more ""dreamier"" than this game but in reality, it just shows our perception on the world as young individuals, this game will I think always confuse me but as much as I watch analytical videos on this the more I love it even more, this is an amazing video on this game and maybe you should make a gameplay one when the third game comes out!!",3
ifQX1pkIHd4,@daemonbug,2025-02-21T05:39:08Z,"On the aspect of people defending Six, I will not say she doesnt do bad things, but what I think most people fail to recognise(because they dont have kids) is a child's capacity for things like manipulation, violence due to emotion, emotional misunderstanding, and the worst thing of all, impulses. kids dont have a control of impulses because they have not learned that you need to stop them to coexist, so if six was craving the nome over the sausage, im not surprised she chose the nome. that is to say, i think she craved the nome due to her hunger that was triggered by her split from the thin man, but nonetheless a child wouldn't compartmentalize that, she would think ""i want to eat that nome"" and she has no authority figure in this world, so, she does. So, with the case of mono, you do a succinct job of categorizing all the times mono fails for six, and yes, a kid would drop you for that, because they don't have a full conception of death even after experiencing death(I know i sure didnt as a kid). Sorry, just the way you went with that argument bothered me because there were some good points that I don't think were brought up.

Edit: I also want to mention, my headcanon for Six is that before she ended up in the nowhere she was in a mental institution; based on her clothes in very little nightmares(and her questionable actions), where I assume she first fully crossed into the nowhere, she has a full white outfit for some reason, but not a hospital gown, it reminds me of the sweats they would give kids in mental hospitals when they first come in. Not to mention, some of the ""questionable"" things that six does could be linked to autism (in my personal, autistic, opinion).",1

ifQX1pkIHd4,@tyagirodriguez4947,2025-02-18T00:07:27Z,"It's heavily implied that Six only starts feeling hunger after leaving the Signal Tower, like she had lost a part of her soul. This is why her hunger is growing, and each time she needs to eat something bigger and more alive, she's hungry for a soul. (Btw I do not defend her actions, I played the games in the order they came out and I will NEVER recover from the betrayal)",1
ifQX1pkIHd4,@_Nykolaii_,2025-02-13T22:35:38Z,"I think Mono's story is very interesting in a sense that... Mono was probably afraid of growing up. At the end, he accepts his fate, that he'll have to, that he can't stop it. And at the end, he becomes one. But when the door opens, his younger self opens, he chases after it, after that fleeting childhood, while terrible, had its moment mostly because of Six's company. Adult him is alone, trapped, in a world of nothing but flesh and eyes that he can only pretend are not there. How much we would give to go back...
His adult self took Six to the tower and gave her the music box. I think it's because he knew Six loved that music and, while this world twists everything, he probably tried to bring her comfort in all that, that's maybe why he chased after the 2: He wanted to help them (although this world makes it do more bad than good but you get the point as it is confirmed that while she was mutated, she was somewhat happy, which probably is why she betrayed you).
The hanged man maybe would refer to a breaking point. If we assume the cycle breaks, and instead of being perpetually living the cycle, Mono would've maybe done it. The door does have an eye oddly similar to his door's. The chair is too tiny for his huge body. I like the idea of his top body going up rather than down, where the light of the room is coming from.

And, the reason Six took the raincoat in LN2 is because she recognized it as RGs, and RG saved her in VLN. Six was trying to help RG with the boulder at the end, but the cliff ended up breaking.

ifQX1pkIHd4,@lizzyrank5405,2024-11-20T15:28:31Z,"I said this in another comment. I see little nightmares as a cautionary tale of what happens when the cruelty of the world touches children. Some become the thing they fear the most. Some embrace it and some die ofnit, if they dont survive. Theres plenty of people who have gotten out of their situation a better person. Unfortunately there are too many people who fall prey. Six dropping Mono was prolly that. She fought really hard to escape only for Mono to embrace the powers and possibilities wanting to grow up fast so he could use them more effectively. Every time he would try to get closer shed pull him back. A great representation of when kids bully others or have physical outbursts and not know how to control themselves. Eventually she saw how everytime hed fall hed embrace the powers from the tv, mirroring the powers and possibly the cruelty of the adults, until she couldn't handle it. Its better to drop him hoping he dies rather than have to deal with another monster especially someone who went through the same things and was afriend if not someone she survived with. At the same time prolly not recognizing her own dark side. If she did, she had it more in control, but even she fell. Each time she survived an encounter shed grow stronger but at the same time her dark side would grow, until she did the unthinkable and actively hirt someone (eating the nome) out of desperation and survival instincts. Enacting the same cruelty that was done to her. Obviously she felt guilty.  But by the end of the game Im assumeing she just gave in becoming the thing she desperately DID not want to be unlike mono who did use the powers willingly. At the end of the first game its not a triumphant time. People are now afraid of her and leaves her alone but shes now alone having to continue and possibly becoming another ""mom"" figure perpetuating the cycle of violence. I think thats why no one in the little nightmare games has a happy ending even if they win. 
They either get abandoned like mono because they are too similar to the cruel adults, offed like the nomes and children or push those away like Six. I think six is not like the other children because she might be the child of the mother figure in the 1st game. Or at least a part of it on some way. She might even be able to see the cycle unlike the other children until they are adults.

 These are the majority if not the most talked about stories of people living ine dangerous cruel and hostile environments as children.",4
ifQX1pkIHd4,@user-of9um8eq7j,2024-11-20T12:30:15Z,"I saw another video explaining the painting's on the wall. It's just a theory!

The lady had two children. A son and a daughter. The painting on the wall was the daughter and the painting covered was the sons painting.

The daughter: 
The daughter is not six and it was confirmed that six had no tie with the lady. The actual daughter was that granny in the DLC. 
If you look at the painting you can see she is wearing a yellow dress, some might think she is six because of this but no she is not. That same dress can be found on a piece of wood near the water by the granny. The granny outgrew the dress as she aged and discarded the dress, she ended us using another dress she found from the bodies (this can explain why it didn't fit her so well). 
The reason why she was locked down there is complicated, if l can remember well from that video he explained ""it was to protect her"". The lady was feeding off of young kids to stay young herself. So the lady locked her daughter away to protect her from the mother's hunger for youth. There are more details but l seriously can't remember. All l remember is that the mother stayed young as the daughter grew old.

The son:
The son betrayed his mother, that is why the photo was covered. The son found out what the mother was doing and ran away. As he ran away he would soon fine out that the outside world aka pale city wasn't not wonderful at all. Stuck on not knowing what to do he kizzed himself. He couldn't go back home after the betrayal and he couldn't stay in the pale city aswell so he wrote a note and ended himself.

Why the lady acted differently to the run away kid:

This is a weird topic but it kinda supports why the granny was the ladies daughter. When six was caught by the lady, the lady was still composed. She didn't go ""crazy"" when she saw six.

BUT with runaway she went absolutely mad. Some say it wasn't because he saw her face but because he kizzed the granny aka her daughter. 

Another theory is that the lady knew dark magic and that is why there were many books scattered everywhere. She found a way to stay young forever... But at what cost? It is well known how beautiful she was from the painting on the walls. So why smash all the mirrors? Some believe it was because of guilt. Many young lives had been destroyed because of her, she was a monster and she knew it. That face you see in the mirror (DLC) could be her actual face or what she is underneath all the dark magic. She was so consumed by being young, that her own kids weren't safe. So her daughter was locked away and the son ran away. 

There was a family painting of her and the daughter. The painting seemed unfinished because of the right hand side it looked like someone was missing. That was the son that was taken out of the painting because of his betrayal. 

That is all the information l remember from that video",3

But we do have one thing that I think connects much better to the fear of faceless hunters specifically. In Sweden we have ""allemansr√§tten"" (""all man's law"") which means you can walk freely in any forest, pick berry's and mushrooms and camp there for at least one night. It's amazing and I, as well as many other Swedish children spent a lot of time in forests. But hunters can also be in these forests, when you walk around you might see a hunters tower and I remember having to wear reflective vests on during hunting season so we wouldn't be mistaken for animals. Hearing distant gunshots in the forest and being afraid of a hunter mistaking you for an animal was pretty terrifying, thankfully accidents like that are very rare but the fear is still there. That's why I think they have the faceless hunter, you never really see them, just hear their shots and see their towers. Hope the cultural context was helpful:)",278

You can see from the guests that something alive seems to trigger an even greater gluttony, and that the regular meat is not longer interessting if Six is there. 
When Six met the gnome, it was alive. I always interpreted it as her not knowing how to help herself. That at some point dead meat or bread simply wasn't enough anymore to satisfy her hunger. 
I didn't interpret it as Six willingly killing someone even though she had the chance to eat something else. 
It always looked to me as if she, like the guests, was forced to do that.  Perhaps triggered by the power of the Lady. That this power forces people to eat. Or rather forces people to eat human flesh, preferably living human flesh. I also assume that Six no longer feels this hunger in the end.

She went through the kitchens, she MADE sausages herself in order to progress. She knew without a shadow of a doubt that the sausage was people meat. The Nome, however, was an unknown. Hell, most of US wouldn‚Äôt have known if not for the DLC. It‚Äôs ridiculous to assume Six is aware that the Nomes are children. And even if she did, it‚Äôs evident that her hunger is supernatural in nature, likely requiring an escalation of foods to sate. The bread, then meat, then a live rat, then the Nome, and finally the Lady. She did not have a choice. Hell, I would have made the same decision knowing only what she knew.
Sorry, I just get very passionate about Six considering every other person wants to put her in a paper shredder when that‚Äôs literally not even a fifth grader we‚Äôre talking about. She‚Äôs not a monster. She‚Äôs 9 years old, extremely traumatized, and trying to survive in a world that hates her. And wouldn‚Äôt you know, but extremely traumatized people tend to act irrationally.",24

When Six and Mono are being chased by the Thimono and he grabs Six, there is a moment where Six reaches out for Mono under the bed, he tucks his head in and Six is grabbed. 

The area where Six is found clearly shows that a considerable amount of time has passed, she‚Äôs in a time distorted place. She is forced out of a trance, has to run for her life and in the final moments when Mono needs help, she lets go. 

Is she warped? Has this played out before? When Six needed a hand to not be taken, did she feel betrayed? She had nothing but time to think about those final moments. 

Mono the power to repel and Six the power to intake. Maybe that‚Äôs her answer to go get mono? A black hole to time distortion",0

Since Six saw the Nome as some type of animal, oblivious that it was an actual child, she thought it would probably be normal to eat him instead.

But, here's MY theory: She was driven into insanity at the Maw and was easily influenced to eat things that were far from normal. This place somehow in some way gave her a message to EAT or be EATEN. Maybe that's why she didn't hesitate to eat the bitch (The Lady). But anyway, that's just my theory. :)",0

wxeVIg-PSDI,@Quomvi,2023-03-25T03:32:08Z,"This was the scariest part of the game for me, especially because she looks exactly like a teacher we had that was also just awful, she was a science teacher, and she clearly hated children, she didn't accept longer times to give the homework in important times (once there was a student that had an urgent travel, and he told her and she said that she was gonna give him a different work to do, and when he came back after like a week she already gave him a minimum result even after she said that she was gonna give him a different exam). 

Even the intelligent one in the class hated her, because one day he had a perfect exam like he usually did, and she took points because of a punctuation error in a science exam that wasn't supposed to focus on grammar, we compared answers, and his answer was right, it was just because of one error in an area that wasn't even supposed to count in that class). 

My school had awesome teachers and through my 12 years there i only hated two, one being her (like seriously, even the parents hated her because her class always had the worst scores even for the best students, i think she was fired after some years).",1

E91AS5ggHZM,@MarcusConstantine_Cavalida21,2025-02-04T12:27:47Z,"I've always thought that Little Nightmares was a philosophical commentary on children's fears of adults and growing up, as well children's issues with one another. 

Mono and Six's story parallel the Genesis story of Adam and Eve. Love, adventure, and fall from grace. The innocence dies and the youth grows up into the very system that oppressed them.

God is present in the world of Little Nightmares. They are the developers. The Father, the creator of that world. We are the players, the Son, the one that leads the characters through the game, hoping for a happy ending, as Jesus does for mankind. But against the Son's hope for man, the flesh is weak and all man is caught up in this vicious cycle of hope and failure. Men hating women. Old hating young.

But we will come again when the time is right.",0

My theory is that six after dropping mono returns to the maw and grows up much like Mono did because that how aging work Duh, besides that explained in the video the same music/melody that‚Äôs played or hummed by both of them and in the last fight with the lady you can hear Sasha six‚Äôs heart beat.

E91AS5ggHZM,@bendyinkdemon3094,2025-01-07T00:21:08Z,The only problem with the first game being a time loop is the creators confirmed Six isn‚Äôt related to the lady in any way nor is she a version of her plus Six leaves the Maw right after killing the lady and several guests so what would her purpose be for going back after she‚Äôs an adult? Mono however could be on a time loop or they could be doing a similar plot to pirates of the Caribbean where whoever kills the captain of the Dutchman becomes the new captain because the ship needs a captain it cannot be without one so Mono killing the Thin Man could have automatically made him the new thin man because the signal tower needs someone to be the thin man to continue doing whatever it is the tower actually does,0

I‚Äôm not saying people can‚Äôt headcanon it, cuz there are some people who make it work smoothly, but it‚Äôs just something I never saw. Like, why would Six stay on the Maw when this whole time she‚Äôs been fighting for freedom? Why does every living child HAVE to become an existing monster when they grow up?

Meanwhile at the maw there is a reason to go there, being the food, and the janitor actually cleans up stuff which is helpful, and the chefs actually prepare the food properly, etc. So there's seemingly an actual reason that they do stuff that isn't because of the simple reason that's what their job was were like before they were warped into the residents",31

I think the eye fed off his fear and/or comfort. I think the eye, similar to the dream demon in Demon Slayer or Genjutsu in Naruto, creates an illusion or dream for the child meanwhile feeding off of him/her. Eating the child's energy. The room itself is an organism very similar to the Mugen Train in Demon Slayer. Six had her music box for comfort but the room started peeling back into that eye entity's true self after Mono started to destroy the box which was the source of the power. 

I think kids in that realm are powerful. They just don't know what the hell that realm is. Except for Six, I have a few theories. Instead of siphoning power off her it was siphoning off her box. Maybe because 1. She wasn't strong enough yet or 2. Her blood isn't a pure human's blood (I'll elaborate on this theory in a bit). She has ties to the lady in The Maw, or so we are led to believe. Maybe this Entity doesn't dare to (even though it did try) or simply can't siphon power off Six because she isn't from Earth or for other reasons unknown like a protection spell on her, maybe?

In the audio story on Spotify we know the kids are from Earth. That's all I'll say in this case careful to not spoil to anyone who hasn't listened to the audio stories.

Six isn't a good source of energy being that she isn't a pureblood. Earthblood, if you will. She manifests her powers only later when she takes it from the Geisha who we believe she is a part of her lineage. Working evidence to this can be in the room Six is sitting inside, winding up her music box in her monster like form at the tower, a picture can be found of Six with her face scribbled off. This can be one of her fears the Eye is feeding off. The same fear the Geisha has. There is a hidden small apartment room inside the Pale City with broken mirros and a Geisha statue. I think this room belonged to the Lady in the Maw. Six either was sold and left or ran away and captured. Either way her decision to go to The Maw could be driven by revenge. Six could also be of royalty blood in that realm so the Eye couldn't manifest Six into a proper being with powers simply because of her blood or because of some spell the Geisha has put on Six since birth? Why would she abandon Six though? I think there is still so much story purposely not fleshed out BUT definitely present in these games. 

Or the writers might shift through our comments and pick the best lore we come up with and steal our ideas üòÖ

All the adults in the game could also just be the kids that grew up and turned into monsters. 


Lastly, back to Mono. Mono could be stuck in a time loop. Like the first time we played the game, we nor Mono have no knowledge ad what is to come or become of him as we embark on this journey. He is, however, present in front of a TV at the beginning of the game. Mono could very well have memory of what happens with some black spots. These black spots could be whenever he first encounters the TVs. He's being drawn in but doesn't know why and he covers his head (in fear?) just how he covers his head in fear when he first sits down on the chair when all the eyes start to close in on him. When Mono defeats the Tall Man he disappears into thin air. I believe he disappears into the forest as a kid again, at the beginning of the game. I just don't know how. 

The Tall Man, feels the presence of Mono and recognizes him right away. He calls out to him via the TVs. This is his chance to save himself of the tragedy that befalls (is that a word?) him at the hand of the kid that betrayed him; the girl in the yellow raincoat, Six. The Tall Man didn't know he would get this chance. As a kid, as Mono, he didn't recognize himself as an adult nor did he know why it is that these two were linked via these TVs. So of course this Mono wouldn't either. Nor did he plan this out. He won't remember which floor panels he hid under as a kid, nor retrace which vents he climbed through so he can catch up with him. He was an old man now. Memories so thin and not tall enough (lol get it? Thin Man/Tall Man okay I'll stop). The only way to prevent this from happening to his younger self is grabbing Six! Fueled by a new cycle of blind revenge the Tall Man would proceed to capture Six and unknowingly repeat this cycle over again. 

Now a dark theory I have is that the Tall Man broke Six's arm which is why it's all mangled up in her monster form. The same arm she used to let go of Mono. It's possible because after the train crashes the Tall Man isn't on your tail anymore. Maybe he briefly went back or... or MAYBE THE EYE DID IT AND IN THE FORM OF THE TALL MAN OR MONO SO SIX CAN DROP HIM WHICH REPEATS HISTORY AGAIN!!!! ü§Ø

and about the little shadows of every kid, they could be their souls or just remnants... Six's shadow seemed to have a will of it's own. Royal blood? Just strong enough for her soul/shadow to coincide in this realm 



But that's just a theory....

625pnIgYqnI,@Haxicab,2025-02-01T04:59:07Z,"I think that children are probably more powerful in the Nowhere, which is why they are lured there in the first place. Maybe it is their imagination. But to me, this would explain some issues that I've had with various theories, particularly with Mono. It never really made sense to me that child Mono would be able to easily defeat the older version of himself. It's possible then, that the original Thin Man was a manifestation of Mono's biggest nightmare (which we know is monophobia, the fear of being alone). The Thin Man takes Mono's only friend and turns her against him, ultimately leading to him becoming his biggest nightmare. Perhaps if the children stay too long in the Nowhere, they gain power(s) and control, something that children do not have in the real world, and could pose a threat to the being that lures them there in the first place (maybe that's what the eye motif represents).",0

625pnIgYqnI,@Poison_Berry_Rose,2025-01-29T00:28:46Z,"Okay, so. I‚Äôve had a theory for a while now, and I think that paired with this theory, could explain EVERYTHING. 

So, we know that the kids go to Nowhere when they fall asleep, which explains the kids. But what about the monsters? I think I figured it out: the kids are children in juvenile hall, aka prison for minors. And Nowhere is literally a nightmarish purgatory with sinners that look like monsters. Here me out: each of the monsters have either one or multiple characteristics that represent some of the seven deadly sins and a few crimes. The Guests is pretty obvious: Gluttony and cannibalism. The Janitor is a bit more vague. He has long arms because he started stealing money from the school‚Äôs bank, but after a while, he was caught by one of the students. He killed the student, and since he was a janitor, he had the right materials to clean it up. So his sins were greed and wrath, and his crimes were murder and stealing. The Lady is vain, and willing to keep her beauty by any means necessary. So her sins are envy and wrath, while her crimes were murder and possibly stealing. The Viewers are lazy, but become angry when their television shows are interrupted. Their sins are sloth and wrath, and their crimes are murder and possibly even arson. Now what about the kids? Mono‚Äôs design leads me to believe that his sins are wrath and maybe even greed. He is shown to attack many enemies, sometimes without hesitation. He also likes to pickpocket small objects, so maybe his crimes are battery and theft. Six is pretty obvious: her sins are gluttony and greed, since she is shown to steal small things as well. So maybe her crimes were stealing food, and possibly even cannibalism. I‚Äôll also include the Pretender as one of the kids. Her sins are clearly envy and wrath, since she is shown to have many dolls, and if the kid withe red scarf is anything to go by, her dolls are made from the clothes of past kids. And when she gets mad, she flies into a rage, attacking anything and everything. So maybe her crimes are battery, theft, and possibly even murder. But that‚Äôs my theory, what do you guys think?",0

OR what if Monos nightmare was to become like the Thin Man? in the real world he has an abusive father (lets just say that) and Monos fear is to become like his father, and yet in the nightmare he became like him. 
(If someone related to Mono was abusive yet, maybe a scientist or someone who works in an office, that would explain the signal tower. But since Mono is related to them, he would probably know so many secrats.. maybe he knows why the children are obducted into the nightmares, his relative obducts them and does tests on them. And mono found a way into the nowhere and tries to save them. like he tried with six, (who is probably the only sucsesful expreiment for now), but mono gets trapped in the nightmares as the new Thin Man. he became what he feard)",0

This process repeats itself endlessly by replacing the fallen like the lady was killed and her abilities were summed by the six. As for the thin man he secured his position to a check point that depends on ilwill/goodwill but that opportunity may not reaccur again because I think six decently knows what she's doing it's unlikely her shadow self just helps her to get out of the spiral but to take over it later on. We gotta see one of two truly main stories here other than a few mids. 
The real story would be about the 1st lady or the last.

Well it's sorta hell in which troubled children adapt to using their own judgement based on the environment.

Like what if the girl came to the maw,became the Lady,started doing...whatever she does and then she found the raincoat girl(not six or the one in vln) in the maw,she also recognised her as one trapped here and so she tries to keep her safe too.Maybe she tried to escape because the lady already lot her mind that point or slowly loosing it.And that girl also slowly turned into the granny.
Yes there are a lot of ""gap"" in this theory but i am sure some or many can figure it out",3

36 cm = 14 inches 
46 cm = 18 inches 
60 cm = 1 feet 11 inches (a bit bigger then a newborn baby)
61 cm = 2 feet
62 cm = 2 feet (not very noticeable difference to 61 cm)
60 - 66 cm = 1 feet 11 inches - 2 feet 1 inches
176 cm = 5 feet 9 inches (roughly the size of a 13 year old)
179 cm = 5 feet 10 inches (roughly the size of the average man)
210 cm = 6 feet 10 inches
214 cm = 7 feet
221 cm = 7 feet 3 inches 
225 cm - 229 cm = 7 feet 4 inches - 7 feet 6 inches 
226 - 230 cm = 7 feet 4 inches - 7 feet 6 inches 
231 cm = 7 feet 6 inches 
236 cm = 7 feet 8 inches 
246 cm = 8 feet

e6L9a6tJA8I,@SmoothRiverRocksRock,2025-02-10T04:19:15Z,"YOOOOO I adore all the details on this animatic! At first I thought the hand gestures at the beginning were asl words, but the moment I realized they were shadow puppets had my mind blown! I love how you portray all these kids together, both with their game's respective light sources and with how they interact with one another.

I particularly love how kind of... indifferent(?) Runaway Kid and Raincoat girl feel towards Six. They tell Mono things, probably the things Six did, but it doesn't feel like they're judging her. It's like they kind of understand her, or at least pity her in a way, and they reserve the judgement for Mono to make. Usually people will make Runaway Kid some sort of aggressive towards Six, and I like that you didn't go that route with this animation. Makes it feel like all the kids in this world understand that everything is for survival's sake, and they don't fault Six for doing what she thought would keep her alive

 ALSO!!!! THE WAY SIX LOOKS LIKE SHE'S CRYING WHEN SHE RUNS!!!! MY HEART----",1

The predatory aspect of the gluttons reflects the irrational hunger of humans. The way they are easily provoked by moving prey even surrounded by plenty reflects the quality of humans that are never satisfied with what they have.

The lady is not preserving her looks, the purpose of the mask is to shield her appearance from onlookers. She smashes all the mirrors in her house and hides them in a storage because she cannot stand the sight of herself as she is, while hanging portraits around the house to remind her of what she once was (and can never be again). The boy from the second game glimpses her scarred and dissheveled form and she turns him into a gnome in her rage. It's not clear that the lady is elderly, but her veneer is clearly scarred and misshapen.

The picture of the little girl in the lady's chamber could be the lady herself. The granny could have been a matriarch or parental figure to the lady in time's past, or one of the geishas. It seems odd that the lady would kill all of the other geishas but leave one to rot away in a watery place within the bowels of the Maw. My theory is that the granny is forced to stay there to be hidden, lest the lady discover that she's alive.",0

IIJ_zmFkDM0,@CharleeOnorio,2025-01-21T14:51:33Z,"I get this guys idea, but I think six is the lady and it's a time loop where when the lady gets eaten by six, six will become the next lady and eventually another six will come and and eat the last six that was the last lady and then they will become the lady. That would also explain the thin man and how mono becomes the thin man. Eventually there will be another mono who will be a thin man. Thats thevreason why the thin man never kills mono he just picks him up to stop him because he knows if mono keeps on following six, then mono would have to suffer being the thin man. If you think about it, the lady hums the exact song from the music box in the second one because she felt safe when she was with the music box, and that is why mono gets dropped by six, because six is mad that mono took her away from the music box which was the one thing that made her feel safe. If you think about it, doing the same thing over and over with the time loop always ending up with a bad ending that is the same bad ending no matter how hard you try to end up with the happy ending it cant happen, if you think of all if that, it showsvhow that is the definition of a nightmare.",0

This is the fifth lady of the maw‚Ä¶and SIX is the one who becomes the sixth. The locations in the nowhere don‚Äôt function like your average home. These paintings weren‚Äôt placed by the lady. The signal tower wasn‚Äôt placed by the thin man. They‚Äôre just there, a part of the nowhere itself. I think it‚Äôs these memories of the previous ladies that caused this painting to show up.",0

IIJ_zmFkDM0,@dannyguitarra6531,2025-01-19T12:02:16Z,"To further entertain this theory... it could have been the case that the lady couldn't live with the thought of losing another child and imprisoned her little girl. In doing so, she grew a toxic love and hate kind of grudge for her son and the children she captured, in general. The lady loses her marbles. Singing lullabies that she sang to both her children, collecting porcelain dolls, in remembrance of her children, synonymous to the 'love' she has for them. Also, it can be that her collecting kids is a sick illusion that she may have had in wanting to find, and see her son again. But they will never be him. So she kills them, to survive, and continue to live this illusion. An illusion that she wants and for years has consumed her. It drains her. So as the guests are glutinous, for their desires, so too does the lady eat, for hers. A more sinister desire. Similar as to what you said. It may also be somewhat of a psychological cycle. The son that left is the reason she remains alive. Consuming children in an ever ending echo chamber, where she obsesses over her missing son, and obsesses to stay alive, to continue to obsess over this hopeless hope of finding him. Angry at the fact that he left or that she lost him, she eats the children, expressing her anger, fortifying her will to continue. Obsessing over acting out a punishment for her son that caused her ongoing torment, and maybe even doing it out of guilt. I feel that although she seems younger looking than the little girl, she looks exactly how she sees herself in the dlc. Reflecting over what she has become. All the while, she mourns her son, cries because she can not stop this obsession, and punishes herself with her actions. Punishes herself by enslaving herself in this fate. Another thing is that she is also the source of the Nomes. And as she is the source, she is the main 'No me'. The main one that is lost, or mentally gone. Truely, this would be one hell of a tragedy. A very sick tragedy. I feel sorry for her now, lol. Man, you opened up a can with this theory, lmao. Great assortment of ideas you thought of, bro. 

One more thing. I recently went to Japan and very near the Tokyo Tower there is a park where they have many statues of children with red hats and scarfs. There is a plaque that I took a picture of that reads: ""These are ""care dieties of children"". They are dedicated for the safety growth of children, and grand children, as well as for the memorial service for still birth or miscarried children. To protect and keep warm their heads ""red had"" ""red apron"", and ""windmill"", were dedicated to the guardian diety of children image"". This is what they translated it to mean. I couldn't help to relate this to the fact that the fictional lady character is portrayed as a Geisha, or Japanese, and she had porcelain dolls ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The lady having a lot of mannequins, can also be synonymous to something. Herself, the children... I don't know.",0
IIJ_zmFkDM0,@ShmungusDa3rd,2025-01-16T04:50:54Z,"Although you are probably right, my favorite theory was the loop theory. It helps (even tho it's probably wrong) my brain rap around it. So it has to do with both games, if Mono is in this loop than would it not be the same for Six as well. Th a ts why the lady captures or changes the children into nomes so six does not take the place as the lady once again.

some parts about the theory of the hanging man being the lady's son is a bit confusing. if this is the lady's daughter's twin brother than shouldn't they be the same age? we know that the lady's daughter is the granny so obviously shes very old, but looking at the twin brother's legs and feet (if he is the hanging man) he doesn't look as old as his twin sister. maybe the water/environment the twin sister is in ages her especially? idk im confused about that",0

And can I please get and explanation on the time of events??? Is little nightmares 2 the events that happened BEFORE six took down The Lady or after? And not to mention the beginning of both Mono and Six story was odd. She WOKE UP as if she had a nightmare while Mono had some type of ability to mess with the frequency of TVs and not only that but bro technically spawned in from one lol,0

Like we do see a school and orphanage in LN2 but even then a lot of the ""kids"" are either those like Six and Mono, or dolls meant to resemble kids. The Maw even seems to be a kind of luxury dinery/hotel, that's why the residents were all so desperate to eat the kids rather than the fresh food in front of them. They main meat which seems to be made from their own kind is given as an appetizer while the luxury dish are the kids they're holding captive. That's why the janitor doesn't kill you immediately and why the chefs immediately turn you into a meal.",0

Throughout the game they would help eachother. Until they reached this man called the thin man. They defeat him but soon after Mono makes a jump only catching Six's hand luckily.  Six drops him it's unclear why but personally I think she was using him to get her to the end or because she saw what was going to happen. When she drops Mono he becomes the thin man and trapping himself in a time loop. Six on the other hand becomes a cannibal. Yay",0

VaoPKZSX0SM,@Stepp_Playz,2023-07-18T07:15:06Z,"I know what the guests eat and u find out throughout the game:
You will find the janitor in chapter 2 wrapping kids in those paperthingies, then he hangs them onto a catroll.

In the beginning of chapter 3, the kitchens,  you see the catrols again where you have to hang onto. Sometimes theres one of the bags with kids in them hanging on a rod.
Also, the catrols lead to the kitchens.
You all know what happens in kitchens...

Then in the end of chapter 3 you have to hang on another catrol throughout the washroom.
Once you survive the chase scene of the chefs, you hang onto a catrol.
That catrol leads to chapter 4: the guests

We also saw that the chefs use children to fill food like the fish in the main kitchen. That's one of the death scenes.

The food that the guests eat is most-likely also filled with kids.

The kids in the beds in chapter 1 end up in chapter 4

Also, we see a guest getting chopped off so I think that they use the guests for meat. How else do they get meat on a giant boat on the sea?

Also, the guests are chanting something at the start of chapter 4. If you listen closely you can hear them singing 'come and chop me off'.
Now if this isnt enough evidence I dont know what is.",24

0U2vfS6jD1E,@TheEndless935,2024-12-03T10:18:25Z,"Funny far fetched theory, what if Six was the main antagonist of this game?

Ik, extremely far fetched but still fun to think about",0
