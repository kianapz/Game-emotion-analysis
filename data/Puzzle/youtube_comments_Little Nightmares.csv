Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-19,i've been waiting for this moment
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-09,say whats popinn
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-02,the point of six eating the gnome was to show that her hunger was growing. thats why everything she ate was bigger and more alive than the previous thing and every time her stomach growled it hurt worse and worse
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,six just having the most absurd girl dinners
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,"when you lure the doctor into the incinerator, you can let him stay there, you will get an achievement called its crueler to let him live"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-31,"while the colour yellow does represent joy, happiness, creativity and curiosity along with other nice things. it also represents betrayal and dishonesty."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-17,my reflection does a lot of damage to me too
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-03,"runaway kid deserved to live, he was so close to escaping the ladys quarters man it wouldve been cool to see him go against the guests too"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-27,1137 if you turn the light on these gnomes you'll see their shadows as normal kids
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-04,"my favorite theory is why six has such an immense hungry in the first game. after the events of little nightmares ii when she escaped the tower, she lost a part of herself, hence the glitchy shadow version of herself. she lost a part of her, thus she grew a strong hunger to try and fill that part of herself that was gone fill in the missing piece, thats why she goes to the maw. she dreams of the lady, to steal her powers so six can steal the life force of other beings. so she could try to regain that part of herself that was lost in the tower."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-30,"kinda funny how she slowly gets corrupted more and more, the first death was something she couldn't stop, the second one was definitely on her, and the third one was because she just had no morality left."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-12,the elite scream when the guest fell i cant
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-19,"1529 ah yes, so let me just eat the kid that's alive instead of the one that's already dead. i'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't know the nomes were children but then why would you eat the creatures that you have been hugging the whole time?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-21,"recently came back into my little nightmares era lol. this video helped me understand so much about the lore. thank you, this deserves more views and likes."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-01,"man i had never looked at how the little nightmares dlc ended before, that last scene with the gnome and the sausage hit me like a truck..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-31,"i personally think that six betraying mono could be for any number of reasons, perhaps multiple, but it all boils down to her being a very, very flawed person. not that her character is badly made, but that she has some warped perceptions of the world. she's a kid in a really fucked up world, and she's just trying to survive. she's not necessarily a bad person, she's still growing up. but she's not some saint that has all these logical and reasonable excuses for her actions either. mono put her through all these dangerous situations and ripped her from her fantasy, sure. but whether she likes it or not, he helped her escape from a life trapped in her own delusion, and kept her as safe as he reasonably could in multiple dangerous situations so that they could escape together. she probably knows that, deep down. but her psyche is just too messed up for a kid her age, and so, she gives into bad choices."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,"i like to believe that one of the thin men realized that he was in a time loop, and in a last effort to stop the loop, killed himself so that the younger him could live normally i guess if you consider this world normal"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-30,she realized the sausage was made outta human meat but then continues to eat a human rip runaway kid
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-18,"1008 six is shown to hold grudges throughout the game. paying close attention, six attacks the bully out of pure hatred. and as stated, six's perspective was different from mono's, and technically he betrayed her first. before thin man took six, six reaches out to mono, while mono backs away and continues hiding under the bed very smart and good hiding spot mono. six could've perceived this as a betrayal i know i would. and again, six is shown to hold grudges. six didn't drop mono because she's an asshole, she drops mono because he betrayed her first. though, it's kinda an ass move to drop him off of a cliff however the thin man could've just as easily killed six like he did the other children."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-31,"this is easily one of my all time favorite games, the story it tells is so good and well told while still giving the player the chance to fill in the blanks however they see fit. and as you play i feel like you really get to become attached to the characters so all the twists hit even harder. i remember the first time i saw the ending of ln2. i still haven't recovered. still one of the most impactful moments in gaming i've ever experienced. 1010 experience, i think everyone should play these games at least once."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-23,"i'm almost certain six betrayed mono because he destroyed her music box. i always thought this was true right from the beginning. remember, at first six was calm when she saw mono again. she even placed her music box in front of mono to show him. but what does he do? he destroys it. bashes with a hammer. that would have torn her little heart apart. she then goes after mono, protects it from him. and like you said, she didn't hesitate from killing mono as long as her music box is safe. when she turned back to normal, you could just feel the tension. how she slowly gets up and stares down at mono. menacingly. of course mono did that to save six, i mean of course he did. he was trying to save his friend. but sadly, mono didn't understand or know how much the music box meant to six. only six knew that and no one else. six did like mono. she really did. but mono destroyed her music box. it was over for him in her eyes. especially with her personality."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-07,"considering that mono and six have different perspectives.in six's perspective it might be one of the 3 theories why she betrayed mono.but for mono his perspective washe was betrayed by the person he risked his life to save,the only person that he considered a friend,and because of that his anger and power grew as he grows up.ultimately he became the thin man.his power allowed him to go back in time to try and save his young self from six."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-23,no way this isnt popular
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-22,the way she shares her music box when shes in the signal tower i'm tearing up it's so cutee
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-15,what is so funny is that every one is screaming when six lets mono go but jack is just speechless
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-19,"for the people who missed it, at 1138 you can see the nomes have human shadows, meaning that they all had the same fate as the run away kid"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-30,the only two legit heroes in little nightmares is the original raincoat wearer and runaway kid.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-13,"1015 i think the reason for six's betrayal is because she sees the resemblence of mono and the thin man... there's more, six isn't just looking into monos face, she's getting power from him before she leaves him. this is because six does not have the powers that mono has and needs enough to go into the tv."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-15,"i think the reason six dropped mono was to take his power, because the exit was a tv and she can't get threw that. why i think that is because at the end if little nightmares 1 she got the lady weak and took her powers so i feel like it makes sense lol."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-21,"six really became the most hated character in little nightmares history, not like she didn't deserve it"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-01,"my own 100 cope headcannon is that six droped mono due to a combination of the grudge for breaking the music box, the glitchy six, and the influence of the tower. i interpreted the glitchy six as her losing a piece of her being, which is why she became the monster so fast, the tower essentially filled the missing piece and transformed her into that thing the creepiest thing in the game imo. something i'm pretty sure everyone can agree that the tower is alive and wants monothe thin man to maintain the signal, and is probably maintaining the time loop and is sustained by it. as i already said, i believe that the tower can influence six easily because of the missing piece and nudged, i can't really say forced when six has a motive, to reinacte the lion king with mono. the missing piece thing is also what i use to justify six's hunger for things that are alive, things with a soul. i'm not going to talk about the time loop because i could spend days writing and not get through half my thoughts about it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-29,"rip runaway kid!! that's so messed up of six to eat him like that. even if the sausage was human meat at least its cooked?? she'd rather eat a living breathing gnome, tf??"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-26,man i learned so much about the lore from this video and i loved the editing too idk why you're not getting the views you should be getting lol
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-01,am i the only one who heard mono say jesus christ! when the teacher sticks her head in the vent?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-16,"this video should have over 100,000 views. i love the work you put into the details. please, keep it up."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-22,"love the vid! btw, the part you were talking about six getting to the maw, you mentioned the comics... the comics were debunked by the devs and confirmed to not be canon. hope this helps!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-03,lol best explanation vid i've seen was confused when saw vid wasn't popular
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-05,"both mono and six have a vision of the main villain. mono sees the thin man which is just himself or more so someone who was exactly like him. so, i have a theory that six becomes the lady after she collects more power and goes back to the maw and stays there and everything eventually repeats. but idk the whole story is messed up but yet so good."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-09,i honestly wish sixs name was seven so i could do the why was six afraid of seven? because seven eightate ninethe cone head joke
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-08,"fun fact mono doesn't go in the hunter's cabin for no reason! in the little nightmares comics the app, not physical comics, it is confirmed that mono had actually watched six be captured by the hunter, and so made a decision to save her from the beast! they also tell you a little bit about mono's life before ln2, though it is very ambiguous"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-27,this was a very thorough and detailed timeline i enjoyed it very much ty!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-20,dont forget about her shadow selfsoul? watching her when she eats
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-02,"i think six's fantasy is a main character our be stronger one. and i think the franchise is a metaphor to grow up and become a soulless adult. you know, those small temptations of being selfish and use people to get what you want at anycost. no love, no care, no friendship, no campanionship... just use. survive. and repet. and when six throw momo in that pit, she was geting rib of all her weakness. we saw that six cared about momo and he became her weakness, but little nightmares's world doesn't forgave weakness. you have to be heartless to survive there."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,everyone else we should work together and help everyone! six mmm living food!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,lol 430 the kid saying jesus christ
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,awesome lore video! i can't wait to see an extended lore version after little nightmares iii comes out next year! the trailer looked awesome!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-06,429 not the jesus christ!in the background
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-12,817 that was really sudden and somehow it managed to get a laugh out of me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-27,great video honestly! i really enjoyed every single second of it. i hope you keep up this great effort
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-18,i wouldn't call six getting the best ending. her hunger is constantly increasing.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-05,spirited away...was the main inspiration for this game
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-08,"1413 players what the fu six mmm, that was scrumdiddlyumptious."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-16,"bro as a fan of little nightmare, this channel is soo underrated"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-12,these games are literally an emotional rollercoaster
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-22,six needs to learn some morals
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-10,"all this crazy stuff with the plot twists and unhinged behavior makes me think six must be a legitimate sociopath. how else could she so easily and comfortably resort to cannibalism while having other options, and betray mono to a horrible fate, after everything her and mono went through together, and all the times mono tried to save her? no loyalty to those most loyal to her, and ignoring any obvious truths in favor of a limited and narcissistic view of events. yeah, she has no empathy, totally self absorbed, and i don't feel bad for her growing hunger and emptiness. she deserves it, and she'll either realize that after it's too late, or she really has no heart and she'll never realize it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-10,"yeah idk if its true but the biggest theory of the original game was six becoming the lady in the end so no she didnt escape with cool powers, the 2 main game characters become the final boss in the end"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-02,cory was too stunned to speak
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-29,since its been confirmed by bandai that mono and six will return in little nightmares. now idk what theyll do with mono since i thought he was supposed to be in a time loop but considering six survives and has powers i imagine she might become the main antagonist of little nightmares 3
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-16,my favorite thing is how shocked everyone was when six dropped mono it never fails to make me giggle
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-15,"six reminds me of the unstable wolf, which is a story in bhuddism about a wolf that is trapped on this rock because it has flooded and there is now way to get any food. he is worried about keeping a sabbath feast to stay holy and sakka the king of gods sees this and wants to test the wolf. sakka turns into a goat and stands next to the wolf wondering if the wold will recognizethat its their god or try to kill them, the wolf immediately tries to kill sakka. sakka turns back into his god form and i think scolds the wolf saying in their own way you say how your holy and want to keep a sabbath feast, but here you are trying to kill your own god. here six is eating seven without realizing that its seven, because he had took form of the gnome thingy. because she was hungry."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-03,i am so excited for the new version of this that is coming out. like i know its not going to be conncected to these but its going to actually have a coherent story
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-04,i love how she refuses to eat the sausage because it's made of humans and then just eats literally everyone else kinda messed up
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-02,"for me six is the very a example of people to leave alone after giving a helping hand because you will either be betrayed or consumed by her, literally"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"six  ew, don't give me that human flesh sausage, i would rather eat the little gremlins that help me rather than the things trying to kill me every step of the way."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-23,"thank you for this video, i thought i knew the rundown of this game but you explained things i didn't even realize"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-15,when i was playing the the dlc i saw that the lady and thought she was brushing but when i took a closer look she was holding a baby doll
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-08,omg thank you for using the song storage from vln the song is so under appreciated but its one of my faves out of the whole series. i clicked the video and was like hey i know that song!' xd
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-21,"maybe after escaping the maw, six went to rescue mono from his loop."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-24,"amazing work, didnt know the series at all. very nightmare bf xmas  coraline vibes, obviously."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-23,can't wait to see more videos in the future
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-14,"i think there's a darkness left in six after being changed into a monster but i also think there's still goodness and her reasoning for dropping mono was that she figured out he was thin man and let go thinking that would make it so he never become him. little did she know that her doing that was the reason he became thin man and why he targeted her in the first place as a form of payback. he likely would have never come to be if she saved him, ultimately being responsible for it all, including her darkness."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-01,"507 six was cold, they were in an abandoned hospital while it was pouring rain outside, she was cold, she needed worth and got some f4om the incinerator"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-13,"mono wasn't really stuck in a time loop, he was just doomed to be destroyed by a pastyounger version of himself."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,when the teacher was in the vents with her long neck mono said 'jesus crist'
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-02,best story line... they made a prequel to show the developing character of six. hope to see more of this in the future
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-05,tarsier studios we have created a really unique and interesting franchise that everyone obsesses over. let's abandon it!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-01,"genuinely liked this man, great work with the videos"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-04,little nightmares is literally a masterpiece!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,thank you so much for including that reaction compilation lol.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-18,i wonder where little nightmares 3 will go also like you said little nightmares and the first dlc do take place because in the dlc you can see six going through the maw aswell as when six is caged and escapes you actually see the runaway kid getting dragged hes he got dragged
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-17,this is the most popular this guy has ever made your channel is also very underrated i hope this channel grow
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,1530 bro how is eating a live human fairer than eating piece of a dead human
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-12,"when six is first taken by the thin man she reaches out to mono while he cowers and does nothing, i always saw the ending of ln2 as her getting her revenge. in regards to 945"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-21,honestly has me so excited for 3
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-26,i think six is traumatized because the girl in the yellow coat fell and when six grabbed mono's hand and maybe she triggered ptsd.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-23,i love little nightmare videos and its nice to see someone making them
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,when six was taken by the thin man part of her caring and passion the glitchy version of her so the glitchy six left she had no use for it due to already betraying mono so the glitchy six showed her the poster to show what she get to fill the void inside of her then she began to eat more bigger and alive things to fill the gap thats left inside of her since she had lost her sense of mercy.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,"i don't know if this is a stupid thought but i feel like this game was somewhat inspired by caroline. if i'm right... that's pretty cool. if not, well still cool. also i know this'll sound ridiculous, but mono is likely for monotone, the thing that is black and white meaning he's connected to the tv and the other characters that was outside of him was actually just his other selves, the ones that failed... meaning that the thin man has likely have convinced six to do that to save himself, even if temporary to maintain the chaotic cycle where the world can't get out of. six is likely the one, who is the entity to all worlds, the shadow of the darkness... meaning that the glitch is the follower of antichirst making six look like she is still alive.... well that's just a hypothesis that may or may not make sence... and i'm pretty sure not much people are gonna read this. and from what the creator said, it seems that mono is trapped in the fantasy. but its cool that they made it up to debate. and if you think about it, all the two main characters of the stories are just living their fantasy time by time... but that's just my crazy thought... another thought is that this whole game is a freakish cycle of the two person's causing destruction... once attempting to escape from such things... the world gets chaotic..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-12,i want to play the game. both parts. it was such a good explained video and it got me.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-13,"welp, get ready for little nightmares 3 then"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-23,"i think that yes, because mono destroyed six's music box he was then dropped by her at the end, and in addition i believe when he grew up, he as the thin man took six and gave her back the music box to undo his past destroying of it, and therefore save their friendship, and that's also why he tries to takekill his younger self, to stop this happening. however, six getting a good look at his face and seeing the resemblance is also a valid argument for dropping her..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-10,"this story still dosent explain what this world is, is it another dimension or a post apocalyptic world?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-19,bro with the mano betrayal coryxkenshins reaction is priceless
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-12,"still. how did the world of the game get to that situation. people eating humans, phantom cities and people obsessed with tvs and with their jobs. like the doctor and the teacher."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-30,damn bro really nice video

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-02,"yeah dude, little nightmares will never have a happy ending... except her."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-02,mono deserved a better ending like escaping with six
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-05-27,that's so freaky how mono is stuck in a loop because we are playing as em

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-12,runaway kid had the saddest he was kind and yet got eaten by her
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-04-08,imagine having to do all that hard work to survive and make quick decisions so a monster that lives in a sewer doesnt kill you just to get eaten in the end

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-02,"something i always realized is, everytime a character dies in the game, they always wake up like they were in a dream, or a nightmare"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-27,"raincoat girl's ending was just sad, she was literally the only one trusted by six with her life that being said everyone's ending is horrifying, even the surviving person six dosen't seem to get a happy ending with her hunger issues"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-12-18,"yes six escaped but what she had to do to accomplish that...she to accept her dark side, her true side..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-11,"explanation six escapes through television after betraying mono, but his soulpart is separated and causes him to suffer from extreme hunger taken from secret ending mono betrayed by six before reaching the ending, the reason for being betrayed is that six was angry because his music box was destroyed by mono with an axe mono's face is the same as thin man spoon girl caught by the doctor, the reason was because she was made tired by the doctor by giving him a small spoon to dig the ground to another room, so his energy was drained, plus she had a nonstopnosebleed. the runaway kid caught by the lady and turned into a nome, then eaten by six, because six's instincts controlled his mind to eat the runaway kid who had turned into a nome. raincoat girl fell from the nest cliff because of the pretender the last boss of very little nightmare and was touched by the pretender's hand. i have a theory that the pretenders have the ability to turn objects into steam. taken from the game very little nightmare scarf kid kidnapped and made into a puppet by a craftsman in an attempt to escape. taken from the game very little nightmare sorry if it's too long"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-04-30,six is actually stuck in a loop too like mono. six will become the new lady of the maw and will soon make a little version of herself using her powers to be sent off to the hunters cabin so little her could relieve older six of her burden duty as the lady of the maw. basically mono and six help repeat the loop.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-29,"six had no good intentions, she only used mono to get to the maw for her hunger. i've learned that she is more heartless than what i thought"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-04,"guys if you wondering what happens to six after monos loop, the secret ending has six thrown out the tv and glitch six , not dark six. is the death of her, wich is sixs tummy growled and no food was near, this may lead to her end, did she lost???"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-20,the new characters looks so cute me realizing that little nightmares has no good ending
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-26,"i think that raincoat girl died from falling onto the water or getting vaporized by the pretender, because no one could survive that huge fall"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-22,fun fact six is the lady she's in the same loop like mono
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-09,why do i just love this art?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-10,mono deserved so much better his story is the saddest to me due to him helping six despite her tragic beginning he tried and she betrayed him
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-23,"bro i really hope in the next game they show six as escaping from the maw, and not becoming the heir to it"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-17,"actually there is a theory that says that six actually never got to escape from the maw and she grew up to be the lady in kimono, only to get killed by herself in future, making her stuck in a time loop too"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-11-24,"i have a theory about rcg and it might be crazy. reina rcg is actually the ladys daughter and she was sent to the nest to become a new governess of the maw, she didnt die at the end but she somehow ended up on the maw, found a flashlight, lost flashlight to rk, and got turned into a nome on her journey to destroy the lady. in the little nightmares dlc in the room of nomes with their special shadows, you can see one of the nomes has a shadow that looks just like flashlight girl"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-22,"i think spoon girl actually survived. look at the girl in the third game. i think it's low? one is low the other is alone but i forgot which lmao she has pigtails too, and spoon girl has constant nosebleeds, and the lower face of low? is covered by the neck of her coat, perhaps to stop the mess from bleeding. edit i mistook low for alone. knew it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-13,i have a theory!!!!!! the first game is tomelined after the second. as we see in the second thats when she gets her raincoat and she doesnt seem to have her powers yet. in the first she wears the raincoat from the start to finish and gets powers at the end. reply if you think my theory is right
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-30,"if you think about it. six is also stuck in a loop with mono, since shes the one who triggers thin man, hence causing him to loop the timeline over and over, means that six needs to be in the loop in order for it to continue. so yes, six didnt exactly escape, but is also in a time loop."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"fun fact 6 dropped. mono cause she sensed his dark presence. she dropped him into the abyss, not knowing it would create a time loop."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-03-15,when you realize the thin mono was trying to save you from six dropping u.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-03,"the runaway kid seven deserved better tbh. he was so nice and helped out nomes, had a hard life, and when he was a nome instead of caring about himself,he gave six the sausage in hope of saving her from starvation. then she ate him. its honestly really sad, plus he had a very good and sweet vibe to him. he deserves to be with the other nomes and be happy too  i cried so, so hard when he died."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-23,omg they all look so freaking cute and adorable!!!!!!!!

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-04-22,six is on her can't stop girl bossing arc.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-05,"guys perhaps six is also trapped in a time loop, first we never saw her actually leave but also when six beats the lady, in the ladys room there is a picture of a girl in a yellow raincoat that it literally identical to six, so i think that six grew up into the lady, which means she is also in a time loop with mono. kids who survive the maw get into a time loop and turn into monsters."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-06,we could only imagine mono with a better ending. such as probably breaking the loop to live freely.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-04-19,"six may have escaped, but it came with a cost, her innocence."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-12-27,why six always escaping  like  she eated kid like she was a monster and hanibal and why she is alive!? i know that mono is a thin man but he is good
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-02,six is actually in a loop too... she needs the souls of guests and therefore she became the lady and now runs maw edit she needs the souls cuz thin man took her shadow

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-11,"ohhh yes, please play little nightmares 2 i wanna see you play that too"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-07,"i just discovered, the thin man is actually mono from the future trying to tell past six and mono of the dangers ahead. six and mono i guess were scared of the thin man and ran away only for six being the only one that escapes, and mon9 being stuck in the loop forever. its really a sad story and i cant wait for little nightmares 3 to come out so that we can find out what happens."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-09,"yeah, mono deserves to have a better ending bro. had to go through like five different islands just to get stuck in a loop. if theres a little nightmares for mono has to have a good ending bro. he deserves to have a good ending. he really did so much just get stuck in the loop."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-02,"i know many people say, only six got a happy end, but not if you ask me. during little nightmares she completely lost her soul. at first she ate bread and meat, but then she had to eat other living things in order to survive a rat, a nome the runaway kid and the geisha. in the end she may survive, but what it costed her was too high same with mono, he got stuck in a loop  is alive, but not happy"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-23,"poor mono, he deserved better he helped almost all of the children"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-01-12,"this is easily one of my favorite games of all time. i remember a year ago when this game came out and i was so excited because i remember having such a thrilling adventure in the first game. when i heard that tarsier isnt going to be making more ln games, my heart dropped. i still have a tiny bit of hope for a third, even thought its unlikely. thank you tarsier and thank you bandai namco for an experience ill never forget"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-26,you can clearly see at 132 mono's face . he never wanted to six taken away . that's why he goes to signal tower to save six

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-03-26,"no matter how big the team is, it's still hard to believe someone sat down and modelled every single insignificant little asset you see in this game."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-08,020 that part scared me when i first saw this trailer

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-13,this is a masterpiece
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-14,thank you bandai  tarsier for this masterpiece!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-12,i cannot believe it has already been 2 years...where does the time go...
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-29,"whenever i hear that one song at the start, it feels nostalgic for me for some reason and makes me feel like crying"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-31,i doubt the 3rd little nightmares would be able to be as good as the perfectness of this one
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-25,"here's a dlc concept,in the dlc you would play as uno.in the start you would start the game in what seems like a postal office,this is where the postman would come into place.uno would have to dodge incoming letters from the postman to escape,only to have an unexpected team up with a corrupted soul with the code name night together you would have to run across bridges and type ropes to meet face to face with tall man.almost in an attempt to escape your friend night gets sucked into the power of tall man.in the end of the dlc you end up to finding a school.only to enter into your demise.getting turned into frog in the end to only be played with in the school part of the main story"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-09,"bandai, youre probably not going to see this but little nightmares holds a special place in my heart and the atmosphere and animation in these games is beautiful. i can tell your team have been working their asses off so if you can, tell them i said well done"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-08-01,"after finishing both games, it is clear to me thin man needs to stop living in the past and catch her ass outside the maw on game 3!!! i hope y'all see this"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,use code pointless for 10 off gamersupps  httpsgamersupps.ggpointless
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"the chair underneath the man, who hanged himself at the beginning, is kind of interesting. not only is the chair still standing, even though using this method of suicide, would've resulted in it being kicked over. but it's also way too far down to have been used as a ledge to step into the noose. what this tells you is that the chair had nothing to do with the death of this man, and might've been placed there by someone else."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"actually the reason old times are full of so many morbid folk tales, is exactly because the times were so hard. they are meant as cautionary tales to keep children from entering danger. don't go near the rushing river where you could fall and drown, because an old lady will pull you in. don't go into the forest where you could get lost and killed by an animal, because the trolls will catch and eat you. the simplicity of the stories, implying an intelligent force, is easier to understand as dangerous, rather than the regular, mundane dangers of life. the colorful tales also help children remember the lessons learned, and the vivid imagination of the children ensures that the beast they need to avoid is sufficiently frightening, to keep them at bay."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"finding out the gnome six eats is the runaway kid from the dlc made me actually sob. you do so much for him to help him escape, and he unlike six is made to be much more likable. the story intentionally juxtaposes six's ruthless survival instincts with runaway kid's compassion. when i played as six, i was less fueled by wanting her to survive and more by my own burning curiosity to learn about the world she lives in. with the runaway kid, however, i wanted him to live so bad. it just goes to show how in this series, kindness is a weakness edit the fact this comment thread is still active nearly a full year later, y'all are wilding"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-25,"to me the tall man being mono implies that he tried to get his friend back, if he wanted to save himself from becoming the tall man, he could either have left them alone or killed her, instead he goes to pick her up and give her a toy to pacify her, ultimately he is a good person and just wanted his only friend back."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,the fact that the gnomes have child shaped shadows in the furnace safe room is such a cool detail!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,the teacher may be playing on fears of snakes... counterpoint have you considered that the teacher may be playing on fears of people with 100 foot long necks?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-29,"i like how six eating the rat is immediately contrasted by the kitchen, to me that shows how she just works off her base instincts and most of the time doesn't even think about trying to find another solution to her problems, just like how she abandons the children and mono, it shows how the only person that matters in her mind is her, making her almost like an animal."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"i think another reason six may've dropped mono is the fact that you're fresh off destroying her source of comfort, one that she willing to share with you, and let you get close to, never thought about all the times mono had failed to save her before though"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-25,"the fact that the designer went idk how anyone could ever think a child trying to escape and an adult trying to keep the child trapped represents a motherdaughter relationship shows he had a pretty good, insular home life."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,"i find the scene where six ate the gnome so interesting coz i assumed that six didn't know that the gnomes were actually children but she knew that all the meat were made out of people or children, so now i wonder whether six ate the gnome because she thought that they weren't the same species as her and knowing that the sausage were made out of children or she ate the gnome with malicious intent"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,i love the description of the patients in the hospital. people who grew so bored of life that they participated in the doctor's experiments just to feel something.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"for the last boss battle against the masked lady, my theory is that six is using the mirror to exorcise her. in shinto belief, small shrined hand held mirrors considering the mirror is hidden behind a locked door or sorts, it could be considered the masked woman's personal shrine can be used to exorcise evil spirits by 'reflecting them away', and break when their purpose has been achieved. so, six wasn't fighting the masked woman but whatever evil power was residing inside her, pushing it out of the masked woman and, ultimately, consumining it to be it's next host for... well, aid whatever twisted ideas six might have."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-12,how people could see this as a motherdaughter relationship i don't know. nobody said it had to be a healthy relationship.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-24,"because mono is the thin man, it's my personal theory that six is in a time loop of her own, and that she, like mono, is the lady. forever trapped in a cycle of killing her future self and becoming the thing she's trying to escape. just like mono."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-27,"sitting cheek to cheek, shitting with your bro is wild"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"i think that's the message. everyone fights their dark side, their monsters inside, but once you give in give up, you become that monster. in this game series literally. 6 becomes hunger incarnate, the boy from the second game becomes the tall man he feared. the bizarre thing is that the boy to become the tall man, must first beat his fear of him in the first place. the true nightmare is that you become what you fear the most."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"i remember my first play through of little nightmares 2. the twist was so good and made me actually be invested in some confusing plot. everything about it is perfect janky controls, medium levelled puzzles and a dark creepy ass atmosphere to get me invested in."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"little nightmares is truely one of the most unique horror games out there. wish more horror games took the direction this game takes, especially in art style"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-29,"11928 no more edging, hes going full bust brilliant"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-07,the little nightmares franchise captures what i fear most..... short people the triple k starvation bad chefs fat people evil grandma's turning racist cannibalism women people from texas school teachers doctors me from the future but evil manmade horrors getting dumped
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"six might be small due to malnourishment, she gets hungry a lot during the game and at some point some reaches one of the earliest stages of starvation in wich hunger makes you eat anything that your brain recognizes as food regardless of it's quality, taste or origin and eats a gnome alive, six might be older and been on the maw longer than most of the kids you see in game but lack of available food, stress and fatigue might've hurt her development"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,"i'm surprised you didn't mention how at the hospital, you can come across a room where the wall is adorned with several deformed masks that resemble the faces of the various monsters you come across throughout the series. this could mean that nearly every enemy you encounter, from the janitor to the doctor, are actually wearing poorlymade masks in an attempt to appear human, making you wonder what they truly look like..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,seeing the gnomes shadows in the runaway kid story was such a good hint that these gnomes were children. you don't see their pointy hats. i loved those wee guys. i'm still butt hurt that the first little nightmares has no platinum. one of the trophies is to run through the game in under an hour with no deaths. it's so difficult. just from a platforming perspective. i would try speedily running and just catch a corner wrong and fall. back to the start.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-20,i think the case with the masked lady is that she isnt really ugly but mainly she has been cursed that any reflections shows her real beauty and age. a self reflection of her own action in a literal reflection.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-27,im actually blown away that the developer cant imagine a controlling motherdaughter relationship being a stories theme. has he never heard of rapunzel?!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"when little nightmares 3 comes out it's very possible we'll see mono again as the thin man. i also love his name mono, it tells you all along that he is the thin man. mono is a setting on a tv and whenever we see the door in little nightmares 2 the sounds are muffled just like putting your tv in mono."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"i think the part that unsettles me the most about the twin chefs is the music that plays whenever they spot you. in any other context, the sound of a tuba or trombone playing in time with the steps of a large, overweight figure would solely be used for comedic effect. yet i vaguely recall having my own nightmares of being stalked by a giant, dopey creature who wants to catch andor eat me, all while similar goofy music would play, telling me to get away. i grew up watching shows like barney or sesame street, so i wasnt necessarily afraid of fullbody suits. what scared me back then was the idea of confronting something that would normally be considered friendly or silly, but instead turns out to be deeply sinister which may partially explain why ive grown to have a soft spot for mascot horror as an adult."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"if you liked these games you should try bramblethe mountain king, it's a game where you play as a little boy who has to try to save his sister and encounters various nightmarish scandinavian fairy tale creatures"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-21,i've noticed a recurring theme in ln2 of the mimicry of life. the hunter creates and poses taxidermied people in a home setting. the teacher lectures porcelain children in a school setting. the doctor creates and monitors mannequin patients in a hospital setting. the only real people are those seemingly responsible for the false humans as well as the masses of faceless nobodies glued to their tvs. i wonder if this is supposed to tiein to the message the game might be trying to portray about media consumption.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-09,"503  six isnt incapable of showing emotion, shes just selective about it also six  chucks nome"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"nah purposefully letting someone go who you already have saved is definitely evil. everytime mono let six down you could objectively argue it was outside of his ability to save her, six let him down while in full control of the situation."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"the child wants to escape and the adult wants to keep the child trapped forever. how people see that as a motherdaughter relationship, i just don't know. so strange to hear something like this from the creator of darkthemed horror game... there is one story that i heard and will never forget... mother just ditched her little baby in the forest where gnats just sucked that little girl dry. fing gnats. heck, we even have some extremely creepy and dark songs about parents that try to murder their children for various dumb reasons. imo the cruelty of some human beings are pretty much like abyss."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"i love the hidden meanings in little nightmare games, and while the characters never speak they have interesting personalities, they are so simple and the silence and overloud sound designs make the game more horrific. the meaning of six extreme hunger that seems to kill her shows how much she must've been starved, and mono who hides his face behind a bag shows his fear of being judged."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-27,i m still mad at six. the way she betrayed mono still gets me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-22,the whole of the first game reminds me of the circle of gluttony. its a hellish design full of excess.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"4406 i think that the game being made by swedes, the old hag resembles ncken nkki, nicor, nkk, nkken, nixie. in nordic folklore ncken is usually potrayed slender woman or man with long damp hair, who tries to lure people into water, and then drown them. the tale is mainly used as a warning for children not to go near bodies of water. i remember my parents telling me not ot go near a murky pond that was near my home as a child, because nkki lived there. after that i had nightmares of nkki pulling me uinto that pond..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"i just love the horror of the signal tower, the closest thing to a god we have saw until this point. in case you're interested there are short comics expanding the world, introducing other monsters like an evil mirror and a storm creature."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,"i think if you read the playstation blog qa, it's pretty clear that many of their answers are deliberately vague or even sarcastic. i particularly like this one sure. they escaped the maw and sailed off into the sunset on a 32foot yacht called the endeavour, where they sipped champagne and played shuffleboard in their pajamas. then they woke up. they clearly don't want to provide concrete answers about their work's meaning, and the answer about the relationship between the lady and six should be read in that context."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-28,if you go to the scene with the hung man at 259 and compare it with the scene of mono becoming the thin man 13825 you can see that the chair he sits on is the same one under the man hanging. the characters also have the same lower body design with a small gap between the pants and the shoes.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-23,"820 on the other hand, her growth could very well be stunted due to malnutrition, as we know all of her goals are based around food."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,love that mono's story ends on a monotone
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-26,i love how 2 shows six saving mono more than once on long jumps because she wants him to survive. but when shes taken she recognizes mono as the tall man and that leads to her dropping him.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-26,"i think this series is about the cycle of abuse, either a child becoming their abusers in order to survive and escape their suffering, or because the world around them rips away every other choice until being a monster is the only path left"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-18,the fact that the gnomes at 4841 have shadows in the shape of children is a nice hint at foreshadowing
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-25,honestly these games gives me how this is a story of a girl whos been burden by trauma bevane the toxic thing she didnt want to become the loss of innocence
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-30,"no more edging, he's going full bust comedic gold"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-01,"the only videogame series that has made me cry a lot and made depressed, first i had this weird feeling when six ate the gnome when the gnome was already offering her food made me disgusted, then playing the dlc and knowing that the gnome was the run away kid made me cry and being sensitive for 3 days like if someone near to me has passed away. then in ln2 seeing how six let go mono to become the thin man made me sad as well"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-28,"it makes so much sense that six doesnt react to the hanging man or other dangers by crying or screaming, because in the comics shes referred to the child that has seen things they shouldnt or something like that"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,this game was such an atmospheric experience.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,little nightmares is proof indie game industry needs to be protected at all cost
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"gotta give a massive clap and round of love to the composer, tobias lilja. one of the few composers who can perfectly encapsulate  horror  solitude  hope all in a single track. even if the bonus tracks for ln2 were a lot more experimental same for the upcoming ln3. prison waltz, the lady circles and room with a view are the perfect examples."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-04,the masked ladies hum is forever stuck in my head since playing for the first time and now i constantly hum along with her
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,theres another little nightmares game called very little nightmares that gives a bit more back story to six. i also think it says a lot about six as a character that she constantly pushes mono to go first into danger and the fact the gnome only interacts with mono in the dlc makes me think its supposed to be the spirit of rk somewhat warning mono
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,"12020 i mean, when i played it i found the lighthouse strategy to be effective and simple on my first attempt."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-25,"i don't know if it was mentioned, but little nightmares 3 isn't actually being made by tarsier studios. or at least the same devs who made the first game. it's being made by supermassive games from what i found, also known for making until dawn. whether that's a good or bad thing depends on how you see it, but the fact that the giant baby monster in the trailer is actually concept art from the previous games, at least shows they're making the effort to try and honour the series."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-20,i did not expect to be so emotionally invested in these stories. they're just beautiful and haunting.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-25,"sad that mono does the leap of faith in two significant times with six. the first time when you've just met, then the last time after you've been through it all together and she's grown more callus and cold."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-24,isnt it interesting how the runaway kid tries to help the gnomes and anyone he can but gets killed in the process. while six who never gives it much thought and thinks more selfishly is the one who lived and gains power. in this twisted world it makes sense that being good gets you killed while being evil is the good thing.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,a totallypointlesstv video for an early christmas present is amazing
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,that fuse was like nah i'ma do my own thing.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-17,"930 something i like about this scene is how careful roger walks around and how he quietly closes the door so he won't wake the children. he also doesn't kill six when caught. he shows some level of compassion towards the children, even if it's just a little, and he has no problem with locking them in cages and sending them to the kitchen. i like this type of character design. you can learn so much about a character by how they act and what they do."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-25,"to add to six being shaped by the world around her  there's actually a mobile game, very little nightmares, where you play as the original owner of the yellow raincoat. the girl in the raincoat helps six, who seemingly helps her fend off the antagonist in return  only for the villain to not be dead, and to die in a mutual kill with the protagonist. having tried to help another and failed, it makes sense that six stops trying to save anyone but herself. in addition, when commenting on six dropping mono, the official twitter account said extracting someone from a fantasy can be deeply upsetting for everyone involved. she was happy and safe with her music box as a monster, but mono took it upon himself to save her, taking that escapism away from her. her decision to drop him could have easily been out of spite  he took away her comfort in the world because he didn't want to be alone."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,this game was soo creepy it's just makes u feel soo unease and even uncertain at times it also was one of the best games for me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-30,"i think you got some things wrong, like when mono left six getting crushed under the building only for him to coma back is not six feeling betrayed, but more like oh you actually came back for me instead of leaving me the second time we can see her reaching out for him instead of giving up or not even trying to reach out for monos knowing he will betray her, now when she is a monster she is not aggressive towards us until we destroy her toy, i mean she is showing us what makes her vulnerable and when he try something she doesnt crush us just push us away, i think that later on she realizes that even those that care for her can hurt her intensively thats why she decided to let mono go, he is a variable that can and will hurt her according to her"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-12,"the first chase with janitor when he's sending the children down to the kitchen is always scary, because once he hears you, he won't stop looking for you, and aside from the occasional rats, he's supposed to be the only one in there. so if something or someone makes the floorboards creak, he knows something isn't right and a child as escaped."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-24,"1353 there's also the detail that none of the kids are making any attempt at...anything, they're just sitting quietly, they've fully lost hope"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-27,"little nightmares is a series that i cant find the words to describe my love for. it gives me this warm feeling in my chest, the music, atmosphere, design, its all so beautiful. even though no one says a word, mono and six have become such iconic characters in my eyes, especially mono. the twist ending made me so sad and desperate for a way to save him and a third game. im so happy and ecstatic that we are actually getting little nightmares 3. during the hospital i was hoping you would show this video from tiktok i saw, where a players strategy was to just spin mono around while moving forward like a tornado xd. i have a theory and a few ideas for the lore behind the world of little nightmares, the symbolism of eyes everywhere and that nasty flesh creature when the six gets freed. the eyes could be representing this lovecraftian thing, consuming everything through the tv signal. but now six after the maw also has this power to absorb things, which made me think, what if she goes back with this new power and tries to absorb the eyeball creature?? maybe that was her goal all along?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"yes! i never thought you'd cover this series. i love the themes of hunger in the first game, and the second game being centered around identity and control."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"little nightmares 2 was the first horror game that i played through completely, nor have seen any previous gameplay online, and i absolutely loved it. wish i could go into more games blind."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-02,"mono being in time loop maybe has to do with regret rather than a literal time loop. living in regrets not saving six to stop himself from becoming like what he is, always looping maybe in one of those fantasies his past self would actually save six instead of being a coward. living in regret and never accepted the truth made who he is... thin man. though i don't know what his power suppose to mean."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-28,"12723 well yes that also the signal tower adds bodies to it's ever growing mass, but that flesh in the scene specifically is the signal tower itself"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"12520 i think this what allowed mono to reach the door this time, when six stared at him it felt like she was feeling betrayed. so when mono walked into the room she stoped by the door and you can see how distant she's trying to be in the next events i'm not sure if that's the case but i think it's a nice detail"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-01,"even though im very late, i wanted to point out that if you get caught by the thin man, he doesnt hurtkill you, unlike other deaths, he just stares which proves your point of thin man trying to save his younger self!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,"i adore every ln game so far, even the mobile game. cool concepts and great executions! oh, and the tv jingle in the second game is such a bop"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-12,"can i just mention the fact that your voice is soooooooo perfect, not too slow, not too fast, perfect enunciation. it makes it so much easier to just listen to a 1hr analysis without me feeling bored or needing to take a break"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-18,502 six isn't incapable of showing emotions. she's just selective about it. yeets gnome you had me dying
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-08,"i interpret the mirror thing differently, not a continuity error but a deliberate decision. body dysmorphia is a very strange thing to experience, it really warps your perception of yourself, i think the lady can look at her reflection but only when she can control the situation, hence why all the mirrors are cracked, if she can distort her reflection then she isnt truly seeing it, and so when shes looking at herself in the full length mirror, its an intentionally private moment, in darkness, where she assumes she is alone, and therefore can take a moment to face her reflection and dwell at her own appearance, she looks at herself with a mournful gaze, as if she is sad that her beauty is long gone, and whether it is truly gone and she has aged, or its something shes seeing, a dysmorphia that contorts her perception of herself so that all she sees is what she believes as ugly. so when six uses the mirror to fight her off, my interpretation is that its the lack of control, being made to view her reflection unwarrantedly, not being able to pose herself in a way that makes her feel is more flattering, not being able to control the angle, the expression on her face, and therefore, the image she sees, an image already misshapen and distorted by her dysmorphia, being all the more worse to look at as that tiny ounce of control she has over her appearance is being taken away, and used against her, her ultimate weakness becoming her end."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-22,just the artstyle and animations alone is insanely amazing and the fact no one ever talks makes it so much better tho the game can be quite clunky and far from perfect it still will forever have a big place in my heart. my theory of the lady is that what we see in the mirror is what she actually looks like but har magic keeps her young so when she looks in a mirror she sees her true self kinda like the story of the immortal man with a painting that ages instead of him as long as he doesn't look at it he will never age. forget the name to me it feels the wall of flesh is a greater entity if not meant to be symbolic seems the main villain as it seems to control the thin man in some way or use him rather as the signal as the sequal seems very eldrich in nature. man can't wait to get my hands on the 3rd game and i really do hope it turns out good as a new company is taking over aswell as with coop i doubt we will get much answers on the world as a whole but hey we can always hope.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-30,"some of the children were also her size, i think it has to do with the amount of food they're given"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-28,"258 the hanging man has always fascinated me just because of how little sense this scene makes. his sheer length is one thing, but it's the fact that he's hanging above the still standing chair that really disturbs me. he clearly hung himself, but there's no way he could've jumped off the chair below him. it makes no sense and that's what makes this scene even more scary"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-01,"one of my favorite things about little nightmares is the way the monsters of this world have very normalinnocent sounding nameslabels. you wouldn't think the chefs, teacher, doctor, janitor, bullies, lady would sound outlandish or scary. it's just so simple but very ominous in this type of atmosphere."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,little nightmares 2's hospital level is the scariest level i've ever played. i will never forget those mannequins
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,the amount of times i rage quitted on the hospital part when trying to escape the mannequins! eventually learned to just spin around really really fast and move at the same time worked a treat
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-23,little nightmares 2 ends with a paradox where six leaving the thin man behind inevitable creates the thin man anyway. calling it now the third game will end with both protagonists escaping on a ship the same ship that you here at the end of the first game.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-24,"i love you, dude. in a healthy, nonparasocial way lol. youre my favorite creator tbh and it was a joy to see this upload for christmas. another one to add to the sleep playlist for regular rewatching. i have been avoiding gamer supps because im afraid itll make my heart explode and my liver fail, but for you, i might just go for it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-03,i loved both games the atmosphere and design is really cool. its one of the only games where i turned my music off while playing
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-08,"regarding the third game, tarsier has no involvement, unfortunately. after the second game, they decided to move on to other projects, feeling theyd told the story they wanted to with the first two games. bandai namco, on the other hand, still has the rights to the ip, so have handed over developing privileges to another studio. im cautiously optimistic that it could still be a good sequel. that being said, it will be a truly momentous task to not only recreate, but add to the mythology of the twisted, unique world tarsier created."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-09,"4631 omg, thank you i knew i wasnt the only one who thought of this! you know whats funny i got obsessed with little nightmares and pikmin both at the same time this year like literally right now and thats the reason why i thought of that."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-27,the comics say that mirrors are evil and the longarm is a kid who surrendered to the mirror. the mirror 6 found shows the face without morphing. the lady had to see her face but truth hitting a lost person hits harder than a sledgehammer.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-30,i literally choked when six lets go. i felt that betrayal so deeply for a video game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,the reason he holds his hand up is actually because he is mono and so mimics his movements. holding his hand out like that could also be a foreshadowing that they try and stop each other for different reasons

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,i really think the solution was just to convince six to never let him go
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,well he wasnt being very polite about the whole grabbing issue. he must know mono doesnt like being grabbed by large people.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-30,i cant get it over that mono trap in his own loop. hes just a boy

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-27,"if mono and six could have found a way to develop a deeper trust and cooperation, perhaps avoiding the betrayal in the signal tower mono's tranformation and this cycle could have been disrupted. six's survival instinct ultimately leads her to abandon mono. mono is stuck in a loop because of the signal tower, manipulates realuty and controls the minds of the citizens.it's power twists space, time and perception, creating a distorted world that constantly loops. sixs betrayal may represent the breaking of mono's innocence and trust, and it could serve as the beginning of his tranformation into the thin man..his trauma becomes part of the tower's endless cycle, locking him in a pattern where he must experience betrayal, isolation and horror repeatedly."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,the least suicidal child
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-01,nightmares lore is so good
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-05,"why does mono always fall behind six in the signal tower in every loop? it's strange how this cycle seems easy to break, but appear to not break anytime soon."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-15,i have never felt such seething hatred for a videogame character like i do for six. mono didn't deserve the endingloop he got.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-09,"people always say six is not worthy of mono. but his name mono says it all. monophobia means fear of being alone. if he kill six now, what do he have left? nothing. i pose a hypothesis like this mono has always loved six even when he became thin man. think about it, when thin man captures six all he needs to do is kill her to end this cycle. but he didn't do that, he just turned six into a monster and locked her up. but remember the room where six is locked. it's peaceful and has toys, including her music box. perhaps thin man is very angry with six and wants to punish her. but he didn't have the courage to hurt her too much. for one reason, six is too important to him, so important that even someone like thin man cannot forget it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-14,"thats why when you get caught by him he just stares at you, and diesnt actually cause any physical violence"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-29,"funny enough, the art cover foreshadows this. thin man is placed in front of the signal tower and the top of the tower makes it look like thin man has a bag on his head. it also foreshadows mono becoming the signal. super small detail i just noticed. that one picture proves that mono becomes the thin man and isgoing to be the signal."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-22,"mono's story makes me so sad, his name means 'one' or 'alone' and it sums up perfectly the nightmare of being alone he wants to escape yet repeats."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-03,but its a popular theory that the reason that six let go of mono is that she saw his face without the mask and recognized he was the thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-10,"that makes since to me. i once heard this theory that this cycle has been going on 6 times and that's why six is actually named six, because she is the sixth lady in the cycle"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-24,mono's just a little guy. even as the thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-18,"so, this whole time, in all of little nightmares, six was the true villain."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-25,only thing thin man had to do is talk to mono and explain to him instead of forcing him

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-01,"i definitely have a feeling that these two will appear in the 3rd game. probably not at protagonists, but we will figure out how mono's cycle ends and how six ends up in the maw alone"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-24,i think the reason the thin manfuture mono holds his hand at mono is because they are the same person and hes doing the same power hand movement
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-28,either this or the thin man is indeed trying to kill mono in order to end the cycle he'll never live to become the thin man again

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-18,"i thought thin man was doing wait they dont love me like i love you, wait they dont love me like i love you"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-15,"i think thats the cause of the paradox, the thin man so desperately tried to help mono, that he captures six, makes her loose part of her soulexplains her gruesomeness in ln1 and then she lets mono go, the thin man is so blind on destroying her before is too late, that he makes her the very monster that betrays him, the thin mans desperation is the cause of his own paradox"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-21,mono trying to help his younger self made sense but his younger self doesn't understand that he's actually trying to help him and ends up falling into the trap anyways its really sad ..
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,its like its over and over and over it will not stop mono didn't know thin man wants to help him
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-15,he pretty much could always take revenge using his powers but he still tries to stop mono and the time paradox
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-23,men this is sad
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-18,the plot twist of this game is so unpredictable
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,if they can actually speak maybe they can stop the cycle and that's why the creator of the game didn't put a voice in the character except for the falling animation sound and call miguel o'hara canon event !!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-14,"my first thought when i realized this was why doesn't the thin man just...kill six? then mono finds her dead, and doesn't have to waste too much time in the signal tower and get out of there."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-13,this all makes sense to me now. im literally crying.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-07,"i have a therory,the thin man is a peice of our soul,so when the next mono in the cycle,if he escapes,every thin man escaped as a part of mono,so most of him knows six betrayed him,so i want little nightmares 3 to be finding six to get revenge"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,"if mono didint become a thin man who will be guarding the tower? if mono escapes with six, the flesh monster will invade the city. since six knows he is the thin man she have no choice but to let got of him because she saw his face. and thin man took six to make her the guardian of the signal tower but she cant because mono will never stop until six was free. and mono didint stuck in the future but insted he was stuck in the past."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-12,he either tried to stop mono to end the loop or he actually wanted to end mono's life because he hated younger version of himself basically self hatred for trusting six. i just think the second one is a possibility.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-02,the story is deeper than we tought

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-27,this is like our parents trying to prepare us for the real world
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-26,maybe he also held his hand out because he is mimicking monos movements
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-22,"it's not just six letting go. all the thin man's from the past loops had different endings with six but all of them turns to betrayal because of what the thin man did and mono does to free it, you may have missed it but when six transformed back from being a monster. she looked upset at mono. before snapping back when the tower started to collapse"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-06,yoww the moment i realize  this makes alot of sense oh my god.. i love you bro.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-01,ive always wanted to play this game ive watched gameplay from both 1  2 and i absolutely love it all. cant wait to play

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,thank you for telling me this also i liked and subbed
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-17,"he also knows that he would go through many decades of total isolation and loneliness. i say he probably 60  70 years old as a thin man, and mono is like 7 or 8. that over 60 years in that room, a small chair, small room, little light, and sits there, minute after minute, day after day, year after year, until he is the thin man. even after all of that he always wants to help, he not the revenge type. he couldve kill six, ending the cycle. but i believe he has the biggest heart, more than anyone in the pale city."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-25,the biggest betrayal  still can't let go of this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-10,"it kind of makes sense when theres a different boss that model defeat theyre trying to hurt him, but the man he just grabs him and never hurt him. it kind of makes sense."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,that six aint got yo back
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,so basically six is the villain of the franchise
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-12,damn that makes sense now i feel bad for thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-07,"and be sure to check out the first part of the little nightmares 1 , where you'll see two very long legs hanging from somewhere , and it looks like he hanged him self because he couldn't escape the course."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-25,whats so sad is how mono will just be in a citcle of pain and death
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-11,"i always thought, while i was really angry at six for letting him go. i thought that after what happened to her, maybe thats why she let him go. maybe she got messed up from that. but still, wasnt very happy with the outcome."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,that is really sad if you think about it because mono is trapped in an endless loop. that's why the thin man tried to save him from sixs betrayal

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"an increasing note, i just noticed that the lady's kimono is crossed backwards, which is reserved for the dead."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,"i think the shape of sixs hoods opening also has a similar shape to the entrance to the maw, possibly foreshadowing that she is the rightful ruler of the ship."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"from the title, i thought the original game got remastered."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"i learned like 30 new things from this video. i had no idea about these foreshadowings and parallels. just wow, what an amazing game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,i like the depiction of three different states of hunger in the game 1. the hunger to survive  sixs hunger 2. the hunger for more  the guest hunger 3. the hunger for power  shadow sixs hunger it shows you how a simple word a simple problem can be seenexperienced in different ways.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,i'm so excited to see more little nightmares content. it feels like it's been so long since it's been relevant.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-19,"you already did this video this is exactly what i thought when i saw this for the past two days in my recommends, i genuinely thought it was resuggesting the video until i looked and saw it was from two days ago."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-19,"i interpret the shadow looming over the child in bed on the fourth channel on the tv is actually the ferryman, the thing sticking out not being a nose but the brim of his hat. most likely this is a foreshadowing of how it's revealed that the ferryman takes children away to the nowhere through the dreams of children in the podcast, and this kid is just another one of his victims."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,"i don't know why but very few people seem to mention that ln takes a lot of inspiration from the city of lost children and delicatessen by j.p jeunet. the pig, the design of the janitor and the chefs, the ambiance, the setting in both the maw and the necropolis, it's just too similar to ignore"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,"remastered indeed, my friend! tons of work went into this and it shows. i really enjoyed it!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"omg i didnt see that you reached 300k, congrats!! been here since this was a little nightmares channel"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-20,i can't tell you how pleased i am to see this.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-20,"the channel that shows the shadow figure looming over the bed is probably the ferryman that is in the ln audio series, seeing the channel play out fully the figure shows up while the child is in the bed, and ass the screen glitches they both disappear. i believe this channel tells us how the children showed up in the nightmare world before the audio series!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-19,ive been playing both games over and over cause i love these games a lot. ive also gone through theories with chatgpt cause no one else around me has played it or is as excited for this game. such dark meanings
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-21,"after all these years, little nightmares videos are still so great and this game's whole universe is a masterpiece !"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"i have a theory what if the guests are in the maw not to just be served to each other, but perhaps they're turned into candy, after all they do look similar to the corpses at the little nightmares iii trailer candy factory..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-18,why are you so dedicated to this game? like man you're the most dedicated youtuber

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,nice! gotta love a tericho little nightmares vid  im hyped for all your content when ln3 launches
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,1135 thank you so so much for pronouncing it correctly.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-17,nothing wrong with a lil update of a past video. i remember the first one. its like taking me back to the years of some eclectic indie horror games and the people i watched play them. i shoud go back and start those over again.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"its funny you post this now, as i actually rewatched the old one just yesterday while doing research for a ln iceberg video im planning im actually rewatching all your videos on ln kekeke its always a delight to hear your thoughts and theories on this game, thank you for making these!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,023 hey now limon didn't follow you all the way through poppy playtime chapter four just so you can talk about yourself like that!

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"im still kind of new to little nightmares, but this has helped me figure out the lor cant wait to watch you play number three"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,"there was an interest in theory i saw from a youtuber sorry, i dont remember the name and he said that the time loop theory doesnt make sense and that it makes more sense for the thin man to be more of a mold that only specific children can fill. that theory made much more sense to me than the time loop. also, ive never thought that six became the lady. it just never really made sense to me. anyways, great video! these details are very interesting!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,have been waiting for so long that i forgot liltle nightmare 3 existed
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-17,"i liked the contents of the video and even took some consideration of some of them, but i heavily disagree yet also slightly agree on the 10th detail i do think that six does not plan to be the next lady, and i even more heavily doubt that she intends to stay within the confined of the maw but she has been sent on a journey that should've ensured her place as the new lady of the maw. and the thank you for playing screen does not signify her leaving. the reason why i say this, is because the little nightmares franchise has a running theme aside from stagnationobsessionabuse hopelessness. we see it with mono, when he stays in his chair and grows into the broadcaster. we see that characters who refused to give up their hope, get killed brutally as evidenced by the raincoat girl and the runaway kid. i think, in the same manner where mono becomes too depressed by the betrayal that he stays in the chair, six is stripped of the hope of leaving the maw in order to fulfill the vacant position she left empty once she kills the lady. why? because the maw is already submerged at this point. and it doesn't make sense for it to be receiving guests, when we are specifically shown that it only accepts new guests over when it merges from the depths. and i don't think that if there were more than one boat delivering guests over the maw, would the maw waste it's resources to submerge itself only to reemerge again to accept the second round of guests. so the foghorn isn't a signal of a ship arriving, it's a signal that the ship that was unloading it's contents has already left leaving six stranded for yet another year within the maw. it's supposed to hammer in hopelessness within six so she stays and becomes the new lady ensuring that the cycle continues. but my girl is stronger than that. she doesn't belong in this world like her ln page description says"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"tericho, youre a genius my guy!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,1245 i never knew about this room
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-18,"i personally believe there's some sort of audio easter egg or something extra we've missed with the audio in these games, both games have an oscilloscope present referencing a vr game also made by tarsier where you had to decrypt different things and one of them being an oscilloscope like device. also along with the hardcopy of the 1st game a cd of the game music were given along with names for each song. the amount of weird noises that are present in these games are wild but no one actually looks at them example according to tobias lilja, the audio director for little nightmares, the song often referred to as the veronica tv song doesn't contain actual words. instead, it consists of phonemessounds that resemble language but don't form words in any existing human language."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-11,"in the final scene where he lets go of his hand, if you pay close attention to his movements, it looks like mono glances down and then lets go. i think the reason six's hand goes up after mono falls is because mono let go when he puts in the effort to pull him up. in the seven deadly sins, mono represents the arrogance of number 1, so i thought mono's desire to protect six might make him arrogant. i accept the objection."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-09-22,"im a little fuzzy on the continuity here. are these separated by games 1 and 2? which are which? like, the second time we see the janitor in this video hes got his arms back."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-25,18 minutes seven seconds in salute for that child he sacrifices lunch to feed the little six the character that queso is playing as he wasnt hungry
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-04,"i dont know if anyone knows, but this game is heavily based off limbo!! it's also practically the same, but everythings in black in white! i watched my dad play limbo and its just a strong part of my childhood, so to see little nightmares turn that game into something so much interesting and add more lore to their own game while being unique at best, it's also just a reminder that limbo is the oggg i love that game. also he should play the dlc of this game, i thinkn theres like two? and the second game"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-23,"i think that when mono was caught by six at the end of the game, he wasn't wearing his mask witch revealed to six that he was the thin man. after seeing his face, and recognizing him as the thin man, six thought that dropping him and killing him would stop him from becoming the thin man but instead it just caused the cycle to repeat."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-11,i spent the whole game holding sixs hand because it made everything less scary only for her to drop mono to his doom in the end ... very depressing
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-15,mono just a kid with cool powers six and i took that personally
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-01-02,"it's also important to notice that there are several clocks in little nightmares 2. as you progress, the time shown on each clock suggests that time actually moves backwards. a clock in the school shows around seven minutes to six, while a clock in the hospital shows around 13 minutes to six"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-19,funfact  six need to attack 6 times with the mirror to defeat the lady. mono also need to hit 6 times with items to destroy the music box.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-22,mono ether dies a hero or lives long enough to see himself as the villain or literally every protagonist in this storyline
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-03,tall man you took everything from me.. six i dont even know who you are.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-12,"she drops him because she sees his face, for all of the game mono hides his face. but he takes it off when fighting the thin man, so when she catches him she finally recognises him as the thin man. the one who kidnapped her."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-20,six should write a book to all the boys i've doomed before
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-22,thin man the cycle ends here mono i dont even know who you are?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-19,"theory when the thin man kidnaps six, six wasnt in a bad hiding spot, the thin man just remembered where she hid from when he was mono"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-01,"learning the whole story has made me love this series even more. out of all the games i've played in 2021, little nightmares 2 impressed me the most. i really hope they make a ln3, even though the developers said the story is done."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,poor mono he seems like his worst nightmare was just being alone.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-02,"it also makes sense because as mono defeats the thin man with his powers, you can see the thin man holding up his hand telling mono to stop, trying to stop the paradox ther before it keeps going."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-26,so mono just needs to practice running so that he can make the jump without six's help
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-08-31,"ive had this theory for a while and it was that all the enemies ie. the teacher, hunter, doctor, patients, thin man and bullies all know the outcome and whats going to happen especially thin man and thats why they attack mono, to stop the loop from happening and stop the signal tower all together."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"also the fact that the hunter captured six before the events of little nightmares 2 gives a possibly unintentional reasoning to the hunter not even attempting to shoot her at all during the boss fight. this could also support the idea that the hunter wants a form of company in him being alone, which can also be supported by the fake people at the dinner table."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-27,she let him fall because she likely sensed the darkness within him six you little hypocrite
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-03-16,"id have to disagree on sixs reason for dropping mono. its shown throughout the game that six is a sadist. when mono encounters her in her monstrous form, she still demonstrates a trust of him and even shares her music box with him. when mono destroys the music box, it visibly causes her great distress and maybe even harm. then she glares at him when she stands up again, even showing a menacing stance just before the signal tower shows its true form. this means six drops him, not because she can sense some dark power or because she can see his face now as some commenters suggest that makes no sense, as you can show her monos face multiple times throughout the game, but because he hurt her and she received a chance for quick revenge. something she also is shown to have a penchant for when she crushes the head of the first bully you encounter after you free her in the school."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-28,six being the lady actually makes sense since the lady hummed the same tune that six did when trapped
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-27,"i think the reason why six let mono fall because he, in her mind, betrayed her by destroying her music box even though it was to save her. because, when we first see six in her monstrous state and call to her she presents the music box too mono as if to show or share it with him. she only gets violent after he tried to smash it. also, if you look at the way six slowly gets up and stares at mono after finally destroying the music box, her body language seems hostile to me. because to her, that was a safe place, that was her comfort and he took it from her."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,i can memorize every detail of this but not my class lessons.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-24,"theory sixs name comes from the 6th deadly sin, which is gluttony, considering how she always had a serious hunger issue in the original game, from eating normal food to the little gnomes and then the lady, and i think the passengers on the maw back this theory up because of how they eat not stop and are really really fat another thing i forgot to mention which puts the nail in the coffin is that the game was originally going to be called hunger before the developers went with little nightmares edit please read i am not going by the seven deadly sins order. i am basing off the order from dantes inferno. a reading talking about the sins in the three circles of hell. in dantes inferno, gluttons are punished in canton vi which is another way of saying gluttony is the sixth part."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-09-24,"ohhhh shit the thin man was a good guy, and when you die or get captured by the thin man, thats technically the good ending where the world is saved"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-19,i like the little detail when mono opens the thin man's door. there's a blue lightrepresenting sadness shining through but as the door opens more the light begins to turn more pink to show that the thin man realizes that he's been set free.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,"you know, now that ln ii is out, there is an interesting link between the lady and six both of them are very fond of music boxes. remember, in dlc, we knew that the lady has a music box of her own, and listening to it seems to calm her down. and this is the same with six. she likes the music box very much, and it calms her down, too."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-16,mono was actually really cute and him and six were such an adorable duo im so sad that six did that to him
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-11,"my own theory on why six drops mono is a bit different, though i cant say whether its more or less correct. from a psychological standpoint, six may have become attached to her prison in the hunters house in a way, finding comfort in the music box. when mono frees her, he takes away her home and her comfort, even if its with good intentions. he then takes her on a miserable journey that results in near death multiple times and exposure to the world, which her prison hid her from. the only reason she doesnt go back is because theres nothing left to go back to. finally, shes taken by the thin man, further reinforcing the idea that leaving her home was a mistake. during the signal tower part of the story, maybe the tower reflected what she desired, or was a kind of metaphor. she got back everything she lost and was content to stay. then mono barges into her home again, destroys it again, and takes away her comfort again. hes almost like the villain of her story, trying to drag her back out into a world she wants no part of. to that end, why should she save someone whos only brought her misery? im not saying this makes complete logical sense, but emotions, especially tainted with severe mental illness which im certain six has, dont always make sense to begin with. to six, mono took away everything she had, even if her home and coping methods werent healthy, and to someone already as fragile and traumatized as six might be, to her he might appear as the monster the tower portrayed her as, and perhaps from her perspective the monstrous one wasnt her but rather mono. i dont know, but either way thats what i think."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,"another theory on six's name is that the sixth deadly sin is gluttony meaning she was named after the gluttonous creatures she encounters and eventually becomes. take this theory with a grain of salt though i just thought it was interesting so i shared it. also this timeline makes so much sense, great theory's!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-19,i cant be the only person who didnt know the very little nightmares existed until this video...

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-05,"i watched my first snippets of this game less than 24 hours ago, and i'm already so drawn in to the lore, my goodness"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-27,"there's something i want to point out i haven't seen a single youtuber cover. with six letting go of mono, people assume it's because she's lost her trust in mono, or sees the thin man in him. yet, here's the thing. in the scene where the thin man takes six from under the table, you see the shadow of six left behind. i believe this shadow is six's soul. after loosing her soul, her mind and body were under the control of the radio tower. since mono killed the thin man of current, the radio tower needed a new thin man. six, being under the control of the tower, let go of mono well aware of the consequences. six wasn't supposed to be turned normal after becoming her twisted self. so after becoming normal, mono set himself up for his own demise."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-28,monophobia  fear of being alone the tower feeds off of fear and mono's fear is being alone. that makes so much sense !
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-28,"six spent two games getting rescued by others. it's in the first that she's really on her own for the first time, save for the one child who threw her bread."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,this game left us with more questions than answers.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-19,the person in the sketches on the far right could be mono? hence why their face was covered? that would still make sense with the timeline and falling animation looks a lot more similar to that moment.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,another way to explain six's drawings would be that the tower whispered to her about future events with the connection mentioned in this video... to me that makes sense since it would be in the towers best interest to plant the seed of betrayal early so that the paradox can continue.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,everyones little nightmare realizing the next game will release a few years later
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-12-26,i realized why thin man tried to kill mono because he was trying to break the cycle but in the end he kept failing
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-10,"theory that six becomes the lady the lady's powers are seemly she sucks the life out of people to keep herself young. at the end of lns six eats the lady to gain her powers and then sucks the life out off the people on the maw to satisfy her hunger, but this won't satisfy six's hunger forever and since the maw attracts so many guests its a perfect place to satisfy that hunger again. so six will continue to run the maw attracting people to come to the maw to eat and fatten them up just so six can suck out their life force to satisfy her hunger forever and ever, and overtime six will keep growing up until she become the lady herself running the maw just like mono becoming the thin man. its also backed up that once someone comes on the maw they never leave probably because they died to six and their bodies disposed. since, the world is like a time loop six will come back to kill the lady aka herself and start the cycle all over again."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-19,"i think that the thin man actually wants mono to become him, as he was corrupted. if he wanted to stop the cycle, he couldve just killed six."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-22,maybe the reason that there are so many tvs is because mono thin man is trying to give out a message.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,"as six's shadow version helped guide mono to the tower for the timeline repeat, i am guessing that the shadow version is doing the same to six. so less of a lost soul and more of a force instructing six where to go to help her, when in fact the shadow wants the cycle to continue instead."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-12-14,"finally someone who i can relate in terms of timeline. i'm new to the game, played several times making connections and looking at details and so on your explanation is exactly what i feel, though of course you took noticed of very precise details i didn't, but as far as timeline, yes i am with you that. still there are other bizarre things that keep bothering me whatwho exactly are the porcelain kids, or what they represent? what happened exactly at the pale city. this people looked so corrupted and hypnotized, their homes were even neglected, at some point of view we notice that, were the children neglected too, i think. don't really think comics are specifically tied to the games buy still it was very peculiar, when the kids in front of the bonfire say what has she seen? and it looks like sixs has pretty traumatic experiences with the people apart from that she state that sometimes the light makes you see things you don't want, so you escape to dark or so... such a well made explanation..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,it would be amazing if mono could escape form his fate and prison without the help of the past himself and see how he breaks his cycle and six's by stopping her from turning into the lady or confronting her in the next game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-20,"they both become monsters at the perceived end of their journeys. powerful, nightmarish beings. little nightmares indeed."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-18,"i present a little theory each of the tallies may be telling a loop, there are 5 tallys next to mono and when we open the door of the room where thin man is located, it there write 6, so we enter the 6th loop,mono opened the thin man's door for the 6th time."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-12-12,"i've got a theory of what six's story really is the tower corrupted much of the globe as thoroughly as it could. but there were few who tried to stay as isolated from the network as possible, trying to build their own versions of order, away from the tower. but due to have been already touched by the corruption, even their forms of order are delusional twisted. one such family is the nest family. their deformity was that they lost their souls, fractured into tiny glitched pieces, so they appear mostly normal, were it not for the fact their appearances were grotesque enough to refuse to appear in the photos. another is the lady, whose deformity was endless hunger in order to reverse her weakness and physical condition. these three had an arrangement in order to maintain the maw working and keep themselves isolated from the main land. the patriarch and matriarch had two children, twin girls, more beautiful than them, yet souless as well. however, what made these two children special, was that one girl had the power to externalize her void, making people disappear in thin air. the other girl on the other hand needed to keep eating something that was or is alive, getting more powerful and beautiful with each victim she consumed. the latter is named number 6, as she's supposed to be the new lady, as the current one seems to be getting more unhinged and sadistic with the guests she invites in order to get more money to maintain her establishment. the former becomes incredibly jealous of her sister, painting herself, to be even more beautiful than six, ripping her sister's face off from a photo, and then ends their mother, as she planned to have more children. she then took control of the house's insane doll maker and the weary butler by physically disabling the most threatening parts of their bodies, and ordered them to build that phantasy world of hers filled with dolls made from the children her mother intended to adopt and did everything she could to make it seem like she was an only daughter. because of these events, six stopped wearing anything that might have her look like her sister, and started to use her powers to find ways to attract children passing by her home in the hopes one of them could help her take her sister down. eventually she succeeds. however, having grown fond of her latest victim, after her departure from the realm of the living thanks to the pretender, she takes on her coat both to pay tribute and to hide herself from the world. after these events she goes to the mainland in order to destroy the tower for being the reason her family was ruined, only to lose her beloved coat and be caught by the hunter, who wished to let her body give up naturally in order to stuff her as his new daughter. and after the events of this game, in which she and mono unknowingly find the glitched pieces of her soul, and her betrayal, as her hunger finally began to take hold of her, she was instructed by her shadowsoul who either couldn't or refused to return to her body to go to the maw, where she should have gone to in the first place, in order to feast and become all powerful. and she did just that. however, because of the time distortion, she actually went to a past version of the maw before the events in the second game. she made her way to the fortress, where she found her father's hanging corpse and what her family had been truly financing. they had been financing a mad narcissistic creature whose goal was to destroy the bodies of beautiful children and trap their souls in beings know as nomes, under the excuse of protecting them from the tower's corrupting broadcast, using the bodies to fatten the guests and then turn them into tomorrow's menu. a sadistic cycle to behold no doubt about it. as six finally defeats the lady, the guests and satisfies her hunger, she leaves, but her fate in this cycle becomes unclear. what i do believe, is that time in the nest and the maw works differently as well, since it is located far away from the tower's tentacular reach. so she probably remains there in order to become the new lady, going mad from her regret in leaving mono behind, unable to see her reflection not out of vanity, but out of guilt, thus restarting the cycle, and this time try to capture her younger self earlier in order to keep her away from mono and punish her past self. only to fail, leading her younger self to go into the pale city and continue the loop, now returning to a point in which her future self is already the lady and she must defeat again in order to regain the powers the tower stole from her. and that is where we know no more. she either decides to stay and continue the cycle. or she leaves to try and fix her mistakes."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,"so basically he never turned evil, the tower just used his powers to doom the world. he still has the same innocent and pure heart as always. time paradox's cannot be broken, that is why its called a time loop."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-24,"i have an interesting theory six is fated to become the signal tower because he says that after six kills the lady and loses her soul and goes on to become a monster that drains the life out of everyone, that sounds too familiar. then she goes on to become the signal tower itself and this is where everything started. she needed something to bring the bodies back to her so she manipulated her younger self into dropping mono and releasing him to her. she traps mono and loses him again and again in a never ending cycle."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-08-08,"408 for the people who didn't know.. thats the thin man aka mono hanging over that chair. knowing that little nightmares ii is a prequel, and little nightmares 2 basically comes before little nightmares 1. this part in the game indicates that thin man aka mono hung himself in the signal tower at some point, because the thin man kept failing and failing at ending the loop that he's stuck in and got tired of failing, so he decided to hang himself to end the loop. and to know this is true, if you look at the chair thin man's body is hanging over, that's the same chair mono was sitting in at the very end of little nightmares 2, when he was growing older into the thin man. and also, the body hanging over the chair has the exact same suit thin man was wearing in little nightmares 2. i'm not 100 sure if this is true, this is just my theory."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-14,i am happy to return to this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-18,"i think the use of a hunter was intended differently, while children in the us have to think about guns and violence of the sort regularly which is horrifying, the game was made by swedish people and we don't have that same concern as children here. but we do have one thing that i think connects much better to the fear of faceless hunters specifically. in sweden we have allemansrtten all man's law which means you can walk freely in any forest, pick berry's and mushrooms and camp there for at least one night. it's amazing and i, as well as many other swedish children spent a lot of time in forests. but hunters can also be in these forests, when you walk around you might see a hunters tower and i remember having to wear reflective vests on during hunting season so we wouldn't be mistaken for animals. hearing distant gunshots in the forest and being afraid of a hunter mistaking you for an animal was pretty terrifying, thankfully accidents like that are very rare but the fear is still there. that's why i think they have the faceless hunter, you never really see them, just hear their shots and see their towers. hope the cultural context was helpful"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-02,"in regards to the whole purpose of why six dropped mono the official little nightmares twitter account said that in the tower mono hurt six more than he realized. i think what theyre implying is that by destroying her music box he was hurting her physically and emotionally. remember, six doesnt really seem all that distressed in her monster form and perhaps from her perspective everything seems fine and she isnt initially aggressive towards mono and when he calls her she presents her music box to him as one would show a friend something they enjoy. only when mono attacks the music box does she become hostile. and youll notice that in the first few phases she only attacks if you call her or get too close. also notice how she physically reels in pain when u strike the box so in my opinion six did view mono as a companion and even a friend of sorts but when he destroyed her box, the only thing that brought her any sort of comfort or relief playing into the theme of escapism present in ln2 thats when she decides to drop mono since from her perspective he hurt her and destroyers the thing that made her happy and feel safe. while from our perspective mono was just trying to save his friend, six perspective of the events in the tower are implied to be drastically different. great video and i just wanted to add to the discussion with some of the hints the team has given us and the subtle hints during the game that lead to this conclusion. im not saying im 100 right but i think her betrayal is much more interesting from this angle than the whole she was never your friend angle. thats just my viewpoint tho. btw this is not me defending sixs actions but rather just adding to the discussion since i think six is a much more complex character than just her being a twisted child, and while she is very selfish and what she did to mono was wrong the thought of things being different from her perspective gets one thinking"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,"when i saw this pop up on spooky day i said, aloud in a room by myself, oh. immediately. did i already watch all of them? yes. am i about to spend 2 odd hours rewatching all of them? . . . . yes."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-16,"i really like six actually. it's one thing seeing a welldesigned hero, but it's another seeing a welldesigned villain. it's not every day that you see a villain that is for the most part, powerless and is the underdog of the story."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-01,there is a moment where you see one of the chefs entering a guest room and doing something to him. implying they do kill and eat the guests too. a sick cycle of hunger. also janitors name is roger and its implied he got his face from the doctor who had multiple masks in the hospital video is awesome
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,"it's heavily implied that six only starts feeling hunger after leaving the signal tower, like she had lost a part of her soul. this is why her hunger is growing, and each time she needs to eat something bigger and more alive, she's hungry for a soul. btw i do not defend her actions, i played the games in the order they came out and i will never recover from the betrayal"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-14,"about the little nightmares 2 betrayal and sixs behaviour towards mono couldnt she just fear growing up? or him growing up? we know adults are bad and mono appears to be a little tallerolder than her granted that might just be to tell boy and girl apart a little more easily in this art style. if mono getting closer to that door is symbolism of him growing up her stopping him makes sense and so does her apprehension. then he goes through the struggle of getting back to her in the tower. he lets go of his paper bag, opens the door and becomes more mature aka he is growing up. then he hurts her in his eyes he is doing whats best for hersaving her but she realizes hes too far gone and she lets go. unknowingly forcing him to grow up faster"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-03,i usually never tip but this video is just too good not to. i really enjoyed how you structured the video and arguments. i have such love and fond memories of this game and it makes me happy every time someone makes such a lengthy yet well formulated video. it's truly amazing!  also i very much enjoyed the magnus archives reference d
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-28,"i believe cici is not six but instead raincoat girl, because as far as we know, rg had the yellow raincoat first and not six. if rg was taken to the nowhere with the raincoat, then it would explain why otto knows the raincoat. if six was taken to the nowhere with the raincoat, that wouldnt make sense because she didnt have it first, rg did. and, the reason six took the raincoat in ln2 is because she recognized it as rgs, and rg saved her in vln. six was trying to help rg with the boulder at the end, but the cliff ended up breaking. i like to imagine she took it as a sign of recognizing her savior from that time no idea how long ago vln is from ln2 and wanting to honor rgs memory. idk im a six empathizer and just want all these kids to have a happy ending so i take what i can get"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-27,"it really is about many things. humanity of today, sucked into tvs and plastic surgery, even stuck in the loop at the doctors for it. the gluttony of wanting more even with more than enough on the table in front of you. but also, the scariness of being a child, that growing up in bad situations, as much as you try to run from it, sometimes, you become the same. or, you come out stronger."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-01,ive been so in love with this series since it came out and ive been craving new content. you made my halloween so much better even though i spent it alone. thank you
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-23,the part when you spot the janitor in the dark room in the dlc almost gave me a heart attack
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,this series made me so happy and also made me want to make my own analysis videos!!! thanks for being so inspiring and also for the great content!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-19,"i've literally never heard of little nightmares before but i'm kind of obsessed with the aesthetic. it has notes of behind you, as well as the artwork of boris groh and trevor henderson, and it's creating a sense of bonechilling dread that i've only felt in my worst nightmares and extremely wellexecuted horror. so well done."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-10,"i always thought that the maw was under some kind of curse or spell that made the people who stayed there eat. forcing them to eat, so to speak. so something that triggers this hunger that also affects six. you can see from the guests that something alive seems to trigger an even greater gluttony, and that the regular meat is not longer interessting if six is there. when six met the gnome, it was alive. i always interpreted it as her not knowing how to help herself. that at some point dead meat or bread simply wasn't enough anymore to satisfy her hunger. i didn't interpret it as six willingly killing someone even though she had the chance to eat something else. it always looked to me as if she, like the guests, was forced to do that. perhaps triggered by the power of the lady. that this power forces people to eat. or rather forces people to eat human flesh, preferably living human flesh. i also assume that six no longer feels this hunger in the end. i'm probably wrong, though.  because the kid doesn't feel this hunger either."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,what a perfect little nightmare to enjoy on halloween!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-04,"well, thats a huge amount of work! ngl, im so proud to be a part of this fandom with so many talented and passionate people! it is so beautiful that little nightmares has become a franchise and i really hope it will live long enough to become a worldfamous classic!"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-22,"15643 hit harshly too close to home, i absolutely admire the way you speak and the way you analyse things, is amazing, being nearly a 17yo teenager i absolutely agree, there are points where you find the grotesque in this game just a surreal depiction of our own reality, wanting to think that our reality is so much more dreamier than this game but in reality, it just shows our perception on the world as young individuals, this game will i think always confuse me but as much as i watch analytical videos on this the more i love it even more, this is an amazing video on this game and maybe you should make a gameplay one when the third game comes out!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-22,"its worth noting that in little nightmares i, by the time six reaches the nome with the sausage, shes already been through the kitchen where the sausages are made and the lair where the meat for the sausages comes from. by now she knows that the sausages, or at least some of the meat in the maw, is made out of children, so she has to make the choice between knowingly commiting cannibalism and unknowingly committing cannibalism by eating the nome."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-03,"i think i understand, i don't think it's possible to. i can relate to your ramblings about life and nature and to call them ramblings is not meant to diminish them. i think that navigating this life has a lot to do with being able to recognize, understand, and predict patterns. we may not be able to control the cycles themselves, but i think when we have a grasp on ourselves within the larger context, we're better equiped to approach these cycles with understanding, knowing, expectation. and from there, we're able to break out and defy expectations  i appreciate your feeling and dedication to the themes in these games. i love this series."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-10,"maybe you said this and i missed it, but i dont think the nowhere is a dream world, its just accessed through dreams. but once a specific event happens maybe going with the ferryman, wherever he wants to take you, you get fully sucked into the nowhere with no hope of escape"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-13,"i think mono's story is very interesting in a sense that... mono was probably afraid of growing up. at the end, he accepts his fate, that he'll have to, that he can't stop it. and at the end, he becomes one. but when the door opens, his younger self opens, he chases after it, after that fleeting childhood, while terrible, had its moment mostly because of six's company. adult him is alone, trapped, in a world of nothing but flesh and eyes that he can only pretend are not there. how much we would give to go back... his adult self took six to the tower and gave her the music box. i think it's because he knew six loved that music and, while this world twists everything, he probably tried to bring her comfort in all that, that's maybe why he chased after the 2 he wanted to help them although this world makes it do more bad than good but you get the point as it is confirmed that while she was mutated, she was somewhat happy, which probably is why she betrayed you. the hanged man maybe would refer to a breaking point. if we assume the cycle breaks, and instead of being perpetually living the cycle, mono would've maybe done it. the door does have an eye oddly similar to his door's. the chair is too tiny for his huge body. i like the idea of his top body going up rather than down, where the light of the room is coming from. the only escape from this world... is death."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-19,"i feel like the doctor wasn't necessarily evil or wanted to take you back to school. i think he was simply worried for his patients and wanted to get you away, because you technically broke in a hospital and even took one of his patients off life support, so i think he's trying to catch you and chase you away. maybe he's even a good guy, trying to help people by replacing people's broken or missing limbs with working porcelain prostetics, and maybe even trying to find a cure to the tv signals and how they affect the adults."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-04,"damn man. the lore and shit is really cool, but your way of writting and reading is really god damn entertaining"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-10,"very late comment, but what i never see brought up about the man in the beginning of the first game is that the chair is still standing upright. usually, you'd have to kick that down to, you know. the man appears tall, yes, but is also unusually high up from that chair. i don't think he necessarily did it himself."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-02,this whole thing was amazing!!! thanks for this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-03,"i think i am halfway through the video so i am putting my thoughts here with the hunter, i love him, he's my favorite antagonist of the whole series. i have autism to i tend to fixate on something in whatever media i enjoy, and i think part of the reason why i find the wilderness chapter so comforting prechase scene is because i grew up rural in the 2000s and i mean rural. i've literally lived in a home like his before on the edge of some woods growing up, so usually when i replay that chapter i like to have mono walk around, take in the ambience, and then i have him trash the hunter's home by throwing his stuff around. it's also not so much the chase scene that scares me, but it's hearing him when you're still in the house. the footsteps, what i think sounds like a sneeze, it's very reminisce of when the person who was looking after me not a parent would get in a bad mood and as a kid i had to learn how to tell the difference between possible moods based on the soundslike, heavy, loud footsteps  bad mood. also, going out to the hunter's shed, that looming dread that's building up when you hear the grotesque sounds of something happening and knowing your only means forwards is to go past that. the chase scene is adrenalinebuilding because you're trying to not get shot, but the leadup before anything happens does a good job at making me feel anxious. with the hospital area, i had to get emergency surgery at 13 because my appendix decided to selfdestruct i was out of school for two months and my recovery was so rough that it traumatized me they had to put me on morphine, which is a very strong painkiller to give a freshlyturned teenager so as far as hospitals go, even when they're clean and modern i'm still very, very terrified of them. this summer has been nothing but doctor visits for me because my thyroid kicked and was severely underfunctioning not losing weight even after i lost my appetite and couldn't eat, fainting, no energy even though i sleep almost all the time, ect and i have a rapidlygrowing tumor not cancerous thankfully!! that i will have to get removed sometime this winter, which, unfortunately for me, is in my lower stomach area, and the surgery for removing that is very similar to an appendectomy so my medical ptsd has been creeping back in and i keep getting anxiety sweats and having trouble sleeping just thinking about it, in addition that ever since late may i've been to a couple of different hospitals  have had so much blood drawn, you'd think i'd have lost my fear of hospitals by now, but i'm still just as scared of them as before. so, the doctor's level makes me anxious, more anxious than the school by a loooong shot even with the teacher chase sequence"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,oh yes more little nightmares content!!! thank you
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-21,"on the aspect of people defending six, i will not say she doesnt do bad things, but what i think most people fail to recognisebecause they dont have kids is a child's capacity for things like manipulation, violence due to emotion, emotional misunderstanding, and the worst thing of all, impulses. kids dont have a control of impulses because they have not learned that you need to stop them to coexist, so if six was craving the nome over the sausage, im not surprised she chose the nome. that is to say, i think she craved the nome due to her hunger that was triggered by her split from the thin man, but nonetheless a child wouldn't compartmentalize that, she would think i want to eat that nome and she has no authority figure in this world, so, she does. so, with the case of mono, you do a succinct job of categorizing all the times mono fails for six, and yes, a kid would drop you for that, because they don't have a full conception of death even after experiencing deathi know i sure didnt as a kid. sorry, just the way you went with that argument bothered me because there were some good points that i don't think were brought up. edit i also want to mention, my headcanon for six is that before she ended up in the nowhere she was in a mental institution based on her clothes in very little nightmaresand her questionable actions, where i assume she first fully crossed into the nowhere, she has a full white outfit for some reason, but not a hospital gown, it reminds me of the sweats they would give kids in mental hospitals when they first come in. not to mention, some of the questionable things that six does could be linked to autism in my personal, autistic, opinion."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-24,"and here i am, still referring to them as shoes, ghetto grocery bag, trippy, mumkee, and the pulgas. anyone from special edd here?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-07,"i kinda expect that in game 3 an enemy to be dealth with by geting them in the same room as 6, her just wandering, looking for things to consume every time she gets the hunger. she would be the worst menace to every children, she could follow them anywere. or maybe she would become midle sized, growing like the thin man, free to grow now that she is not in danger anymore, she would be faster yet she would still be able to sneak into most places, only dors would block her path."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-22,"i don't think mono or six are bad in any way. little nightmares is a game that implies a lot of what it wants to say, and six could potentially have known what that sausage was made out of, guests or an amalgamation of children, whilst in contrast, she never knew nomes were human to begin with. the issue is, that we don't know why six dropped mono, why she ate the nome, why mono did not attempt to escape on his own despite having the power to manipulate the very space around him. and maybe we will never know, because the game is not made for children, directly implying that in a world made of children's nightmares, we are only the observers, thus leaving us in the dark, because we don't belong in the nowhere, leaving us with the best thing to do, staying morally grey, viewing every perspective, as that's all that can be done."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-18,the answer to curing six is obvious get that girl some fucking pants and shoes.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,"11755 funny how you're talking about how the customers look more like a wave and in the background there is a drawing of the great wave of kanagawa 12015 i think six made the decision to eat the poor thing because she thinks it's not another kid, it's something else, another species, so for her it was better to eat him than eat the sausage that she knew it was made of children. i believe we, as the player, think that she has committed cannibalism, but i don't think six herself believes it was cannibalism. with that same reasoning, i don't think six thought that eating the lady at the end of the game was cannibalism because she believes the adults are different species, too."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-15,isnt mono basically just one? if there are 6 children and you want to give them each a number name to differentiate them

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,great video !
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-20,"i took it for granted while playing that six and mono had basically the same goal to find a way out of this nightmare. you referred to mono dragging six deeper and deeper into danger out of some sense of heroism instead of staying somewhere safe, but that comment makes numerous assumptions. even if neither one has any ambition to return to the 'real world' or doesn't miss anyone there, where have we gone that would be safe for the kids to stay longterm? the forest? well, we don't really know that. yeah, we only see the hunter as the big bad in the forest, just like we also only see the teacher and the bullies in the school, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing else there. much less that they could find anything to eat in the long term. for the record, i usually assume six acted out of sheer malice when she dropped mono since i haven't seen anything in the published media to suggest otherwise or give her another motivation. he broke her music box so six tried to break him. six is 'the little nightmare' after all so it doesn't really boggle my mind that her motivation could be simple spite."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-10,the best definition of time loop
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-03,what if in little nightmares there is going to be a character that breaks the loop and everything becomes normal until some thing happeneds
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-16,"another theory is that the thin man is actually trying to help mono and stop him from being betrayed by six, and thats why he kidnaps her."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-07,my boy baggy didn't deserve this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-27,still cannot believe 6 betrayed mono
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-15,"little nightmares is one of the most impressive game series i think i've ever seen. not only is the second one just as amazing as the first one, but both still hold a style nobody's ever been able to replicate."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,imagine if thin man meet the lady by the boat man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-11,the owners confirmed that the lady and six are not the same
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-20,"ill admit, momo being the thin man is pretty obvious, but six as the lady? no way!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-11,i do t think its a loop but rather its a cycle. theres always a thin man and always a gesha.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-26,the moment when six walks behind the lady and then she sing a melody  and brush her hair its very creepy and make me feel to nervous
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-14,"it really is a loop as even the creators have said we've witnessed the whole story of little nightmares 1  2 and the spinoff that did add story very little nightmares, and thats why ln3 is going to be a whole new story revolving around our two new characters in a new world, the loop has been completed and now we look outside of it"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-09,the fact that thin was trying to save mono from turning into him almost if its happened before
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-01,id love a third game that ends the vicious cycle
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-22,i love this series so much. i get so pretentious artsy person over it. the theme of the first two seem to be how kids who grow up in scary and abusive environments can grow up to be just like the adults who terrorized them. sometimes trauma doesn't make you soft or meek but selfabsorbed and hostile.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-26,the devs said that the lady and six have no relation. the references to the first game are just preludes.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-15,dude why am i finding your vids at 3 am like i just scrolled upon the one where she ate everything before coming here
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-24,like mom like daughter and like father like son
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-27,coryxkenshin her name is six with a sasha in front
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-15,"when six and mono were separated in doll building, mono found her breaking a dolls fingers. when mono and six incinerated the ceiling crawler, six warmed her hands by the fire that killed him. we can't forget six's eerie hunger she developed after mono saved her, and her hunger for people."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-06,mono and the chair grow up together
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-27,my personal theory is that six is named six because thats how many times the cycle has repeated
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-25,little nightmares the game of wow this looks interesting to pain...... suffering...... loss...... tragedy...... morality........ six
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,that's not true because the devs said six and the lady are not related in any way and she only gets the powers after she kills the lady
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,i had no idea of the humming and the music box with the same tune wow mind blown
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,"i haven't heard anyone refute this with the fact that six leaves the maw, leaving this place to die, which is why it's not a time loop..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-20,after the thin man kidnapped six she lost part of herself. she comsumes life energy and she got that ladys life force. hence why there are connections. the question is why sixs shadow is watching her consume life.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-05,an infinite nightmares where you become your worst nightmare...
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-13,the thing i dont quit get is that six can also tp through televisions as she does in ln2 to escape at the end
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-31,i love this game so much man!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-06,i just love the story of ln even tho it keeps looping i cant wait to see the story of ln3
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-16,bro earned a sub for some reasons
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,i think i also remember in the runaway kid the geisha had a similar music box with the same tune just like six had when she was a mutated monster and also in little nightmares 2 when she was locked in the basement
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,i can't wait to see how they tie the third into this it's gonna be good i know it
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-03,i remember there was a fan comic of this where mono and six both fell and shows them both turing into the thin man and the lady
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-29,thats actually really cool.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-04,"so the lady is six, i've been having this argument with my friend forever"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-10,one thing i also noticed is that in the very start of the first game you cam see the hung corpse of what seems to be the tall man possibly meaning that the cycle may be different this time around
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-05,"i never noticed the dolls, bumming it music box resembling the maw!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-04,they are parallels but different people
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-06,i think its like a older version of them and the older is tryna save the little ones like the thin man or idk maybe the lady too
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-09,little nightmares 3 boutta change all the lore or its just about to have its own lore
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-06,so if thin man capture mono he tell mono and break the loop
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-03,fun fact because they are the same people just warning them about what their gunna be like in their future and thats why their trying to stop them
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-22,those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-16,"which makes me wonder, how was the first thin man made. since some theorise six drops mono after seeing his resemblance to the thin man."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-06,"so lady is six, stucked in loop"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-02,i love this game
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-21,i mean it doesnt help the fact that their own choices perpetuate their own nightmares and creating their own monsters
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-30,the lady and six are the same person... this is what aim thinking when i finish the game
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-17,i thought 6 just had the hunger that everyone else their had and by consuming the lady absorbed her powers
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-23,after dropping mono six does indeed start humming the music box melody like the lady does
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-08,cant wait for the third one
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-20,"if six isnt the lady that means the first girl we seen drowning didnt actually drown but wake up from her nightmare, or teleported to a different place, possibly could become the lady who knows"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-03,"what iff six held onto that music box, because of her mother aka the lady. she hopes one day to reach her and the music gives her comfort because it's the same hum from her mother. she's abandoned and along her journey realises that. she's betrayed, and is consumed with negative emotions. she betrays mono because the music box was her only comfort therefore in her head mono betrayed her too. because when she tries to show her music box to him, she's very gentle and shoves him lightly but he betrays her, she can't trust anyone anymore. at that moment all she wanted was to kill mono and try to protect what she loves. at the end when she's normal, she becomes kinda evil, staring at him from hatred. she wanted him gone, in her mind it was not saving her. that's why the thin man gave her back what she wanted after thinking long and hard on that chair. he planned to give her what she wanted and save his younger self from her, to let go. later on when she finds her mother the lady, she sees her pictures hidden on the walls by clothes which conformed her she was never loved therefore six lost the comfort she held dear even after music box was destroyed she decided to go to her mother personally, she wanted to protect what she loved but after what she found out she no longer has any love for anyone. as she gets close to the lady, seeing how her mother only cared about her beauty. she wanted revenge. so far she has let go of goodness, becoming the little nightmare. she kills and consumes her, for all the suffering she has caused six. from pure hatred, when she ate the nome, she did not care, when she let go of mono she did not care. i bloody hate her. so she becomes a monster in a regular form. compared to the distorted ones. in this world, like mono whoever has power and strong enough can live through this world from children and grow to become adults as they can protect themselves. just like mono, and now six. six can now grow to become an adult, just like all the survivors are now adults however, all of them are evil, they hate children because they know if they grow up more monsters will form."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-07,and can't wait for part 3
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-12,six is mister janitor now
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-27,didn't the devs say that that wasn't 6
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-22,thin man is trying to stop mono
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-05,the nowhere is expanding by every second just as the universe
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-11,its so cool!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-24,"in this game u all have to learn about fate and situations,"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-04,"even though it may be interesting to theorize about the events happened in the game, i prefer it more when a game explains itself, rather than leaving us with a lot of unanswered questions and clues. i wish we had direct answers!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-12,"there's also a scene where you jump on top of an elevator to ride it up. you can see the lady inside. as the elevator goes up, the lady looks up at the ceiling as if she knows you're there which would make sense since she would have remembered riding on top of the elevator and knows her past self is there."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-27,i thought i had all the knowledge about little nightmares
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-01,so in the third game coming out we can say that the new kids low and alone will break the loop
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-23,i want to see a battle between mono and six as their strongest forms
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-22,this now got me worried for the 2 protagonists in the next ln game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-10,even cycles can end...
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-08,"it's their nightmare, a nightmare of their making"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-04,just like a nightmare!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-06,so is the third game going to have somehow connect back to how mono came out of the tv in the beginning of the game continuing the loop? or would the third game be its own thing
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-11,the world repeat like an endless nightmare
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-05,"there were five other lady's before six, thats why she is called six. the lady she murdered was the fifth lady so six becomes the sixth lady"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-15,this is what will happen to the world if adults are fully dependent on their desires one day.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-12,well there's also that point in little nightmares 2 that six ended up with what looks like her soul being trapped which leads her to constantly be hungry and absorb all life around her
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-09,i feel like mono is the main character because i think if he died regularly he would've restarted and remembered everything giving him the chance to get out the loop
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-01,"the little nightmares twitter page debunked the whole everyone was trapped in an endless loop, ages ago. a fan posted a meme saying the actions of all the characters were pointless because everyone was stuck in a loop, to which the twitter page responded, all of them? hm. this was rather obvious from the start given six chose to leave the maw rather than stay. its theorized there is actually a cycle of successors where a new child will usurp and replace the former host of a living structure to keep it alive. six was not the lady but she was meant to be her new replacement, but chose to leave the maw, stealing the lady's powers and leaving the maw to die. for more info i really recommend pro theorists, itsjustjord, itstimetotheorize and superhorrorbro they have a really good track record in theorizing."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-08,"the world of little nightmares is destined to repeat itself. such as generational trauma is to repeat itself, unless an outsode force influences change"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-09,this is interesting considering the theory is that little nightmares 2 is a prequel to the first game so its almost like all of this inevitable and are destined to happen
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-15,hold on let him cook
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,"i just love the back to back i've played simpsons parody games before oh wait, no i haven't. and i've never played little nightmares before oh wait, i have."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,mark has amnesia everything has come full circle
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,the fact that he has absolutely no memory of playing little nightmares is one of the most quintessentially mark things ever
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,i fully support the idea of mark replaying little nightmares so he can play the 2nd and third game and even reanimal since it's made by the og developers of little nightmares!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,310 well now you have to play little nightmares 2 mark
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-20,the fact mark appearently doesn't remember the one hour long ending credits incident is probably for the best
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-19,"i first discovered little nightmares when i watched marks playthrough of it. i became so obsessed with it that i bought and played it myself despite already knowing the entire story and known lore. then i heard a sequel was coming out, to which i literally counted the days leading up to its release. ive never done that for any other game. im currently studying film at university with an interest in horror, hoping one day ill be able to write my own film scripts. little nightmares has become a huge horror influence for me and i would even say it has completely altered my perspective on the genre. it quickly became not only my favorite horror game, but my favorite video game of all time. and the reason i discovered the game was because of marks playthrough. i owe my discovery of the game and my newfound perspective on horror all to mark. so the fact that he doesnt even remember playing it is giving me really confusing emotions."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-21,i really enjoyed the original little nightmares playthrough and it always bummed me out that he never did the second. i did not expect the answer in this video of all things.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-19,i find it deeply ironic that he looked at himself playing little nightmares and went i have a theory that's not me when i distinctly remember his theory for little nightmares was that there were a bunch of aliens running around wearing masks because they weren't actually human. lol.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,he said he never played little nightmares 1 with so much conviction that i was genuinely baffled for a moment
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,mark calling himself a doppelgnger from when he played the original little nightmares was not on my 2025 list
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,209 the dementia of '25
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,142 you know mark has been playing horror games for so long when he literally forgets an entire playthrough of little nightmares

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,this game is inspired heavily by little nightmares 2 thats why you have no recollection of some of the stuff or the beginning specifically its very similar to the second one
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,i was literally rewatching his little nightmares series today he needs to play the second game i swear
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,to think we couldve gotten another little nightmares playthrough because mark forgot he played it is hilarious
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,mark doesn't remember because off the unskippable credits at the end of the game. he nearly went mad lmfao
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-24,i say this is your chance to experience little nightmares for the first time all over again because i would really love to see you play little nightmares 2... and definitely wouldnt mind watching you play little nightmares 1 all over again thru fresh eyes.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-23,the fact that at 2700 mark says why am i so small and then homer immediately says why you little? almost like an oaf asking the same question is so funny to me.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-20,"mark, i say this from the bottom of my heart and i fully mean it i would love if you decided to replay little nightmares and, if you felt like it, followed up with little nightmares 2! your original playthrough is still one of my all time favorites, and i would adore to see what your thoughts and reactions to the game would be nowadays. it was so fun back then, and i'm sure it would be a delight to see you tackle the games after such a long time!!! in any case tho, thank you for being an awesome guy! you and your editors are absolutely wonderful and have saved me more than you could ever imagine"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,724 when he said the what if i didnt run once again it felt cinematic

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,"honestly, i wouldn't mind seeing mark go back and play ln1 to get a refresher, because i bed it'd still be funny as hell also the credits have become way shorter since in that game. full timeline of little nightmares stuff produced is little nightmares, the dlc for little nightmares, very little nightmares, and then finally little nightmares 2. full timeline of the little nightmares stuff in chronological order of story is actually very little nightmares, little nightmares 2, the dlc for little nightmares, and then little nightmares."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,"now a very nerdy yet simple explanation on why you can run faster when going diagonal basically the programming system counts going foward, back and to the sides as if your player walked a square to whatever direction, it's a easy fix to avoid this but in quicker low budged companies, this isnt that important, so the system counts like you are walking two squares per x amount of velocity."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,mark should totally play both little nightmares games now.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,when you play so many games for the last decade you forget what you've actually done. it all just becomes one. but must be nice having all those recordings as memories to look on

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-18,"i know what the guests eat and u find out throughout the game you will find the janitor in chapter 2 wrapping kids in those paperthingies, then he hangs them onto a catroll. in the beginning of chapter 3, the kitchens, you see the catrols again where you have to hang onto. sometimes theres one of the bags with kids in them hanging on a rod. also, the catrols lead to the kitchens. you all know what happens in kitchens... then in the end of chapter 3 you have to hang on another catrol throughout the washroom. once you survive the chase scene of the chefs, you hang onto a catrol. that catrol leads to chapter 4 the guests we also saw that the chefs use children to fill food like the fish in the main kitchen. that's one of the death scenes. the food that the guests eat is mostlikely also filled with kids. the kids in the beds in chapter 1 end up in chapter 4 also, we see a guest getting chopped off so i think that they use the guests for meat. how else do they get meat on a giant boat on the sea? also, the guests are chanting something at the start of chapter 4. if you listen closely you can hear them singing 'come and chop me off'. now if this isnt enough evidence i dont know what is."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-12,"the hunter is one of the only monster in the little nightmares series that actually seems insane to me. most of the others seem like theyre just complacent in an insane world chefs, guests, or actively evil lady, teacher. the hunter actually seems insane, like he needs help. given that the city is so messed up he seems like a guy that has gone into pure survival mode and just sees everyone else as a threat. hes suffering from extreme paranoia and aggression, which are common results from someone living through a traumatic environment. it seems like hes started delving deeper into taxidermy and has tried to use it to cope with fear and loneliness. if you think about the taxidermied family he has made, it might be a sign if him desiring normalcy. he needs to be kept somewhere that he cant hurt people anymore, but also where he might be able to heal."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-31,it's actually really sad when you think that the thin man is mono. mono seems like a really nice kid he didn't know he needed six so when he saw her he actually wanted to help her escape and if only six didn't let him go they could've been friends as adults but six does show signs of psychopathy in both games so probably not but it is a nice thought.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-11,"this game is some horrific amalgamation between coraline, spirited away, and some other horrific saga i can't remember"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-25,1349 that cook be breathing hard just walking damn he needs some cardio
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-12,i cant see six the same way again after what she did in the sequel.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-24,i just realized six leaves a trail of footprints in the kitchen and that's why the chef's run to your hiding spot looking down the the more you know
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-03,when i saw the cook man that can't be worse! three more cooks appear
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-04-04,imagine as the door opens you hear a voice saying congratulations on passing the first level.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-11-02,"watching this with what i can remember of japanese yokai makes me compare them to specific ones, especially with the izakaya at the end. the main character could be a hitotsumekozou, a kind of one eyed monklike creature that's mostly benevolent. the 'janitor' is a tenagajin, almost literally long arm man. the 'cooks' and 'customers' are kowai, gluttonous ghosts. while the 'geisha' is some species or combination of onna, i'd lean towards kageonna or honeonna. kage is shadow and hone is bone just the face though, although only the honeonna is violent. if this is in a jigoku realm then any mirror could be an ungaikyo, true face mirror which would harmscare yokai away."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-02-09,"it's interesting that the protagonist in this game isn't any better than any of the antagonists. the protagonist doesn't bother attempting to help fellow children, doesn't even acknowledge them, and then devours the boy who turned into a nome, even after he gave her bread, and then started trying to help her more by handing her a sausage instead of running away."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-22,the sound design in this game is absolutely breathtaking. so many little obscure details put to work make this such an eerie masterpiece of a play. love it.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-11-04,2233 scared the shit out of me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-17,i always kinda liked that you get to see these monsters doing their normal routines when they're not actively hunting you down. mainly the chefs doing the dishes and making meals from almost certainly cannibalized meat.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-11-13,why do i watch these kinds of vids at night before i go to sleep?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-11-10,the new coraline game looks great!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-04,"i have the impression that the guy behind this game was totally inspired by who's hungry. a short horror film with a similar idea and atmosphere, i definitely recomend it. great game btw"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-11-29,"gonna watch this over and over again to memorize the steps on how to escape from all the boss. thanks pal, this will really helps me a lot"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-03-29,"this game is crazy... just watching it is creepy, i can't imagine playing it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-08-18,"this is like spirited away, but it has the darker version."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-10-23,who knew tim burton made video games too
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-11-02,"the bosses are so skittish. like the faintest of sounds sends them into a full on frenzy of just frantically searching for this little noise like, what could it be?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-03-02,"yeah i never want to play this game again, my anxiety levels were going through the roof playing this shit"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-06-09,2011 there's two? nobody said there were two
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-12-17,i was always surprised how these two chefs manage to feed all these guests.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-01-19,"absolute nightmare fuel. i'm not a gamer, but this is really fascinating. well made, indeed."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-11-12,1112 that was so satisfying. it was so funny when you heard the sadistic bastard screaming too.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-11-01,"2655 admit it, we all laughed at that one guest that fell."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-07-02,"the people behind this game perfectly understood what good horror is. it manages to keep a constant flow of creepiness, spiked by stressinducing situations, without relying on jumpscares or gore. if you haven't spoiled the game yet by watching the entire vid, you should go and try it for yourself!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-01-11,"i wasn't so sure bout this game in the beginning and boy was i wrong, an absolute masterpiece of sound, music, graphics etc..."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-07-26,2233 somebody once told me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-05-31,want it to be even scarier? check out my little nightmares boss video done in first person perspective! httpsyoutu.bemjpe5lb4hhs
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-11-17,"i like how little nightmares has slowly became a game that shows how a mouse views the world and what they need to do to survive. i think i also like it because no dialogue is said between the characters, no skill tree, its not outlast or alien isolation or the evil within, it is its own world with its own mythology, lore, characters, backgrounds, and environments. i praise it for everything that it is and how nobody can or is trying to replicate it"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-12-10,1301 pausing at this point in time shows you that the chef is wearing some sort of maskfalsehead
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-12-18,this is still nervewracking when i'm just watching.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,it puzzles me how the ferryman can think bringing kids to the nowhere is protecting them. maybe it was a dreamlike paradise once until the adults started forcing their way inside and turning into monsters?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,it was actually really fun lore theorizing with everyone else in the comments of the podcasts.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i think that the ferryman is still a villain here, using manipulation tactics to trap noone in the nowhere, rather than actually intending to help her. i also believe that cicisisicece not sure if theres an official spelling might actually be the girl from very little nightmares, remember that six didnt start out with her raincoat. edit i added my thoughts about the ferryman."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i love otto as a villain. a man so desperate to find his lost sister, that he doesn't realize what may have got her there in the first place. the nowhere lures kids who feel sad or like no one cares for them. as seen with how otto puts dreams first, noone second. otto is causing kids to go to the nowhere by trying to find it. which his terrible determination may have been what caused cece to accept the ferrymans offer. otto is what makes a good villain, terrible person, understandable goals, but puts goals over what's right. little nightmares writers are so good!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"something that wasnt really touched on was the fact that, in episode 6, while noone is hiding in the chest, she sees a yellow raincoat, and otto perks up a bit when she says this. also thinking that the woman shes hiding from might be the pretender or something related to her and this is before very little nightmares. bonus note every place in little nightmares 3 is described in the podcast"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i'm not so sure six is otto's sister, simply because the yellow raincoat didn't originally belong to six  in very little nightmares, the girl with the braid had the yellow raincoat first. then this child in white gets it. and while a lot of people suspect they are actually six, i doubt think so as not only is their an albeit unused model of this child in the code of little nightmares 2 called child05, whereas all six models have her name in their title. this model is identical to the child in white from vln  white tank top, white shorts, straight black hair with straight bangs. it's distinct from six's model. and this could explain why six only gets the raincoat midway into the pale city. who's to say if the raincoat even belonged to the girl with the braid if it was in the chest? it seems like this little yellow raincoat has been passed around quite a bit. and nothing but misfortune follows."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,scene selection 000  intro 059  the sound of nightmares the story explained 649  explaining the world of little nightmares 1158  the six connection 1252  outro
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i just want to say... i loved 'the sounds of nightmares', and to hear that episode six was the last while i was listening at work had me a little upset. i want more, so dang badly! it was delightfully dark, and i was expecting to have a couple more to look forward to. you did an incredible job writing for those episodes, and i really hope bandai namco does more like this, and taps you again!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i was not expecting this video. i didn't think we'd have enough information for a while
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"hey, man. thank you for suggesting the the sound of nightmares series. it's really great and congratulations on helping in an episode"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,the podcast gives off some lovecraftian vibes and i think it works quite well with the world of little nightmares.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i really hope we get to learn more about why 6 betrayed mono in the feature little nightmares game. there are so many good theorys out there but i wanna know the cannon one edit guys i appreciate the time you put to explain what the fandom thinks but i know every single one of them. i just want to know the canon reason
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"i really like how the creators didn't do a copout world building where everything is actually just a nightmare. instead, they chose to go for the approach that the nowhere is actually a real place to some extent. i think that is much more interesting. i have yet to see how the maw and the signal tower play into it all."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"just casually explained why the series is called little nightmares. its children being transferred to the nowhere, thinking its their nightmares. their little nightmares"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i think c.c. may be the very little nightmares protagonist. in chapter 6 when noone comes across the yellow raincoat, otto reacts as if he recognizes it. since the girl in very little nightmares was the original owner of the raincoat, and otto seems to recognize it, that could point to her actually being c.c."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i don't know if six is otto's sister. many people have theorized that cici may be the protagonist from very little nightmares, because while six did have the raincoat, she wasn't the first one to have it. she had gotten it from the girl with the braided hair who was killed by the little girl antagonist at the end when they both fell in the water. if that was cici, then otto will be crushed when he finds out she's no longer alive... but if cici is six... then he may be in for a surprise when he heard about what happened with mono and the maw..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i had no idea this was a thing but its very nice to finally have some semblance of actual plot for this world
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i'm so incredibly happy that they didn't make the dream theory true. that was my one worry with the podcast series, and it seems pretty clear that its not the case. i mean it has to do with dreams obviously, but its not exclusively a dream."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i definitely don't think otto is the doctor, there aren't really any threads connecting them besides their roll as people who are supposed to help. the doctor is a cosmetic surgeon, while the counselor is a psychiatric sort."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i kinda feel that sisi could be the girl in the yellow raincoat because otto seemed interested when noone said she saw a raincoat which could be hinting that his sister could of worn a raincoat a lot or something similar since he does say yellow when noone mentioned it and the girl in the yellow raincoat is the only character besides six that we've seen wear a raincoat
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i am so glad this franchise is continuing. not only that, theyve already answered a lot of our questions before the games even released, in a god way. everything makes so much more sense now."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i didn't realise six's theme playing when otto asked about the yellow raincoat, however i thought the yellow raincoat would link closer to the protagonist in very little nightmares as she had the coat before six, and would've took it to the nowhere. six did not get this coat till she reached the pale city. unless six is the same person as the yellow raincoat girl."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i love little nightmares so much. im obsessed, the ost is amazing, the experience is awesome, everything is just outstanding. the story is insanely good as well, and i cant wait for ln3!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"230 this is the point i am currently on, and i was immediately reminded of a little nightmares aufancomic where the world literally was a nightmare, but all the kids involved were having it at the same time and were basically all presently in the world along with the other kids. so six befriended and dropped mono through the nightmare, but they found each other irl and were able to talk and communicate over it. the nightmare world was an obvious relflection of the real world the easily breakable bullies and the teacher that sees all, the disturbed doctor that can seemingly get everywhere, the escapeobsessed townsfolk, and there were other aspects like six's mom being the lady, and they live on a boat and she works at a restaraunt with the chefs. it's not finished but it's a favorite of mine, and i have a feeling that's the direction this video is going."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"640 the thing with otto sounds like the guy from fran bow who was experimenting on children to get to another realm. though unlike the antagonist from fran bow, otto just wants to find his sister though obviously going about it in a bad way, but that's madness for you."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-24,little nightmares is how i discovered you so it makes me happy that youre covering this 2 years later
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,the sounds of nightmares is fantastic. great addition to the lore of the series.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"man, you did a great job on the epsodes of the podcasts, they're amazing"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,im so happy to see little nightmares on the channel! ive been keeping up with the sound of nightmares and i cant wait for the third game!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,sisi could also be the girl in the yellow raincoat from very little nightmares. since we see six getting her signature raincoat later on in the games after the death of the girl in the yellow raincoat
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,this would make sense as to why little nightmares takes place in the world we play it in. along with the fact that every child look like they have been through so much. it is a twisted safe place that the ferryman takes them to be free of the 'monsters' that harmed them
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"a couple things i'd like to point out 1. i also thought six was otto's sister due to his reaction to ruth mentioning the yellow raincoat, but then i remembered that six wasn't the first girl to wear that raincoat, but rather the raincoat girl, aka nine, from very little nightmares. both wore a yellow raincoat and both have a habit of abandoning their friends. granted it's more likely they mean to imply six, because i'm assuming fewer people are familiar with vln then they are with the main games, but the writers have thrown us curveballs before, so who knows? 2. i believe it is more likely spelled cece' because it is a latin word for blind. i feel this is noteworthy because 90 of the children of little nightmares have their eyes obstructed by one thing or another the two exceptions that come to mind being the lollipop kid and the hospital girl."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i'm still holding out hope that mono will be saved.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-03,"this was useful to get everything i missee summarized and explained, love how the little nightmares universe now have a clear explanation"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"i think it makes more sence that cici is supposed to be the raincoat girl from vln, not six. otto reacts to the yellow raincoat, but six didn't have that until way later. the raincoat girl did. the maw is said to appear at a set time every year. so i think that time in the nowhere is linear, but flows differently."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"ngl i like the idea of the world of little nightmares being the real world being warped and changed, it has that cosmic horror feel where the world is gone and corrupted. which is what i thought the story of little nightmares was before, a world that used to be normal but became corrupted and warped by things like the tower. im not sure if i like little nightmares having the games be an alternate dimensions visited in dreams."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i see all of this to be true. but we also have to remember that six never had a yellow raincoat from the start story wise very little nightmares is a prequel to both ln 1 and 2, and six appeared at that game but she only wore white clothing, the girl in the yellow raincoat is the one who had the yellow raincoat until she dies at the end, so it's most likely that the girl in the yellow raincoat is actually cece, and not six. but that is only my hypothesis."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"there is definitely a connection between otto and six, as he reacted noticeably to the mention of a yellow raincoat. although that seems a little odd as six gets her coat from mono"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"the ferryman... boats always symbolised passages between worlds life to death, awaken to dream,... but i have a question why sissi joined the nowhere in the first place and what's the link with the parasite and the cure? nowhere i always loved that word x you can cut it as no where , in no place but if you cut it as nowhere... i don't know how it works in english but in my native tongue french ici et maintenant it is an expression meaning the present moment, the present action..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,the world of little nightmares being a parallel dimension that abducts children from the real world is a theory i've had for a while! it's awesome to see that's true!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-25,"i'm just happy the franchise is continuing. i thought for sure it was done after the second game. the fact they're expanding even further makes this dark fantasy series all the more interesting. i'm also glad my theory that the monsters in the game being former adults is kinda confirmed. with them being much darker and sinister representations of adulthood, it actually makes things better."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"maybe hospital tvs and experiments on children with them in little nightmares 2 concept art could also be representation of otto's experiments on children to make them enter the nightmare realm. i also have a little theory about otto what if he's the guy that talks about nightmares in little nightmares 2 trailer video? edit the sound of nightmares is really amazing addition to little nightmares universe, but it still leaves a lot of unanswered questions like what is the eye monster and signal tower actually, or time loop with mono and six in general."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,the sound of nightmares has really helped fill in a lot of gaps
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-07,hard to believe how far this game has come. i remember back when we had absolutely no clue what was happening
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"what a finale, let's hope we will see otto in a future game or podcast."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i absolutely love little nightmares. it's so cool, i like the perspective of you playing as a little kid in a scary almost bedtime nightmare world. absolutely love little nightmares so much."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"question for y'all while we scroll through the comments if the ferryman is taking children to help them misguided help but still, why are there harmful monsters in the nowhere? if he wants to help, why not take the children somewhere without monsters? a. the monsters are a product of the children's fear so they manifest themselves in this world of nightmares, since the world literally feeds off of them. the ferryman doesn't choose if the monsters exist or not, since they are just part of this realm, but he does take the willing children away from their home world and bodies b. he's just the gatherer of children for this world as they come in, he doesn't choose who comes in. it's just his role in this world c. he takes away the kids pain on purpose in order to lure them towards the nowhere"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i dont think i've ever been so invested in a game's lore in my life.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,okay let's hear it edit so after watching this i gotta agree that most of this does make sense. having these normal looking kids being in a world of distortion and monsters can mean that they were brought there with or without their say. with the questionable intentions of the ferry man like he must think he's helping them out because it seems he only takes kids with trauma or are in pain so leaving all the behind and bringing them into a world that basically is that in a whole but doesn't effect them if that makes sense . and what you said about gaining powers or being pulled by the darkness. i feel like it would matter of how that person's attitude changes the way you get powers in the dark world depending on being brave and wanting to help or a desire for power to get what you want. i'm just shooting things out there but whoever read this thanks
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i had my doubts about little nightmares lore when i first started getting into it but its only a very impressive story
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i was excited for breakdowns of this series but i didnt expect it this quick
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,push for a animated series everyone!!! this is wayyy too good
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"another theory in the sixth episode noone talks about a very elegant lady taking care of toys, is this the lady? is she, like the ferryman, a type of caretaker? noone says that she would be stitched back up, made whole again if the lady picks her up. soon after, she meets the ferryman where she's in a body that doesn't physically hurt and none of her tormentors are there. based on this, i think they may work together, or have similar goals or powers"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"it made sense now why the children appeared to be smaller than the residents of the little nightmare world, almost like a doll, and why they clearly don't seem to belong in that world. they truly don't and if strong trauma is the reason they got transported into the nowhere, then this truly made the story of little nightmare more sadder. i wonder what sort of trauma that six faced that got her into the nowhere"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i think that otto's sister might be the raincoat girl from the mobile game. why do i think this? no clue haha, but i remember in one of the chapters they brought up a yellow raincoat and we know from ln2 that that yellow raincoat did not belong to six, it belonged to raincoat girl. then again, raincoat girl may have gotten it from someone else, however we don't know that."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i hope one day this game gets its own movie
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"also, when noone was describing the yellow raincoat, otto interjected yellow?! in the background, as though one his sister used to wear. i think she is sisi, and i believe otto is mono. the games show that one can exist in the timeline as two separate beings...mono actually fighting the thin man. the stories kept referring to a purple suit and otto's machine made the staticy noise that the tvs made when mono tuned them with his power. i think six and mono had forgotten their previous life in the counties, but somewhere along the way in their adventure, likely right after their own boss battle, six with her own power was able to realize otto was mono, and that as an adult he was luring children into the nowhere, and when the chance was permitted to her, she dropped him into that pit. just a theory...."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i discovered your channel thanks to little nightmares and im glad youre the one that makes me remember that it exists and who tells me that the 3rd game is coming out. i really thank you horrorbro
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-19,"this really blowed my mind..i have to hear the sounds of little nightmares....but, based on your theory..i think cici is the girl in the yellow raincoat fromm very little nightmares..whereas, noone could be six..a lot of things you mentioned seemed to point out that noone is six..noone has water sickness..so, i think this water sickness is what causing six to have hunger issues which she feels twisting her internal organs which i got to know from ln wiki..noone also experienced bullies at school which she similarly faced in little nightmares 2..and noone is also a timid girl and a loner..which proves why six seems to end up alone in every ln games so far..this is just my theory"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-27,"superhorrorbro, this is amazing! i subscribed right away!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,so amazing mike i remember watching your little nightmares two videos all the way back in 2021 because i had no idea what was going on and now were all the way in 2023 and im all grown up i was 12 when ln2 came out and now im 15 its crazy how time flys by that quick little nightmares are always hold a special place in my heart cant wait for the ln3 theorys
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-16,this is probably my favorite lore for a horror game its just perfect
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"my theory is that six has no connection with otto. six is not ottos sister. noone saw the yellow raincoat and i think that raincoat was later worn by the girl in very little nightmares and after she drowned, six wore it. this considering if the new ppl in charge of little nightmares take very little nightmares as part of the plot ofc"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-28,"this is so cool. ever since i experienced my trauma i have had extremely vivid dreams where i can feel, taste and smell. i really love this lore"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-23,"also, i feel that it is important to point out that six is not the original owner of the yellow rain coat, so otto's sister sisi is most likely the girl we play as in very little nightmares, not six."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i have been excited for you to post, i have been checking you're channel a lot"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,keep on pumping these little nightmares theories and videos!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-22,"i have played little nightmare 1 and 2 so many times and i never knew about this, keep it up superhorrorbro!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,whenever i see a little nightmares notification i press faster tha mike can say hey guys superhorrorbro mike here!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-27,i just want to say thank you for writing some of the best podcast episodes!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,low so six dumped you ? mono yupyes she did..
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-17,"superhorrorbro, this made me laugh so much! thanks for sharing!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"a possible reason why the children are able to use certain powers after a while may be linked to the fact that children adept to foreign environments also it's possible that their powers are interlinked with their traumas. if the adults of the county have a way to cross as wellvia. death or disappearing that would explain the behaviour and looks of the monsters. example the hunter..... hides it's faceanti social, lived alone, hunts but has no wild gameso he hunts humans instead, lost his family or misses themmade replacements, lost a childkeeps ones he finds save, had a hobby to indulge in and hunts down and peppers anyone who startles or gets close to himmaby his trauma..........."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-21,"finally, the story makes much more sense"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i feel somewhat nostalgic when i see anything little nightmares
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"you missed one thing. cici isnt six, shes the girl in the rain coat, from very little nightmares. six didnt get the coat till after she was in the nowhere, and assuming its the same coat, she finds it in the pale city long after cici dies falling off a cliff. in very little nightmares, six is seen dressed as she is in the beginning of little nightmares 2, in a white nightgown. the player controls a girl in a yellow rain coat until she dies at the end and the rain coat is seen drifting in the water."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-23,"what i found the most interesting in the sound of nightmares was when otto realized that noone left him on her own will, and he had a thought that maybe sisi, his older sister left him intentionally too. after that he said something along the lines of no, that can't be, sisi leaving me? she would never. and from the earlier yellow raincoat detail that was in the 6th episode, i too think that sisi is six. this is complete speculation, but sisisix leaving otto who loved her and can't believe she did that? idk about you guys but that sounds hella familiar to me, think of it what you will..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"it's been a second since i saw you do a theory, awesome to see one again!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-22,"so the ferryman's just trying to create a safeplace for these traumatized children, however, the adults of the counties have torn this haven apart and deranged into monsters."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-11,"i was waiting for this, because i kept on falling asleep when i listen to the podcast like damn otto's voice is so calming"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,this is just crazy to hear man. so basically the fairy man thinks he's helping children by taking them from the real world into the nowhere to save them. and by doing so the nowhere is corrupting them turning them into monsters that six and mono have had to fight against. that's pretty incredible to hear man.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,yes yessss i just listened to the podcast thank you so much ive been waiting so long for this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,i feel a little bad for otto he obviously went through a lot it doesnt excuse the abuse but at least explains it
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"i was waiting for you to make a video explaining the podcast, so i'm really happy! this is amazing and makes so much sense"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,i love the idea that the monsters we run from in little nightmares are adults who were cruel to children in the working world. take the teacher in little nightmares 2 for example she was probably a really strict teacher in the counties and would punish the kids in her care severely also her ability to stretch her neck might be because she would turn her head towards the troublemaker in her class. and would try and seek them out hence why in the game she is seen looking for mono.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,man. i love the music you use for your videos. i started preferring your channel thanks to them.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"it may be more likely that the girl otto referred too as his sister was not six, but rather the girl in the yellow raincoat, since we now know six only aquired the raincoat after the girl in the raincoat died in very little nightmares, i believe they also mentioned something about red ribbons? which would further the idea that it is indeed the girl in the yellow raincoat."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-19,"924 with this in mind, i think that the lady in little nightmares 1 is noone. think about it, only kids in the realm are able to get powers. so how would the lady get her powers despite her being an adult."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,keep up the good work!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"cant wait for the new game. love my feral little children. i do think cc might of been the girl in the raincoat. maybe thats why the music box is so dear to six, reminds her of the girl she stole the raincoat from, a drive to keep going thats how she escaped the nest. it does make it kinda sad though on the ferrymans part. he wants to give children the opportunity to fight back against their oppressors yet you have kids like the pretender who also harms kids."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,314 i feel sorry for her! especially because after dealing with bullies and the life threatening water parasite! and now she's doing headaches and terrible nightmares!it's very rude to call names like nobody! ruth is somebody not a nobody! what a jerk those bullies are! i have to admit i feel like i'm staring to see demons rather than a human being! that's how i see bullies they are demons in this world to me!422 wait she disappeared and later reappeared on the bed she sleeps!?i know we do dream every night we just either don't remember them and wake up just fine! or you experienced a dream or a nightmare! but i'm sure none of those three options doesn't make the person disappear in a later return to where they were sleeping! i mean i know this is a little nightmare logic i'm talking about!1100 talking about nightmares reminded me of my nightmare experience!i remembered when i was a little girl i saw two images! one is a shadow show of a plane crashing with its explosions and a lot of smoke and the other the aftermath of the plane completely destroyed i was in the sky when i was looking at a forest and it felt so real and seeing a destroyed plane in the forest! but that was a long time ago! 1125 i see that as a justifiable act! as well that's his punishment for tormenting the poor and innocent children! that's the price for not listening to the ferryman's warning! abusers like that jerk deserve the worst punishment possible like a death sentence! right?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,i am so exited for more of my favorite horror universe
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,"i just rewatched little nightmares ii, what a timing"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-15,"to a counselor named otto as a honkai fan, the minute i heard otto, i knew something was wrong"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,also to keep in mind the doctor had a patient he somewhat cares about the one with the heart monitor what if this was a representation of otto's sister and confirms that the doctor is otto and considering he exprimented and tormented so many in little nightmares 2 as well
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-15,i love the story of this game even more now. genius.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-16,"two things i noticed 1. throughout the second game, six is always faster than mono. this is important because if mono were faster or they ran at the same speed, the ending wouldnt play out the same. 2. the chair grows with mono. some higher power is keeping mono in the tower. maybe mono isnt the manipulator, but instead the puppet."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,"what always gets me is that breaking monos loop would be impossible. the thin man goes after six and warps her out of revenge, something he was only able to do because mono let him out. six had tried to stop him but neither of them could reasonably guess what the consequences were and so she lets it go and then lets him go when she sees his face and recognizes it. that action leading mono to go after her in the first place"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"345 six's theme from the first game is a lot more vocal heavy, like someone is humming the tune, and then from ln2, the theme is extremely music box heavy with less vocals, which would make a lot of sense, cause six actually has the music box playing the tune in ln2, whereas in the first game, she's literally having to hum the tune herself because the music box is no longer in her possession we see it kinda destroyed in the end of ln2, so, uh, yea, that box ain't working anymore. i love that subtle storytelling. it's so good."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,little nightmares is like a studio ghibli movie if you turn off the lights and add a few monsters in every corner
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-19,"i also noticed that after the intense train chase sequence with the thin man and the train crashes, mono can be seen holding his hand on his torso in pain, the thin man does this exact same movement when he appears after mono climbs up the ladder and confronts him!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"honestly, i just hope that the thin man returns in some way shape or form. he's just way too cool of a character to only have 5 minutes screen time in a single level in a single game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"if i had a nickel for every time a child got dropped of a cliff in the little nightmares franchise i'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird it happened twice."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"1029 dude this detail blew my mind. i was actually not expecting more foreshadowing of mono being thin man. thin man standing behind mono on the the front cover and even his head perfectly being symmetrical with the top of the signal tower representing monos bad was already good enough. but this little detail actually added the finishing touches, i never ever even noticed that. once again just like last video i was not expecting to learn new stuff 3 whole years later. this is bringing me back to when i knew nothing and was just learning about little nightmaress world. bringing new questions and details like this to light is very fun. thank you tericho."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"i think that the clothes dont just represent them being sucked into the tvs but moreso them being consumed by the city itself. the theory about the nowhere is really interesting. it makes sense that only children are allowed because usually its children that have nightmares and they belive them. as for why the people want to eat the children, maybe its like an aot thing where you have to eat the children to get back to the real world."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"i love how mono's character twist was right there in his name mono. as in, mono television."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-16,"at least we found out why six is always hungry. her shadow or soul is missing so she eats others to fill the void. so she already had powers similar to the lady already but her's were more barbaric or unharnessed n she had to physically eatabsorb others but, after absorbing the lady, she no longer has to physically absorb others she just has to have the intent and she can absorb the weaker souls. she was definitely on her cell n majin boo tip at first. it makes me think that she was probably hidden away because she had the potential to be like the lady all along. all we're seeing is that this alternative world is our own with no hero's or villains."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-24,"i like to think of six's journey a little different she starts off weak and powerless on her journey but when she leaves mono, and so the thin man behind, you see shadow six for the first time, a kind of phantom of power she gains after she realized she can escape the threat which is also being strengthened by her returning from her monster form she realizes she has power for the first time and basically got cleansed of her innocence by the signal. she has changed from that point on and when she's in the maw, she's a completely different child now with a mission that mission is power. think about it she gained the ability to absorb knowledge and abilities by eating and now has a dark phantom that kind of drives her on and throughout the game she escapes and kills different threats, ending her streak with the lady. she then escapes the maw with new powers she gained and goes out into the rest of the nightmare world but now with the ability to neutralize these threats. she is now on an eternal quest for power after having avoided the thin man and killed the lady. that's why i think we aren't getting a continuation of six's story it would be a completely different game where you go around shamelessly taking the lives of the most powerful threats in the nowhere. you'd be playing as six but with control over the nightmare. she is now getting revenge on everything, driven by her dark phantom and built up anger from the real world. she's getting revenge on everything wrong with her normal life by taking control of her nightmare. leaving this little theory here so this can possibly be expanded upon."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-17,"heres a theory i had when asked if mono was the thin man seen in game, or simply a predecessor to a previous thin man, the devs said both options were correct. this confirms that there was a thin man existing before mono grew up to be the one we see in game. we see them in the comics, about to crawl out of a screen and kidnap a child. this cant be mono, as he remained locked up, until his past self opened the door and freed him ill touch on this later. so what happened to this past thin man? well, i believe they tried attacking mono, only to get killed in the process. look at the last issue of the comics, and view it from the lense of the monster being a thin man. mono is surrounded in a burning building by unmoving, glitched remains. not only are the children pitch black, but they are stuck and forced into awkward positions, like the ones we see in the game. mono runs from the thin man and hides away within a broken television, as the last panel reveals the monsters silhouette. they dont show his face because wed recognize it, and there would be no mystery. we know this for a fact because if you break the page and peer up, you can see the thin mans body model  they traced it verbatim due to budget constraints. from there, i believe mono gets lucky and somehow kills it, absorbing its powers. this aligns with how six absorbs the ladys powers after killing them, and explains why mono gets a sudden power upgrade after killing his future self in game. as for why i think the comics tm isnt monos future self time traveling, the timeline simply doesnt add up. there are multiple types of time loops. monos is a stable time loop, or in other words, one that cannot be broken. this loop doesnt technically repeat, not even twice. it only happens once and is forever set in stone afterwards. the little nightmares twitter has confirmed as such. a future mono would have no reason nor no motive to go as far back as seen in the comics. the one in the comics has to be different."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-18,the feedback between thin man and mono was a very clever detail. i was aware of the noise but didnt register it as being feedback
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,if mono doesnt want to be alone could that be why people are pulled through the tv in a desperate attempt to have someone there and not be alone perhaps thats why six had her own room in the tower when it seemed no one else was there mono was abandoned by six yet later in his life he was still so desperate to get her back and seemingly tried to make her comfortable by giving her the music box in a cruel twist of fate he still cares for his friend
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"ayo whta if mono has powers over tvs because the death of his parents or a hunter who killed them was lied about and twisted in the news and he wished he could have influence to make them stop or change the story of what happened? in a way, many horror aspects of nightmares stem down to a fear of not having control or agency. i wouldn't be suprised if this affected the series in mono getting a superpower having agency beyond realistic grasp over something that somehow spins itself onto its head to become an extra source of agony in the nightmare. there is an element of torment in a nightmare to get the illusion of agency in it but that illusion or element somehow making your situation worse. for example, if i am having a nightmare and acknowledge that it is a nightmare and not real, any characters that are trying to hurt me only get more upset at me for it. what if that is what is happening with mono's nightmare in a way where his nightmare punishes him harder for trying to have agency?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"theres a problem with the thin man with the thin man being trapped in the signal tower there are glitched children everywhere, implying that he was kidnapping children from the start. i think that having mono open the door was only a way to find where mono was"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"something that confuses me, and a theory  if areas are based off of nightmares of kids, do all children in those areas have part in the creation? cuz theres a lot of kids in the pale city. also, who dreamt up the maw? its all really weird  what if sixs goal is to find that eye creature and kill it? literally killing god. maybe she knows whats going on after her time in the signal tower, and she wants to end it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,idr exactly where i heard this from but it was probably superhorrorbro who said in one of his videos that the ferryman had a dialogue that said something along the lines that if otto continues doing what he's doing then he might soon be able to enter the nightmare world as one of the adults. so i don't really think that all the adults in the series are fake or a figment of the kids' nightmares
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,115 i dont known why but that 3rd hand scared the crap out of me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-17,"i have 2 hypotheses 1 mono is still alive and will return at some point in the future...for six 2 six is looking for powers to take on the eye. that's why shadow six points her to the maw. the twist is that shadow six is being controlled by mono, looking for a way to escape the loop."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"ah yes finally, a little nightmares theory!, i've been missing this series and rewatching everything"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,"347 six's theme sounds like a few young girls like, 812 are humming it to soothe themselves after witnessing something scary while the main theme feels like the ambiance the first meaning of the maw come to sound. almost like it's an alive thing luring you into a false sense of security while you're in the belly of the beast.."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-04,"here's what i think happened six, in the very first timeline, may have been taken by another entity and trapped with the music box, which became her safe haven. when mono broke into her chamber and destroyed the door to meet her for the first time, he might have disrupted her peaceful isolation. this could explain her initial hesitation to trust him, her reluctance to hold his hand, and her eventual betrayal. the destruction of the music box later in the story mirrors this, further fueling her resentment. in the loop, the thin man replaces the original captor, symbolizing mono's future self trying to communicate that six is already content and doesnt need saving. he traps her with the music box, intending it as a safe haven to break the cycle and prevent mono from intervening. however, mono misinterprets this and destroys the music box again, taking away her solace and perpetuating the cycle. when six leaves the tv, its symbolic of her distancing herself from mono rather than breaking free from the loop itself. the tv represents mono's entrapmenthis mind, his psychological struggle, and his cycle of repeatedly trying to save her. six was never really tied to the loop in the way mono was the loop exists within his mind. by stepping away from the tv, she isn't escaping the loop but instead choosing to leave mono behind, since he hurt her by destroying her music box her safe haven. it could be that mono has a hero complex that pushes him to keep saving her even though she doesn't really want that which makes her even more hurt and betrayed"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,wait... mono means 'singularalone'... one of the kids in ln3 is called alone... i'm sensing a connection!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,"it's a bit like coraline. the other mother lured the unfortunate children into her world, creating a semblance of reality based on the lives of children, but could never make it real enough."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"otto isn't a completely evil character. his obsession with rescuing his sister is a noble one, but he lost sight of the fact that he's doing harm to other children to pursue that goal, and is thus failing his duty as a doctor to help his patients...it's too bad he hasn't realized that he's turning into a villain in time to stop."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-16,"just wanted to point out 2 things. the first is that noone is actually noone. no one keeps going no where. the second is a detail that i hadn't really noticed and then started digging through old videos to confirm and found it kinda baffling which is this. in both little nightmares 1  2 there are no eyes other than the eye. every creature has hollow sockets or folds hiding their eyes or closed eyelids. every main character has a mask or a hood or something that hides their face and there eyes so we never actually see them. every enemy, even the geisha at the end of the first game doesn't have any eyes to see just black voids in her mask where they should be. the only times we ever see anything eye shaped in the entire franchise is when it is referencing the eye and when the amalgamation of the viewers is chasing mono. otherwise noeyes."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-18,"i still think six is a hero. she's trying to bring the nowhere down after what was done to her. she understands aspects of it that no one else caught up in it does. however much it has marked or corrupted her, she wants to end all of it. after her experience discovering what was to become of her friend and letting him go, she sets her sights not on the regular citizens of the pale city, but on the fat and opulence of the maw. she's a dark hero."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-09,"028 omg thats what hes chopping up? i wonder do they let the guests gorge themselves into a food coma, and chop them up while theyre sleeping?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,"one thing i would like to point out is the bits of irony in ln3 protagonists names. low has a mask that resembles a plague doctor's, but also a birds head. birds, known for flight. additionally, he has a bow, a long ranged weapon we see him use to interact with objects higher than he can reach. meanwhile alone is shown reaching up to help low in multiple trailers, so she isn't seeking out solitude, and most definitely isn't alone, since she travels with him."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-03,"another possible theory after hearing about noone is that the audio is a prequel to everything. because of the doctor or some other inciting incident, the nowhere seeps out into the real world, twisting and deforming it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"one thing i mever hear mentioned in these kind of videos is that there is a clear system in the nowhere. one photo in the lady's quarters is a giant warlus hunted in an artic ambience, and in the first series of comics, the one with the northwind, we see a village of fully grown adults but not monstrous. one of the kids even said that he and his sister were from there and had a culture of amulets for the childrens. maybe they were kids that escape the tower influence and they just grow up, having fear of the nowhere."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"i think other theorists said six is not necessarily the main character, but her raincoat was meant to symbolize the start of something, but is now also the end of it, whatever it is."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,six is fading from this world and her only hope is to guide mono to the signal tower i always took this game description as six was always using mono as a sacrifice to save herself. she just needed the right moment. i think six needs to absorb ppls powers andor life force as substance. 1st mono and then lady on the maw. maybe she only realizes when her shadow self appears after her kidnapping. so she absorbs his powers and let him fall. or shes know all along she needs the power of the signal tower and others to not fade away.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"i find it kinda weird, that little nightmares 3 apparently has nothin to do with six. the sounds of nightmares do not either and can be preparing. but the comics, for a part, had nothing to do with six, too, but little nightmares 2 was still about her. so, we can't be completely sure, there is no hint of six in little nightmares 3. perhaps we see here, how six was captured to go into the nest. there was a overall theme in little nightmares 1 hunger and little nightmares 2 escapism. but what overall theme will there be in little nightmares 3? perhaps death? the necropolis hints to that. but the carnival doesn't. so, i don't know. speaking of the carnival from the teaser. there is a weird shot of th people there, which is kinda upside down. how does that come to be?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-22,"mono is also one of two ways how audio signal can be mixed. mono is one channel only and it gives the impression that the sound is coming from one direction only. while stereo has two channels, one left and one right, giving the impression of coming from two different directions."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-27,"i enjoy the title little nightmares but i also could see why the series could be called hunger in this game as well.. the main theme so far has been overindulgence in some way, and technically, if six is on some kind of mission, it shows how she has overindulged this world to reach her goal.. love it. thanks for the vid!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,716 talk about one hell of a pun
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,i think shadow six might b the real villian slowly corrupting six over time
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"i have a weird theory, so hear me out if ln2 is prequel of ln1, then whyy do we see thin man in tv at the end of ln? and if u would notice, the backdrop is quite different, like a white fuzzy sort of. so, what if monothin man found a way to end the loop or perhaps someone other than mono opened the door?! i think it's either low and alone or its otto from soln! well, if we consider events of soln taking place parallel to ln2, it's quite possible. so, what if otto was transported to nowhere and he found a way to free mono. or its someone we don't know yet. what u all think?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-17,"i think six didn't betray mono. i think the time paradox cannot be broken, and mono happened to almost break it. six realized this  so she deliberately grabs mono's hand even if mono could have made the jump, and dropped him. kinda like in avenger's endgame, how timeline cannot be altered by modifying the past, mono is always trapped in that eternal time paradox. mono escaping that signal tower would mean destruction of spacetime or something. so i think in all iterations of the time loop, mono is bound to be caught by the fleshy tower. but this time, he happens to almost escape. six prevents that to keep balance in spacetime, and hopefully will come back stronger to save mono from his ill fate. six must've seen this in her monster form. ps maybe time didn't pass and mono didn't age. organic matter and people tend to stretch out. mono got stretched out the same way as six did, just not so grotesquely."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,"why nobody talking about the fact that none of the children ever feel hunger because it's a dream, besides six as soon as she killed or thought she killed mono. maybe there's a contract with the eye monster where feeding children to it gets u closer to reality, and escaping the dream? it's my first theory ever so it's probably a stupid idea."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-05,what happened to mono wheres my family? well me and my pa went hunting and mistook them for deer.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-27,"something i thought of, is that if the nowhere is made from the imagination of children, what about the children that lucid dream? lucid dreams can play out a nightmares, but the child is in control of what happens in it, and most of the time, they use the power of a lucid dream to give themselves and advantage in the nightmare against the monsters. so what if in little nightmares 3, low and alone get their weapons from a short lucid dream they both had in the nowhere? just a thought i had, it probably isn't true because ln3 isn't out yet."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-03,"maybe mono has a television addiction and six has an eating disorder, and the nightmare world reflects that."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-16,"i love little nightmares, a little theory i have, but i can't seem to recall the actual term for it. the allseeing eye that appears to be watching all our main characters, it's a cosmic being, a eldritch monstrosity we can't comprehend. in order for it to grow or do whatever, it needs to be witnessed, heard and believed in to became a reality. i forgot the name of the theory for it... but the allseeing eye needs impressionable and innocent minds like six runaway kid, mono and noone's to feed off of and gain more power over the real waking world. that's it. i wonder if it's possible for mono to break his time paradox in little nightmares 3 dlc?"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-28,i remember subscribing to u when my friend sent me a link of one of your outlast 1 videos. after that i fell in love with your channel. best gaming channel in youtube
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,"ive always wondered, is little nightmares 1 japanese? because the ladys dress looks like those japanese dress things, i forgot what it was called tho, and the maw looks like a japanese all you can eat buffet, it kinda gives spirited away vibes."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-14,if you get to close you might never escape her dark power six
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-19,my brother loves to watch little nightmares and pretending to play it on tv
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-26,and six kissed her neck
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-12,the lady is creepy in the little nightmare she only have a power but she keep little nightmare and the chef killing on the people what you kill the people with die and the shape is two
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-04,i like the lady and mono and six
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-04,she is just a young adult woman because she is hiding her young face
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-04,thank you for compliment of your sir its time to keep myself looking perfect
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-21,"i love how they made a dlc with that gnome as the main character. i feel so bad for him, he just wanted to escape"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,and you can even see the part she lost of herself watching her whenever she eats
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,i now see why people thought six would eventually become the geisha. im so glad that bandai namco decided to continue this game series!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,"she also is scared to trust anyone again after realizing the one person she trusted mono was the thin man, so she couldnt trust the gnome helping her"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-25,"seven ate nine, but six ate seven."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-24,"if mono escaped with six, the time loop would break and they would both cease to exist."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-11,"i don't see many people talk about how kind she is when we first meet her again in the tower. she's so trusting that she not only offers to share with mono the music box and what that represents after being coaxed, but in the case that mono misses the music box when swinging the hammer and slams it into the ground next to it, she doesn't go to shield it. she doesn't even flinch. in her most animalistic form, when her body  and probably mind, too  have been contorted practically beyond recognission, she still believes mono won't hurt her. the decision to betray him happens after he hurts her in his attempt to free her and escape together. and mono, of course, had to save her. he cares about her. why would he not? judgement cannot be passed to him. he did what he did out of love for the friend who has been there throughout this whole nightmare. these are children. children who have absolutely no guidance trying to survive in a hateful world of severe and disgusting cruelty. it's hard to ask a five year old to make logical decisions about who to risk trusting when they've been hurt so unbelievably much both mentally and physically throughout their entire life. i don't believe this story is one of villains and heroes. it's a tragedy about the perils of childhood and what can be lost to it. it's hard for me to look at any of the children in this franchise even the school children, honestly and see true evil. the only evil that can be found comes from the hundreds or even thousands of adults who would rather escape from reality than fix the world when they have all the power now that they likely lacked as children."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-11,"little nightmares 2 made me really sad about both six and mono tbh, future mono just wanted to prevent the betrayal happening to him that would lead him to that state, but at the same time it would result in six doing these as well, which is a vicious chain that can't be broken. i wonder how little nightmares 3 will be"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-30,six gains the memorys of whoever she eats. the nome is they boy from the dlc who already knew where the ladys residence was. when six ate the nome she then knew where to find the lady
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-22,when she eat she absorbed the memories and the skills. when she eat the rat she learn how use sewers. when she eat gnome she learn the mirror was the weapon. when she eat the lady she got her power
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-18,"certainly a good example of a child who is ostracized by the village, will burn it down to feel its warmth."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-12,i have read the theory that she unintentionally let go of mono's hand because felt the urge to eat him and got scared. she would have attacked mono if she didn't let him go
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-08,"man, if shadow six is basically six's soul then it would make so much sense that she would just let mono fall, in fiction people who lost their souls are always portraited as people who are barely or not capable of feeling emotions, so what thin man took from her was probably her capacity to feel empathy for others, which is why she left mono."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-02,"this also happens a while after the kitchen, meaning she probably realised the sausage was made out of other children, so the gnome was better in her mind because she didnt know it was actually another child."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-18,i remember someone brought up a point that monothe mans feelings towards six are pretty ambiguous since when he grabbed her the man turned six into a monster but also left her in a room filled with comfort items like her music box and stuff so it could be he resents her but understands on some level what she did
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-13,i figured she didnt want the sausage because by that point we knew it was made of kids
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-19,"spoiler for the final boss fight of little nightmares 2 the saddest thing to me is the boss fight with her in little nightmares 2. you have to destroy her music box, which was something that she was using when you initially find her as a coping device. and in order to get to that music box, you have to use the call command, which was a tool that you used to get her to follow you as a sign of her trust to you. essentially, you have to constantly betray her trust in order to save her. and then afterwards, when she comes back to normal mono, doesnt get the chance to explain himself before everything starts closing on itself. so whether or not, she knows that mono eventually becomes the thin man is irrelevant. they are both essentially trapped in a time loop cycle of revenge against each other."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-20,im hungry. absorts the freaking life out of you cutely at this point mono can use six as a weapon. mono face the power of the demon child!! hyeaghhhhhh!!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-30,i like the theory of her realizing that the meat on the maw is made of children and chose to eat the to her weird looking animal instead of human sausage.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-15,"plus, throughout the entire first game, it's very obvious that the monsters are killing kids, turning them into food such as sausages, and feeding them to the guests. so six knows that the sausage was made of her own kind, but she didn't know that the nome was too. so six, in an attempt to not commit cannibalism, eats the unknown creature instead of the childmeat sausage. which unfortunately, we all know how that worked out."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-12,i saw something that says six gains the abilities and knowledge of the things she eats
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-09,i attributed her hunger to her keeping the hunger from her giant version
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,"mano and six are monsters and it's a never ending cycle. no start, no end."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-14,"the poor gnome just wanted to give her food ,always breaks my heart"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-15,it also kind of makes sense when your are being chased by mono but the tall version he takes six and leaves because he wants to keep her trapped and chases mono to not let him free her and have to experience the pain that the tall mono had to suffer
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-01,and then you realize that the gnome she ate is the kid you play as in the dlc....
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-25,"i think her eating the gnome makes sense because throughout the whole game, she witnesses how the food there is made out of other children, so she couldn't bring herself to eat a fellow child. too bad for her  that gnome turns out to be a former child too."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-15,"as someone who's never had any contact with this game i must say, that's a craaazy way to start a video"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-16,off topic from the video but i cant believe the little nightmares community is still alive i love this game sm and i get so happy when i see content for it
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-01,"she took a fall into the maw, where hunger's always peaking."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-09,"possibly, but even before that her sadistic nature seemed like it was beginning to rear its ugly head. breaking fingers in the hospital, warming herself by the fire that incinerated the doctor. breaking one of the bullies heads. although some of these seemed like survival , i think these moments were beginning to show that she will do anything to survive. and once she sees mono as a threat its over."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-15,"i personally feel that its as simple as she knew what the sausages being made, and saw that they were made of kids and people, so chose to eat the gnome, which she wouldnt have known was human. and every other hunger scene she had no other options, this is why i believe that she was attempting to avoid cannibalism"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-19,"i've heard a theory about six getting the knowledge from the things she eats for example, she eats an rat and she uses hidingplaces more. and when she eats the nome who was the runaway kid from the dlc she gets the knowledge to use the mirrors against the geisha, because the runaway kid knew that hurt her. and again when she eats the geisha, she gets her powers. i always thought that made sense"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-28,i've watched eddie vr too much. when he said six i was like who the heck is six? that's shoes!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-28,"i keep seeing people suggest that six somehow knows mono is the thin man. buuuut she's still very friendly to mono in the tower until he attacks her music device, an act that clearly upsets her very much. it's only after that when she becomes hostile to him, which suggests she betrays mono because she was hurt by young mono when he tries to help her."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-07,"in the end, she didn't kill the passengers because she needed to. she definitely wanted to by then"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-15,"well, thats the thing most people dont realize six didnt end up on the maw by accident. she stowed away with the goal of getting to the geisha im sure"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-10,yup gamingbeaver explained that she takes the essence of what she eats the rat she gained its knowledge to navigate the pipes and the gnomerunaway game knew to defeat her with the mirror.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-22,another from gaming beaver theory that the world is full of endless cycle. every ending has the same fate as the main antagonist had.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-10,six took big back to another level
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-16,this music always sends a shiver down my spine...
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-11,the fact that that was the runaway kid is mental
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-19,eats relentlessly to recover a piece of her soul sounds like the hollows from bleach
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-06,the way her hand hot slammed
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,his name is thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-24,my innocence is stripping away...
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-07,"it's also a parallel i feel, to how she becomes the masked woman, who seems to be usingconsuming the banquet guests."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-22,"a headcanon i have. so we know mono is the thin man. assuming the version of the thin man we see was also betrayeddropped by six, you would assume he is angry at her and takes her into the tvtower to get back at her. but he set her up in a room with toys and a music box that brought her comfort. i think he was mad, but also sad for the time they never got to spend together as kids. mono obviously cared about her and tried to rescue her and probably saw her as a potentially good friend. being dropped and not having that time together and being alone for so long, then to have the chance at having what you missed out on, i think he wanted that and so he was trying to make her comfortable so she would open up to him. but also notice, he would be a full grown man now and he takes her when she is still a kid. so when we see her again, she's big, but still in her kid form. i could be wrong, but i feel like thats showing six's emotionally stunted growth. shes caught in between trying to grow up and make sense of things while not being able to cope and just being a kid finding solace in a music box."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-24,yeah that's not slender man that's thin man.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-11,"youre on the right track. both games take place in the mind of six ln1 and mono ln2. ln1 is a redemption story of the grown younglady six and she probably looks eerily similar to the geisha after she is defeated at the end. thats because she has a severe case of anorexia, but also suffers from severe cibophobia fear of food. lm2 is the origin story of what happened that she ended up like that. but its taken from monos perspective just before he kills himself. his suicide is what snaps the young six awake in ln1. notice the man who hung himself in the first 3 minutes of game play."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-09,i know exactly what this game is really about. the hidden meaning.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-22,when the victim started his villain arc
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-19,i didn't like that six made her friend into a monster by sacrificing him the way she did
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-29,"weird thing about six eating things is actually a lot more of a mystery then you think, like how could six know that mirrors hurt the lady, or the fact that she knew where the key was in the chef level, unless she gained the memories of the things she ate, like when she ate the rat who must have adventured through the entire area the chefs were in and because the runaway kid saw all those shattered mirrors and the fact that she hates people seeing her face, all the things six knows is all because she gained the memories of the things she ate"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-19,"it's also theorized that, like mono and the tall man, six and the geisha are the same person. it's a part of the time loop theory"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-25,crazy self improvement journey
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,little nightmares is more twisted than i thought
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-22,bro was so hungry she ate an entire submarine
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,"fun fact i played the dlc the nome that is eaten well. there is a reason there were only three dlc packs for the first game, i'm not gonna spoil but wow i'm sad for that nome"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-29,i need this to be a movie
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-24,she became five instead of six
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-24,"i mean originally i had the same thoughts and still do. but she acted kind of twisted even before she was taken by the slender looking man. however, we dont know what happened when she was kept at that house stuck in the room before mono finds her. so she may gone through even more than we know."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-24,yo yo its the slender maaaaan? and he's cooking hotdogs.... in the frying paaaaaan
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-07,the gasp i gusped when she ate him and then the absolute shock and sadness that washed over me at the end of the dlc
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-18,this made me want to do a deep lore dive into the series to and understand wtf is going on.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-25,my personal thinking is that mono hiding under the bed instead of atleast trying to help her escape the thin man with a helping hand was the point when she started to 'lose herself' and lose her trust in mono despite of him having saved her multiple times before. like from the hunter and the bullies in the school.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,this gaming series is genius
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-19,those hunger pains come to me at 4am you better not be awake while im hungry at that time
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,still my favorite game since 2019.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-23,"6 had the ability the absorb powers from other people that have abilities. every time you see her eat, it somehow helps her realize where she is. i cant remember where she was led, but she eats food near a cafeteria and then knows her way through the kitchen. she also eats a knome which shows her how to take down the geisha"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-25,all the homies hates six
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-16,i thought she was eating things because that's what the maw does to everyone inside of it
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-15,thin man signal tower
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-08,i have a idea maybe she thought that the sausage was made of a kid but the gnome was also a kid but she didnt know that
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-16,rip runaway kid
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-01,i guess that just shows how awful the tower is that it can drive people to do things like that.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-19,"there were times where you see six becoming more psychotic, she probably would have betrayed mono regardless of what happened."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-23,i think its crazy seeing mono  himself. also i feel like the constant shoes we see through the game. is him trying to change the past.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-12,the slender man is crazy
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-12,"she ate the gnome to get more vital information about where she was and how to escape, google told me that."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-10,bro said slender man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-28,our little psycho our little nightmare.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,this game will forever one of the greatest story in history of games in my opinion.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-20,i like how this game also has the first game come after the second in the story because its similar to mr hopps where it does the same thing and i think thats really interesting
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-23,replace the missing part of her soul with egg
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-31,"this scene gave me chills, i got goosebumps from this scene"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-11,finally someone that knows nightmares 2 is before nightmares 1
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-20,she gains the memory of the things she eats
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-20,"ok, so i havent ever seen little nightmares and the first thing i hear is she ate the gnome and i just about had a damn heart attack"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,also every character you play is actually a memory of their brain like where mono helped six and after that mono wakes up and realizes hes still the same
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-22,"i never ever realized ln2 was a prequel. but looking back, it does make sense."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-14,"every time she eats, you see shadow six in the corner. its ez to miss first time playing"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-15,the slender man? bro's name is the thin man....
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-14,when you realize that gnome was run away kid....
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-22,in the start of little nightmares 2 mono see six with the toy and mono breaks so because he is trying to save six and make sure she doesnt become the monsters like them but when things man grabs six he tries to end the loop that kept on going and basically at the end mono is the thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-27,she ate the nome to gain the knowledge of where to go to escape the maw
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-14,"i think the other thing is, she's growing up. she's becoming an adult and the adults eat people. she's going through puberty and becoming cannibalistic."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-27,you can see a shadow version of six watching over her whenever she feeds. on the first clip she appears on the table in the background between the glass bottles. its literally foreshadowing the ending and the nonlinear time rules in the games.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-14,"in other words, she just wanted an autoeat button"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-18,"i am so excited for little nightmares three because its two brand new characters, but i hope they have some references or at least deeper explanation to the lore.. supposedly rumor has it. theyre gonna get down a little bit more into the details of the story and were gonna find out more clues about hanging and the mall and all these other weird things came to be."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-15,notice how the next game always releases 4 years later.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-09,"the sound track, gameplay, graphics, story, all these things were perfect in ln2 they even used some little psychology to prepare us for the ending truly goat studiodevelopers"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-16,i'm just realizing it's taking him 4 years to make each one of them. i'm glad they keep the consistency.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-06,i'm so excited for ln 3
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-10,"small pattern noticed, every 4 years the game releases, im not sure if this is coincidence or just pure chance, but its pretty cool nonetheless"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-07,"as a long time ln fan, i can not express how excited i am for ln3. i was obsessed with the series when i found gameplay of the first ln game on youtube. every now and then ill check back in to see if the third game has released. ln2 was like a terrible hyperfixation for me, im quite young so i kinda had to sneak it around my parents because i didnt want them knowing how dark the shit i was into was. i played ln2 about dozens of times on xbox. years later im still creeped out by the signal tower stage, but i still love it as much as i did when i was younger."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-14,"i just got a feeling the third game will not live up to the first two games... i hope i'm wrong, but i prefer to keep my expectations low"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-09,this is getting me even more hyped for little nightmares 3!! also very excited for ln 2 birthday tomorrow

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-09,"i'm eagerly and hopefully waiting for the release of ln3,."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-27,"interesting how the third one has much less emphasis on claustrophobic spaces, there's clearly some but theres also areas that are meant to feel uncomfortable for their vast openess with little in them. compare that to, say, the woods in ln2 where the landscape theoretically goes off into the distance in other directions than the way the characters are limited to travelling as part of the gameplay,.but the trees crowd close and make it feel like theres still walls close in on you, trapping the characters within what we can see boxing them in at the edges of the screen"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-07-06,"this song is very unique. i honestly love it. the singers did a phenomenal job on creating a catchy tune. andrea did a perfect job on her singing aswell. her voice is so beautiful and very terrifyingly elegant. and the rest did good aswell. their voices separately are very great. but together in a song is just so amazing in this song. the beat and lyrics just so fits the original game. the game is just so mysterious and creepy and this song did a good job of doing that. andrea's voice at around 208 is so creepy and so relatable to the geisha. and the effects on her voice just makes this song so much better. for me this is a hard challenge to make a song out of this game. as a result, you guys nailed this. your other songs are as good too. i love this and your guys' other songs. you guys are talented and keep up the good work. yasuki"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-23,"the ending is so insane. in the story, it wasnt monos first time going through the entire journey. in fact, he probably went through that exact journey a countless number of times without remembering it. when he was betrayed by six the very first time, he grew up to become tv man, otherwise known as the future mono. then fast forward to the future, mono was somehow able to rebirth and start over again, but he lost all prior memory about six or the betrayal. meanwhile, the future mono, tv man, knew what was bound to happen to his past self, so he tried to stop mono and six from succeeding. tv man wasnt the antagonist in the story, six was. tv man was monos future self trying to save him from a preventable fate. it doesnt end there. now that we know tv man was mono all along, theres another possibility. mono could be trapped in an endless loop of rebirthing, getting betrayed, and becoming tv man for the next mono. the reason why tv man wants to stop mono is because he wants to end the infinite loop and save mono from the inevitable shock and suffering when he gets betrayed. what a game."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-21,731 507
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,what are your thoughts? do you think that little nightmares 3 and reanimal looking so similar is a coincidence? either way i'm sure both games are going to be great fun to play and have a lot of effort behind them!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"the monsters in reanimal really look like something from the evil within or dark souls. also i love the title name idea, instead of reanimate its reanimal this could mean that dead animals are being reanimated into zombified mutant versions of themselves."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i heard that the main reason for tarsier leaving bandai was because of bandai's restriction on gore and the no speech rule. if that's the case it would explain why ln1 originally had six being ripped apart when she died but bandai probably knew this would make the game an instant 18 and decided against it.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"reanimal looks like the game tarsier always wanted make, and now that they have both the creative freedom and the experience making games, i could not be more excited for it, nor could i be more happy for tarsier themselves."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"finally, more little nightmares! i hope there'll be another streak of little nightmares theory videos. they're so good, eerie and just easy to binge watch."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"your not the only one who feels like there's something off abt ln3, ive been describing it as it feels more like a puzzle game than a horror game. and our main characters kinda feel softer and cleaner?? like compared to mono and six who look dirty and have that like 'survived' feeling ln3 protags feel a bit out of place. maybe it could even be the warmer tones of the game? whatever it is you can definitely tell that it's made by a different company and team. edit after watching the ln3 trailer multiple times i've noticed a few more things, they use a lot of blur for the backgrounds to the point where it feels like.. unnatural? and a lot of the animations and rigging feel stiff! especially for the baby! tho i do like the desert type theme they are going for in the first part i feel it's unique bcus i don't see a lot of deserts being used in horror media. the parts that feel the strongest and closest to ln is the sewer and carnival parts. but despite that they are still working on it and things can change so i'm excited for the finished product!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,bro you got me into the little nightmares series and its soooo gooood!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"james, actually the baby seen in the trailer for little nightmares 3 is an implementation of an enemy that wasnt made in little nightmares 2. in the concept art for ln2, the signal tower was made to be very different with lots of obstacles like headless men, lots of flesh everywhere and one of them was a giant flesh baby that mono had to face but they decided to scrap it. i guess this new baby is reincarnated in ln3 but different."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,the reanimal trailer genuinely terrified me of how scary it was. ln 3 im ok
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"watching beaver's theories cemented my interest in little nightmares. it's such a joy to see you delve into this franchise again, sir!! i hope you're doing well!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"this is a great video, but there is one thing you forgot to mention. the original dev team behind little nightmares 1 and 2 at least some of them are not at tarsier studios anymore. they branched off to form their own studio called section 9 interactive they are making their own game and while it is still in deep development it is worth keeping tabs on. what i like about indie devs is that they are not content to just make the same thing over and over again."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"little nightmares 3 looks like a video game, reanimal looks like a horror movie"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,finally ive been waiting for so long for a little nightmares 3 video
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i'm definitely looking forward to both games. reanimal does feel like little nightmare but you can definitely tell it has a different vibe in story and monsters. little nightmare 3 is promising and i did had the same feelings that you said in this video about little nightmare 3 but i'm still really looking forward to the game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"tbh my main reason why i feel off about the new trailer is it's artstyle first, but mainly the movement of the characters. when they used the bow and that other close ranged attack, the movements feel rather superficial. dunno if anyone else shares the sentiment."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,"little nightmares 3 feels off but i think that's a good thing, it seems like supermassive games didn't want to alter the story tarsier had for six and mono. i'm glad it's with new characters in a different region of the world. reanimal definitely leans more into horror while ln3 seems to lean more towards a thriller, which personally i don't mind."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-24,"the design of the playable characters in little nightmares iii and the copious amount of orange in the landscapes and trailer is what throws it off for me, it's much brighter and appears more 'vibrant.'"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,honestly if little nightmares 3 and reanimal do really good on both ends i'll be happy
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,i dont think reanimal is the true little nightmares 3. i feel like the devs want to tell a completely different story in a completely different world. little nightmares 3 is probably going to be a story set in the same world but with a completely different set of characters and a way different setting to not mess with part 12s lore.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"well, james. i want to play both of them, but its which one im looking forward to. 1. little nightmares lll i want to play that game first because i want to know what direction they are going with in this third installment. i had questions like is this game is going to break the cycle or destroy the evil entity in this world? who is low and alone? where does this fit in the timeline? i bet my questions will be answered in this game, but ill have to wait until early 2025. 2.reanimal im interested to play this. why? because since tarsier studios is not doing little nightmares content anymore, i was like what is their next project? well, reanimal. the similarities between reanimal and little nightmares is peaking my interests for this game. maybe this game is part of the little nightmares universe. maybe this game is sidecanon. who knows. but either way, i want to play these two games."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"gotta admit, i missed this vaguely spooky atmosphere"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"that trailer for reanimal is insane. this is the first time i saw it and im just blown away. when i saw the trailer for little nightmares 3 i completely agree, something just felt off, and it didnt feel fresh at all. but reanimal just looks so fresh while keeping what i love about little nightmares. i really cant wait for the reanimal release! the theory videos are peak"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i had no idea that this was happening thank you beaver for the information
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,this is fr what i feared of when tasier left little nightmares. when the 3 little nightmares got announced everything just didnt feel right. the fear that another studio cant pull of what tasier can probaly comes true.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"little nightmares 3 i put down to the different colour tone. the horror elements are there reanimal is going for a completely different approach, setting aside for a second, that unlike ln we actually see death and gore within the trailer. this clearly shows theyre going way darker than before, n im all for it"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,honestly its such a weird situation it kinda reminds me of after sonic 1 was made i know very weird comparison but sega studio went 2 different directions with sonic 2 and sonic cd releasing around the same time and it being very confusing which one was a sequel this kinda reminds me of it with the teams splitting off and making little nightmares 3 and reanimal separately just goes to show that theyre many collective differences between bandi and tasier
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"finally! after telling you about this for so long and even asking about your opinion on stream and saying i wasnt really feeling it., you finally made a video in this! good one on ya james!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-23,i feel someone needs to say that this is not a ln creation. this is its own world and its own story until we get some actual confirmation from tarsier.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"the thing is i love little nightmares so i cant say no to 3, but reanimal feels more like little nightmares than little nightmares 3. from the atmosphere to the cycling weirdo chasing the kids it just excites me more."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,remind me of the good old little nightmare theories with beaver....
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-22,"supermassive probably knows what they're doing, don't forget they ported ln2 which is the most important game in the series so far in terms of connecting the dots if even a little bit."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-25,"if you ask me, i actually feel like the reason little nightmares 3 feels slightly off is because the style of the trailer is different than the previous ones. the puzzles are being focused on a lot more opposed to monsters. to some extent, i really appreciate it as that means the actual monsters will be more of a surprise but focusing primarily on the world and puzzles does make the trailer feel a bit odd. ln3 also in general has a bit more of an updated look. its still similar and feels like an improvement but its undoubtedly slightly different. finally, it doesnt help knowing that tarsier studios isnt working on it anymore. its a common thing, but simply knowing something is different in a way than you expect causes you to be a lot more skeptical. at the end of the day, i really like the way little nightmares 3 looks and i trust itll feel like a little nightmares game. the only problemconcern i have is, is it really still ln if the only connection between the first two games six is missing? again, thats yet to be seen but im excited for ln3 nonetheless. i actually both like but dislike the way reanimal looks. while i can definitely appreciate the more darker horror vibe its going for, i already have slight complaints. firstly, the fact that the characters speak is honestly a bit of a letdown to me. i get that having dialogue is natural thing and should be seen as an evolution to the games made by tarsier, but i love the show, dont tell approach of little nightmares where in general, characters dont really speak apart from simple gestures, noises, or pain noises. to me, knowing there will be dialogue in a small way makes reanimal less exciting though i will definitely still be playing it. i will also say that the darker vibe it aims for is actually the main reason i dont think of it as a sequel to little nightmares 2 or even connected to it. while ln definitely contains a lot of horror, its always done so in a way that made it feel eerie or disturbing rather than outright scarycreepy. reanimal on the other hand seems to definitely be going more for a downright unsettlingscary vibe which im all for but i honestly dont see any connection to little nightmares because of it. the characters also make it seem like a different game imo due to how lanky they are but thats just a personal opinion with no actual reasoning behind it. one of the last reasons i dont think reanimal actually feels like a ln game is the use of walking back and forth. while its possible in ln1 and 2, back and forth movement has always been quite limited and usually just used to explore a short area before advancing to the next roomarea. reanimal seems as if itll actually be making use of forwardbackward movement which again, makes it feel more unique and less like a ln game to me since i always felt like ln takes its name quite seriously when applied to gameplay by making little levels of eerie nightmares. finally, i think the reason why people think this game feels like a ln game is because the trailer is done in a way that we expect from little nightmares. it shows off a lot more monsters than puzzles. i truly think that reanimal on launch will feel like a completely different experience while ln will feel like what you wantexpect of a ln game in terms of gameplay. at the end of the day, im really excited for both of these games, but as someone whos been a longtime fan of ln and enjoy the gameplay of it above all, i personally am more excited for ln3. that being said, ill definitely be giving reanimal a playthrough just to see what tarsier has been up to!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"when i originally saw the trailers, i didn't think much of it but now that you bring it attention does anybody else feel that with reanimal advertising itself with from the developers of little nightmares and little nightmares 2 is undermining all the potential hype for little nightmares 3? it'll be fine just to have said from the makers of little nightmares but specifically saying the first 2 games confirms that only bandai wanted to make little nightmares 3 and pushed supermassivegames into developing it. i know supermassivegames will do a fantastic job at it they're the developers behind until dawn  the dark pictures anthology franchise but the trailer alone for little nightmares 3 shows that the devs or whoever made the trailer is unfamiliar with the little nightmares franchise. at the end of the day, i'm really hyped for reanimal and i want to see little nightmares 3 succeed. hopefully you'd be able to cover both on the channel"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"in my opinion ln1,ln2 and reanimal feels like both enemies are corrupted and hungry for something and someone cause it, while ln3 feels like the place is decaying and got ruined from destructions but they teleport using mirror so the place they teleported to change into better place base on trailer, i wanna know the lore of these places, im excited for their release!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"i know this is a theory video, and i agree that theres probably concepts here from what they wouldve wanted a third little nightmares to be, but i dont think theres as much literal relation as people are seeming to make. i think its most likely just a new title made of scrapped elements of ideas they had for the previous little nightmares games, as well as whatever they possibly thought up for a third. and with the games looking as similar as they do, i think it just might be what the studios art style is, i dont think the similar look makes them connected in a literal sense, maybe spiritually but not story wise. plus the art style for reanimal is different, the proportions on the player characters looks much more realistic than the large headedsmall bodied player characters in ln. i think having smaller characters in a bigger environment might just be what they found works best with their horror, having a large sense of scale, but i think it works best with ln because it visualizes how large the threats feel to the children. also recent media has seemed to have done severe damage to how people see series and franchises now because seeing people suggest theres a multiverse for this stuff is honestly ridiculous to me. maybe theres a slight possibility, but 1 tarsier doesnt own the rights to ln, so i doubt they could really suggest a connection to it in a way that matters, 2 not everything needs to be seen in a universe or multiverse scale, little nightmares is a world. its a bit frustrating too how many people ive seen trying to connect this to ln especially when the studio has emphasized this is a new world. like let them make something new let them make what they want, as much as i love the ln series i wouldnt want tarsier to be making them forever, im glad they can spread their creative wings and try something new"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"im so happy, i think i could burst into tears. this is all i wanted from a little nightmares sequel, up the ante n up the horror of it all. third trailer felt odd to me too, character design on its own just doesnt feel right. glad tarsier is cooking this beautiful craft. lets all thank beaver for bringing this to our attention. my goat fr."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,little nightmares? haven't heard that in years
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-16,"i'm really excited for ln3 and it really has grown on me, but what put me off the moment i saw it was how vibrant the character designs are. with six, her yellow raincoat was a highlight, and the only bright coloured thing between her and mono. with the new ones, the girls very colourful, with the red hair, green coat, etc, its a very loud and decorated design. they didn't capture the bleak, dull colours that i personally really loved and associated with little nightmares. even in ln1 it wasn't so colourful, imo. this was just my first impression months ago though"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-09,honestly im very excited to play both of them with my wife  as she watched me play the first two ln games and now she gets to join in! ln3 looks cool and i think we should still supoort the series and couchco op games. but reamimal looks like its on a whole different level!!! so hyped
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"now that ive watched the whole video, it gets me thinking of a qna tarsier did a long time ago i think it was after ln dlc when asked about a potential sequel, they responded by saying they were ready to tell new stories unrelated to ln. so its possible reanimal was what they had in mind, and it was never ment to be connected to ln. then again, that interview was a long time ago and im just going off of what i remember. still excited for both games! 2 ln style games for the price of one!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-25,"hardly makes sense to even consider that reanimal is the ln sequel, even if the inspiration may be there. one feels like a surreal horrible dream, the other feels like a realistic horrible terror"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,047 not gonna lie this disappoint me since i wanna play a version of little nightmares like this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,and suddenly im 13 years old again watching beaver make ln1 theories this video was so good!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-02,"436 bro, there's an enemy on a tricycle?! hell yeah!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,im excited for both. they both look pretty good.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-23,dude your the first person who ive heard express the way ive felt about little nightmares 3. everyone feels oblivious to how much they are just reusing stuff from the previous games to play it safe and how its just not the same
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"i want the monsters in reanimal to say wheres everyone going, bingo when they lose you"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,019 unfortunate he never made it in the game
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"thanks beaver for being awesome! ive been watching you since i was 12, back in the jurassic park builder days! its been great to see how far this channel has gone!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"you were the reason i got into little nightmares, as well how i found your channel in the first place! i binged all of your little nightmares gameplay and theories. i feel like reanimal have much more of the vibe that little nightmare 1  2 have vs 3 which feels lacking. i'm defiantly looking forward to see how reanimal is, and hoping you'll be doing a gameplay of it on the channel!!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i'm glad i wasn't the only one who felt off when i saw the little nightmares 3 trailer. reanimal scratches that ln itch!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,reanimal looks so scary and it will definitely have some nightmare fuel moments like those designs are crazy like no maam.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"the 3rd one looks ok, but the second one definitely felt like an increase in gameplay. a little unfortunate that it's not the same creators who made the first two games, but we can't judge too quickly, lets just wait and hope its something worth waiting for."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-07,"so personally i am always sceptical of every new thing that turns out to be a sequel of something i like, because i was let down a few times to. but looking back i think i was just so afraid that the thing i loved so much will be ruined that i didnt really enjoy it even though it was great. so guys lets wait, lets not think the worst if we can and enjoy the privilege to even play it. i hope you guys have a great day"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-09,"ln3 felt like it was relying a bit too much on existing mechanics from the previous titles and made it feel a lot more video gamey with the inclusion of items. it didnt feel like the next step in the series but more like a hey, remember that eye that would turn you into stone? we did the same but now its a giant mecha baby! i might be too harsh on a game thats not even out yet but thats just how it came across to me beyond excited for reanimal though"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,the controversy behind both ln3 and reanimal has left me disappointed. both games look awesome and just seeing people going against each other over both games has disheartened me. also reanimal is it's own thing btw. this is an original ip because tarsier left ln because they got purchased by embracer group. bandai namco could have purchased tarsier but it didn't happen.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,"here's how i see it currently, little nightmares 3 for better or for worse is going to be the next little nightmares from a story perspective. reanimal on the other hand is going to be the next little nightmares game in sence of game design. now this isn't to say that i think little nightmares 3 will be bad story wise or not do anything new. what i'm trying to get at is that tarsier studios didn't want to continue little nightmares, maybe it was what you said with them being forced to make 2 before they were ready, maybe they just thought it was over after 2, and maybe they just wanted to try somthing different. whatever the case they are taking the things they learned from little nightmares and making something new out of it. in the same way supermassive games the team working on little nightmares 3 is taking the world, the ideas, and the gameplay we know and love from the first 2 games and they're making they're own thing with it. for better or for worse, who knows. personal i think that supermassive games will do a good job, they've worked on a lot of horror games and seem to genuinely care about the series. so even if it loses a few things in transition i think little nightmares is in good hand."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-19,yayy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm so happy you created a reaction theory!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-25,"can we just accept that tarsier is making a game that isnt little nightmares? we are getting a little nightmares 3, and reanimal. we are getting two cakes. just.. enjoy them both."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"im more excited for reanimal. it feels right more questions to ask just like when i first saw little nightmares 1 and 2, reanimal is the game i cant wait to see more from"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i really love your videos always makes me smile ty james!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-23,"its because they have more original monsters. like, the baby just seems..unoriginal. and the lamb? its just..better."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i think ln3 is a prequel to ln1 and 2. since the doll looks like a 50s baby doll a 70s carnival and a castle which could take place before six and mono. traveling through time using the mirrors. as for reanimal i think it takes place during ln1 and 2, where the signal tower from ln2 causes the animals to mutate. the brother and sister trying to save their friends are maybe also save the children from ln1 and 2, but got washed away to a farm island and trying to get everyone safely and escape. my remarks even though the two game that are coming and watching the trailers , i still like both of them even though the companies are parting ways. i have a haunch that both games are related."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-06,reanimals looks like little nightmares 2 got a resident evil coat of paint
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,maybe the real little nightmares were the goblins we met a long the way?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-27,gb ooo which one is the true sequel? everyone reanimal. as exciting for ln3 could be i think i'm getting reanimal first.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"i had lots of issues with your theories of yore, but this series made ur channel partially what it is today! im mainly concerned that this game is going to overwrite the previous games and make it to where the signal tower isn't gonna be the true big bad of the universe anymore. imagine if some crappy vial of darkness turns out to be the cause of everything lol. also thanks for being my first ever youtuber. i watched your slither io vids when i was 9 on my dad's cruddy computer lol i'm 17 now! luv yah beavs 3"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-23,"well, i definitely see where youre coming from. its important not to downplay pin these games against each other by saying, this is the true sequel also have some money im a big fan"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"i really hope it turns out being ln's spiritual successor, much like dark souls is to demon's souls"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,beaver's little nightmares videos are what not only made me love the videos he put out on it but also the game itself. his were the only theories i really listened to and i'm so happy he's doing a video on it now!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i don't really like how people say this is the new little nightmares on reanimal. i think there both great..and people are literally so rude about little nightmares 3.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,god beaver u dont know how long ive been waiting for another little nightmares vid
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-31,"one thing that bugged me a little about little nightmares 3 is the character design of the 2 main characters. what i liked about six was that she was plain except her yellow coat. with rk, he was a plain boy, except his blue shirt. mono was very plain except his bag hat. with these kids, it just seems like they arent plain at all. especially the red head specificallyshe has red hair, thats already a big thing that makes her stand out in this games atmosphere. her neon outfit, her big goggles, even her hair is in pigtails and spiky. nothing about her says vulnerable child. like i feel like i would find this kind of costume of hers in gameplay when we look for it, like mono did with hats. her outfit feels majorly customized and not like how it actually should be if that makes sense i was kinda hopeful that bandai would make a good threquel because they made the mobile very little nightmares and it ended up pretty good, but i'm really not loving the atmosphere so far. it's desertlike, which doesn't feel very scary at all. ln1 atmosphere was eerie because we're left wondering where we are, when we discover a boatish place called the maw. second game's atmosphere was great because it was a rainysetting which felt very doomsdaylike, but sand and desert?... eh."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-25,"this brings me back. when i was a kid, and i used to be terrified of your videos on little nightmare this brings me back."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,"is it too much to be excited for both?? i'm excited for both little nightmares 3 and reanimal. it's not like the people who developed 3 is completely unfamiliar to the series as they helped with 2. from where i'm standing, we're getting more little nightmares regardless."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-30,"honestly, this is something more than little nightmares. something dark, primal, and filthy. there is something evil in this world, and it is crueler than any nightmare."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"james, i have a question will you be playing both games and will you be giving your opinion on if it was similar to little nightmares or not?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-04,"both games look great, and i can't wait for both of em."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,i think the reason why little nightmares 3 feels different is because supermassive games took over  added their style of gameplay to the franchise while keeping the core elements the same as the other games.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"i started watching you years ago for the dinosaur content but the little nightmares content was something else. especially your theories, they were so good and your iconic style of commentary and narration adds the cherry on top!! please more mr.beaver"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-08,"i also noticed in little nightmares 3, its a lot more kinda cartoony than the first and second game. yes, all games show nightmarishly unreal monsters and entitys but they all had a realistic vibe that lended to them being creepy and unnerving, the cracking of the teachers neck, wrinkles of the chiefs masks, etc. and on top of that, in most situations, you were largely helpless, meant to run from most encounters. in little nightmares 3, you both have actual weapons constantly and might be facing smaller enemies constantly. and the monsters seen are for more.....less real looking i guess? like i can imagine the chiefs, the hunter, the teacher, the lady, i can see those as real. the giant baby doll on the other hand seems far to impossible, that and the fact it uses the medusa eye thing even though it has no real connection to it erks me. all the other monsters we've seen just look like large distorted people, like off brand guests, so that doesn't help. i also noticed the general style seems different? everything looked real, like six and mono with no mask, you can see every other hair strand, you could see their skin, you could see every disgusting detail in the monsters. but in little nightmares 3, our characters have simple blobs to look like hair, the giant doll looks to polished still despite the cracks. all in all the style and gameplay look like its changed a lot, which explains why it looks like little nightmares without feeling like little nightmares. and good job if you made it this far!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,"beaver the new gigantoraptor, allosaurs, pachyrhinosaurus, and sea scorpion mods as well as the official dinosaur mirigia have all just released"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,maybe the real little nightmares were the friends we made along the way.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-07,"i swear....tarsier studios has a certain vibe to it that no other companies can replicate...for me, little nightmares ended on the second game, like you said, the third just doesn't feel right...but i guess im happy that tarsier decided to make another game...one that will absolutely blow the internet"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-25,i hate people that saysreanimal is the real little nightmares sequel no its not its a different game created by the same creators of little nightmares ok thank you
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-07,it would be amazing if the universe splitted at one point like in mortal kombat and the worlds are just canon to eachother
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"its not little nightmares 3 or reanimal for me, were getting two cakes, ima play them both."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-25,"thank you for letting me know about reanimal, it looks amazing! i hope you'll do theory videos on it when it comes out!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,its finally here!!!!!!!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"although i like the whole bandai forcing them to make sequels idea, but you forget that in secrets of the maw, the little nightmares dlc, you can see that in the post credit scene there was a teaser for ln2, meaning tarsier did intend for a sequel"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-09,"onestly i don't get all the hate for little nightmares iii or this is not our little nightmares bro you didn't even play the game. saying that reanimal is the real little nightmares is crazy to me because it takes a lot from ln but it has a completely different aestetich. since when is little nightmares scary? sure there are some parts that are frightening, however overall it has a horror aestetich, it never was terrifying. so why do we have to hate one or another? why can't we be extited for both of them? they can both be great games ps for the desert part i'm actually quite intrested in seeing a place frome the nowhere with different colors and vibes from the ones before."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the gaming beaver is back with ln content baby!! been warching for 8 years now
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"it definitely seems that reanimal is tarsiers way of setting the record straight and having the last word. this is their creation, and they probably dont want bandai to corporatize their child. we can enjoy both certainly, but i stand with tarsier."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,reanimal seems amazing! theres even voice acting!!! i am so excited! eeeeee! i mean those creaturesmonsters are truely horrific and amazing! so very excited! i am still excited for little nightmares 3 but not as excited as i am for this
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"a long time ago, in 2016 thats not a long time ago"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-06,i truly believe that reanimal is what little nightmares 3 should have been but tarsier have done an amazing job at keeping that horror aspect to the little nightmares franchise i'm very excited for reanimal but i'm looking forward to seeing what little nightmares 3 has to offer and where the story goes also. have you noticed in the little nightmares 3 trailer where the two children chuck an item into the furnace with the gnome standing beside them? it looks oddly familiar to the furnace in the runaway kid dlc from little nightmares 1
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-21,"i feel like little nightmares 3 feels off is becuase of the bright areas while reanimal feels like how it does is because of the dark lighting dark atmospheare, i feel like little nightmares 3 wouldn't feel off if it was in a dark setting"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,congratulations the gaming beaver has officially hit 4m subscribers!!!!.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-09-01,"i'm usually terrified of horror games, but this game has a certain feel to it that i want to play it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-09-25,"it honestly freaks me out how much this reminds me of my own dreams. wonky perspectives, weird angles, creatures with jittery movements like a stopmotion animation, unseen horrors that chase you, benign settings like bedrooms and hallways made scary through shadows and mismatched details... i'm definitely going to give this game a try!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-08-18,"loving the art style, hope the gameplay lives up to it"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-06-08,"is no one asking that there was going to be a banana clock in the game in 059. when i played the game, i didn't see no banana clock anywhere. this is outrageous, banana clock must return!,"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-08-18,i love this so much. it's creepy and dark but still has a sort of charm to it. not pure horror but still scary and weird. 10 minutes of gameplay looked amazing too.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-08-22,tim burton's adaptation of little big planet.

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,no release date yet. but i'm still happy to see new things. the supervisor really hits the ln vibe.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,so the supervisor is always monitoring the factory? that's terrifying.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,ah i see. so the moment we enter the factory she straight up notices us and stalks us through the cameras? that's something new and it's terrifying.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,the supervisor is literally playing fnaf
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,i love how much personality they gave low and alone.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,"the description having every sweet you eat is very interesting. i understand it's a candy factory, but maybe some of this could be connected to otto or noone, especially with otto's iconic line, sweets for my sweet"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,119 little nightmares atmosphere  jumpscares....great
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,"this trailer shows a lot of things, like the many tvs, similar to ln2 and more of the supervisor and the candy factory! it would be cool if there would also be more secret achievements in the game like the past. i imagine there might be one related to the candy factory."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,this trailer... with the way it captures the little nightmares vibes you know it's going to be good. way too pumped for this game to come out next year hhhhhhhhhhhh
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-01,"okay this is actually one of the most freakish designs ive ever seen, like the multiple clawlike arms, that face that can show that there is no sane thoughts in that head, the raspy breathes and horrific noises she makes that make her feel like an animal or even a demon. god everything works"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,"i already put it on my steam wishlist. as a long time little nightmares fan, i'm very excited for that game! i'm looking forward to it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,"alright im gonna give all my thoughts and theories. originally after first seeing this trailer, i thought that the candy woman was going to be the big bad and the factory was as gonna be the last chapter in little nightmares 3. thats definitely how theyre framing it. but i dont think thats the case. i think theyre giving her the teacher treatment. in little nightmares 2, the teacher was heavily advertised in trailers and many thought that she was going to play a much bigger role. i think this trailer is simply showcasing an individual chapter probably chapter 2 or 3 and whatever is up with the mirrors from the last trailer will still be the big reveal and main focus of the game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,"i've seen a lot of comments complaining about the date, they had already announced that the game would be released in 2025. if you really are fans of little nightmares, let's let supermassive games work well and at its own pace. the trailer is beautiful, let's not rush the company, they are doing an excellent job. 3"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-31,"alright, now that's a good fucking trailer. they should have released this one for their announcement, it's the right amount of little nightmares freaky"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-07-18,"alright, for everybody confused on the plot  ending the maw is where this takes place, an island for where ppl with money or rich people basically, can go to and eat all they want, they eat any kind of meat, including the flesh of children. basically, children are taken from their families and are put in the prison. at first they're given food and toys to play with but when they get older and bigger, those giant nasty chef's cook them  serve them to the fa uhh, i mean, obese people. six sasha lol is the daughter of the lady the woman who was looking in the mirror, but she's obsessed with beauty. she's never satisfied with how she looks which is why every mirror she had was broken. but, the reason six, or sasha, was in prison is because she was more beautiful than the lady, so, the lady was mad salty about it and sent six to the prison because she was angry tht six was more beautiful than her. oh btw, the lady is running the maw, she's the one in charge of the entire thing. so anyway, when six got ahold of the mirror, which the lady hid, six killed her mom with it. reason being the lady was so obsessed with beauty, she couldn't stand how she looked since six was more beautiful than her so it drove her insane to the point where she'd die. after six killed her, she got hungry, so she ate some of the lady and took some of her powers. the lady's powers were basically the ability to drain ppl so she can be immortal  live forever. so, while six was walking down the hallway like a boss, she was basically draining the obese people, draining the life outta them which is why they died. and when she walked up the stairs to the sunlight, tht was basically her escaping all the madness. and that's what happened ."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-01-24,that sausage is actually human meat so dont feel so bad
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-01-26,"cory you on the couch with ya girl watching coryxkenshin, put ya hand on her thigh my dog  me"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-08,they left us hanging
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-14,it looks so similar to the thin man tbh
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-08,"if you take the fact that the chair he would have stood on to get to the rope is actually too far away into account, you realize that he most likely didnt do that to himself."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-06,the most disturbing part about this is how short the chair is compared to his body
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-17,"this video has the same vibes as look gang, a door! i wonder where it leads well never know"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-08,it would have been cool to see him just holding onto something to show likehey this man is trying to climb up or hey he is just doing sports
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-19,a lotta people think this is the thin man but its actually a character that didnt make it in the game. his name was the wax bellman because his face looked like melting candle wax. you can even find a concept of him hanging done by the devs edit i read the replies and apparently i need to play very little nightmares cuz i never heard of the pretender nor her father. p.s. thanks for the likes
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-11,what does he look like?? dunno
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-01,plot twist he's doing pullups
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-25,i feel like this guy could be a version of the thin man older mono for some reason
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-10,he was a fairy
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-06,"i gently open the door sayo nvm, your not sayori."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-13,i believe monothin man tried to break the loop by killing himself
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-01,why is bro so high off the chair
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-10,could we get a iron lung out of bounds video?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-27,"that loop was so clean that it's super foul. closes out with the character model is unfinished so we don't know and then what does the hanging man look like right after, tricked me into thinking there was more lmao"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-21,"everyone knows that thin man is mono, so my theory is that when this man is mono.. he did it to end the cycle"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-28,moral of the story never leave your friend hanging
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-03,"you know, its always funny hearing but they faked their death or variations of it, never gets old lol"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-28,they really did think we wouldn't know.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-18,"hes not hanging, hes doing pull ups."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,the fact that he's so englongated is unsettling both in the dark and not.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-05,"guys this was a scrapped character that never made it into the game called wax bellman they just decided to put him there as an easter egg and in the song that plays on the tv there are lyrics that say hes gone hes gone hes gone he hung dont leave me no more bellman, among the sea"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-15,"off topic, but that chair looks too small for him"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-10,"i think its the tall man or whatever his name is because the man has the same clothes, skin, and height if his model would have been finished"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-20,how could you leave us on a cliff hanger?!?
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-30,if you install a mod to change the tall man it changes the hanging man so there you go
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-14,"the chair is too small and it's still under his feet, he didn't do it himself."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-07,bro summoned the omori fandom
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-15,i love the little nightmare games so much especially dantdms play through
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-17,he is just hanging around
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-07,finally a yt short that loops in a way that isnt annoying as hell
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-22,i was think that he is further mono
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-03,the hanging man is the thin man there to remind six of her horrible actions
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,the perfect loop doesnt exis
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-05,the hanging man fr is us after the most normal day in school
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-09,i wish they added the full body.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-13,well the hanging man is the baggy guy from little nightmare 2 edit tysm for 10 likes d
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-01,mono is thin man and that man looks like thin man so much so that means monos future self k!lled himself because of six i think
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-27,i think its like whatever the villain of the second game was he just realize theres no point like theres no point
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-07,"my guess is that it's the thin man who, after his fight with mono, got teleported to a tv in the maw. upon realizing that he failed to save mono, he... y'know"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,dude its just a halloween decoration
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-26,great game! so excited for little nightmares 3!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-19,i still dont know the logic of hoe he hanged him self the chair is too tiny for him to do such a thing and why is that chair so tany
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-24,i just realized that man is the tall thin man in the second game!!!!!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-26,spoiler for those who didn't play ln1 and ln2 legend says that thin man who is mono kept goin back in time and failing in saving mono and got stuck in a time loop which led him to give up and suicde and that what we saw in ln1 the hanging man so we come to conclusion that ln2 events were before ln1... and the ending of ln1 is the island that six was trying to escape with mono in ln2 so six is stuck in that island and tried to escape twice now there's more things that is still confusing like what will happen to six and if ln2 was b4 ln1 then where did the evil spirit of six came from at the ending of ln2 that means ln2 is not b4 ln1 then the tall ded man may not be mono which lead to the question. what happend to mono and whats that letter down the ded man and more......
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-08,since little nightmares 2 came out over years ago. he looks like the thin man mono that just really got fed up with everything from betrayal and the thought of him not going back to what he once were
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-21,mono suicide to break the time loop
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-23,"yup, that makes perfect sense."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-19,this is me in a few years
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-05,what a helpful short
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-09,"in the story, its the thin man mono"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-11-11,pretty sure the hanging man being so tall and skinny with a very similar looking chair is a hint to the sequelprequel
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-07,its the thin man.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-03,this is the main antagonist of little nightmare2
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"my theory is that it's the tall man, a.k.a mono take a look at the chair recognise it? they must have ended little nightmares 2's loop by that as number 2 being a prequel."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,lmao the legs just look hilarious
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-08,its thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-16,i like that they added a rope anyways despite the model not being finished
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-08,wow thats kewl im early
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-01,i think he is the thin man who wanted to end his life. thats my head cannon poor mono
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-08,i'm the 666th like!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-01,me personally i think this is a result to one of the time loops in little nightmares 2 where mono just had enough.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-08,the real hangman game
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-24,you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain..
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,i think it would be the thin man bc we dont see him appear in the first game and he probably did this as a way to end the cycle of mono being betrayed over and over
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-17,"some people think that could be mono, but it makes more sense to me that he turned into the man in a hat"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-26,i think that everyone will agree that its thin man from my little nighmers 2
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-01,leder from mother 3 really had it rough
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-21,hes just doing a pull up
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-07-21,my phone was turned down and i thought this was a loop
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-22,this had the potential for a allan had details meme
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-10,it has to be the guy with the hat on
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-15,talk about a cliffhanger
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-07,"there needs to be a moniter at these interviews where someone can say hey, pull up this legislature or that data just to immediately set down what must be agreed upon as true"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-19,i have a theory that the thin man couldn't tell his past self mono that he shouldn't trust six and ended his own life hanging him with a rope in his neck
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-01,"id like to believe that it was monothe thin man that finally escaped the time loop and realised his actions, leading to his suicide"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-15,its probably the wax bellman
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-17,not gonna lie he did looked like someone who would hang out
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-05,ok this is the first video iv watched of yours and why do i keep hearing saber spark.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-06,"the first time i saw the ending, i thought mono was this guy"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-09,that's the bellman  you see welcome also the tv shoe song that distracted roger janitor says no more bellman among our sea
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-09,bro did the forbidden neck workout
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-01,"tbh my nephews mom played little nightmares in front of my nephew and niece, and they were too young to see the horrors, glad they got a new mom"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,looks like that guy is hanging around here
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-16,"2 was a prequel, maybe it was a memory moment for her we didn't know at the moment"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-14,important bit of information originally it seemed like we were planned to go up there as theres concept art for what his face would look like
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-17,1 thing i know that that man is not thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-03-11,youtube knows ive been playing little nightmares recently
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-28,plot twist nothing.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-13,that's probably an early review of the thin man
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,that....chair is too small for him to have....stepped off it.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-25,"id say he was an employee there, but when he knew what they were doing with the children, he was so shocked and ashamed to be working with them that he dropped himself"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-20,perfect loop at the end and start
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-15,shit this gose kinda sad because suicide is not the way out
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-22,i've always thought those were just the legs of the janitor since he doesn't have any legs.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"i would've modeled a fully fleshed out face that's smiling and eyes wide open, just because of people like you. not that what you do it is wrong. it's like the sinnys in batim"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-20,that chair looks like the one mono sat on
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-11-14,it might be the thin man that hanged himself to end his suffering
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-31,"clearly, he's actually a floating lure for an even bigger predator. we are on a boat after all"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-15,"that is very odd, but i guess they did that so it would be easier instead of stretching and angling his body even more."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-16,janitor 1 yo help me out bro janitor 2 i got u homie
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-16,well use the power of friendship
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-16,"just so everybody knows. to my knowledge, theres only one janitor. a second one was used to make it easier"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-09,its a horror show if you dont look behind the scenes but a comedy show once you do
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-27,"being a game developer, it would be easier to just have a already loaded in janitor with working rigs rather then making a completely new rig and you don't even see the full body, its a common trick used by lots."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-13,the fact that they actually made the other janitor walk over is just more hilarious to me than it should've been.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-29,bro clones himself just so he didnt need to strain both arms
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-28,"thank heaven, that is hidden. otherwise i would never want to play this game again"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-05,i think it's just an easier way to animate the arms without stretching the model out
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-30,"nah thats just the janitors twin brother, the custodian"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-16,what i didn't expect is they animated it walking first
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-26,the fact they gave j2 a walk animation
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-02,they animated him walking in
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-16,bro got the whole squad searching
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-16,with the power of friendship!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-15,"actually i am impressed that there is whole janitor, while it could be only hands."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-15,makes me curious about the libertarian in little nightmares 2.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,"he says when the players in the hallway, the players in a vent"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-12,they added 2 bc his body isnt that long and they would have to stretch it just to have one janitor which is a waste of time considering the player isnt supposed to see that part of the map
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-11-26,"since you cant see through the wall, i wonder why they didn't just place 2 arms behind the wall instead of the entire janitor?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-03,dude this is how games made you don't want to know behind the scene
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-23,yass ilove behind the scenescutunused content
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-09,it took me 3 years to realize he isnt wearing a blond gold thats his skin
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-20,we are using the power of friendship
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-07,if there was actually 2 janitors then im never playing little nightmares again
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-07,amazing to see how games work out of the player's camera. absolutely love it!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-19,you love to see partners in this day and age
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-16,"i love this type of game making, if it's not seen in the camera then give the least amount of effort as you can. the logical approach would just to stretch the model but it's way easier to just make 2 and use one arm each."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-22,bro used shadow clone jujustu
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-05,they short af also its crazy they put a body for something you cant see instead of just 2 arms
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-09,scrolled for a bit but didnt see anything about this as far as why they did this for sure. they simply flipped mirrored one janitor to make two janitors to save time and effort on trying to make the one janitor reach out of both slits. honestly just smart game making. save yourself the time and headache.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-09,this might be the same for the boss fight of the janitor
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-08,that's jerry he just came to help his bro
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-01,bro called his homie
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-14,i still love the game tho it's a great game

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-20,this is my first ever little nightmares thing i saw
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-02,the scenes creepy asf behind the scene goofy asf
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-16,when the little brother who gets bullied on the game calls his big brother
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-21,makes sense. when i played i felt like they were spaced too far to be able to reach that deep into the crack compared to how his body is built. but i initially figured they just had phantom arms behind the scenes.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-30,"its because it was probably much easier to paste a mirrored version next to the original, than it was to stretch him out"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,there are secretly twins
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-01,it's almost like that was the easiest way to make the arms that long because they didn't want to change the model
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-12,hes in there!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-12,love the comic book accurate look but realistic feel to it  if that made sense
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-11-20,woahh i didnt know the janitor had a friend to help him
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-15,now they look like the twin chefs
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-12,"i dont know if i can explain it, the developer probably didnt wanted to push the limits of the model, bcs we can notice that the physics of the models are so perfect maybe if they streched both arms of a singular janitor it would make a lot of tension on the model making it more difficult so 2 janitors with perfect arms would do better and be easier"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-15,cool detail

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-01,it's just his brother he wanted to help him before he goes to bed
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-01,lol i was watching a youtuber called special edd play little nightmares and he yelled i know damn well you were not that wide!this explains it
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-02-12,"so instead of translating the position of the arm they duplicated him? i keep being reminded that you dont need the best practices to make a successful game, just a fun game. it was perfectly possible to just dislocate the arms or even make a cutscene specific model for this section that was only the arms and both of these would have saved a little bit of vram and performance."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-20,"this is pretty common, gta has the same character 2 times in multiple scenes, 1 could be the character you just arrived with, the other will be just for the cutscene. you only see 1 of them so it doesn't break immersion. in rendering we do this all the time too to make renders faster."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-29,it would make the developer's work easier since the player aint seeing the background anyway
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-22,"i played little nightmares four while playthroughs, and for some reason i thought that was the gorilla tag gorilla"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-26,"wonder if we'll ever get to see janitor in little nightmares iii, or at least some hint after what happened when uh, ya know six freaking amputated his arms"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i think it would be harder for making the hand come off when it's one whole thing so it's 2 so that it easier to program
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-06-14,"it's funny how little people know about how games are made and how many difficulties you have to deal with, and yet they complain about everything"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-19,guess they did that because his arms aren't long enough for it to be to scale and still be possible to evade his grasp

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-17,i think the game developers were to lazy to reanimate the other arm so they just mirrored the janitor and used his mirrored self as the other arm
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-02,its so the arms can be further apart without breaking the rig
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-27,bro tf youtube read my brain and gave me this video after i thought how would the janitor look after his hand get cut in the game obviously

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-07-06,"you know why the vent scene is terrifying? well first a long necked woman getting your ass in a claustrophobic vent, but also you can hear the piano, her bashing the keys, and that was not uncontrolled or her being startled, that was her realizing her music was letting you escape, and so out of pure determination and ignoring literally every odd against her, she just puts herself through the pain of the vent."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-08-20,"i have played the game but from what i have seen this is the vibe i an getting. the player is exploring a child's trauma caused by abuse. the imagery and atmosphere really hits home for me. plus the the child has a bag over their head. that cam symbolizes a form of escapism and that they view themselves as ugly, believing that is the reason for the abuse. also the monsters who have terrifying forms are human. i don't know if the developers intend this but this the deeper meaning that i am picking up."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-26,"according to the pro theorists, itsjustjord, itstimetotheorize and superhorrorbro, the tower was the true enemy of the game, not the thin man or six. they also said the tower infected six with escapism through its transmission just like it did with the viewers, except instead of the tvs, sixs escapism attached her to the music box. apparently, the tower made six its new host to use as bait so it could get to mono, since his power allowed it to survive. they also said, the tower was watching mono and six through the tv the entire time, and didnt like them together because if they stayed together, mono would have ended his loop, so it forced them to fight each other in order to finally separate them."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-29,man casually skips by a betrayal event that would cause anyone to begin their revenge arc.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-27,were besties for sure yall so close that six had to separate
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-10,"missed stuff six betrays you and mono is thin man and all of this is connected in a loop until someone stops it which is what thin man wants to do thin man wants to end the loop by taking six away but it only causes more harm then good. i am still recovering from the aftermath of this game but good night, good luck. edit i also forgot to add something, if somehow six did save mono, either, a six would eat mono or b mono would turn into thin man and do something to six. but these are just theories."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-24,"if she got hungry at the end, she could've betrayed you so she wouldn't have to eat you."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-28,the thin man is good explaint hear me out the thin man wasent trying to hurt mono the thin man was stoping him from going deeper into the loop when you defeated the thin man he was holding a stop sign to go deeper because the thin man knew sasha was going let go of monos hand and when sasha lets go of monos hand for mono to turn into the thin man then low turns into the thin man in littlenightmares chapter 7 follow for more
