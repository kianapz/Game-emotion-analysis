Puzzle,Inside,2023-05-10,"the whole thing was an art project. that is my theory. the apartment owner wanted an artpiece derived of human insanity never seen before, so the goal was to trap a robber, make them go insane, and whatever things they broke, built, or drew, was considered art. i believe this because of the final cinematic shots of the tower and nemos wall scribbles. it is also suspicious his partners gave up on him so quickly. so yes, i believe the entire experience, was in itself, an art projectperformancepiece."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-06-09,"never seen the movie...but....walls are usually easier to break through than people think. the door might have been reinforced, but the walls were probably aluminum stud walls. even if there was some sort of firewall, it's a very thin piece of metal. anything bigger for that amount of space would weigh too much. knowing she smoked right outside the door, worst case, you can still leak water out from under the wall because a plate wouldn't go all the way through the subfloor, which could get her attention for maintenance."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"moving to netflix was not the greatest business decision. its netflix though and overtime, for many, it has gone downhill. im personally not supporting netflix nor giving them a dime of my money when there isnt really a good selection of shows for me and some controversial things tied to their platform. last year, sidemen fans from all places could watch it for free on youtube. now even if you had netflix, its not available for some fans in other countries  just money hungry and now you lost a great chunk of fans viewership"

Puzzle,Inside,2023-06-27,"a few things which may have worked is 1 he could bottle pool water and refrigerate it it make ice cubes. these couldnt be eaten, but could help cool him down. 2 perhaps he could destroy the toilet. this may lead a hole big enough for him to climb through and possibly get out through the walls floor. if the hole was too small. after getting the sprinkler system on the water could have leaked down to lower floors and got someones attention. as the water would be dripping through walls the water may reach lower floors, increasing the chances of someone reporting a problem."

Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-30,"my theory behind this is that the kid you play as is being controlled by the person who made all those underground or secret rooms so you can unplug the reach of the other people that control. sorta like taking away some strings from the puppet master while also finding a way to destroy the kid, with the result of the blob's escape. and the person controlling the kid is probably wanted by the others who control and the people who control knows that the wanted person is controlling the kid, that's why they will shoot you on sight or grab you. then again, someone already said this. and probably explain it better"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-30,"i always wonder about how the boy seems to be the most free at the beginning, even though there are people out there seemingly rounding people up, like, he's out in just farmland. why does he go towards the factory? is he trying to infiltrate the factory is that the whole goal? or is it that although he seems to have more free will than the others, there's still some sort of hold on him drawing him into the facilities? or is some other thing controlling him in order to wreak havoc on the lab  join the meatball etc? like it seems like the most preferable option would just be to stay  live with the lil chickens, no?"

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"i played this game just now as it was really cheap online. i honestly can't find any flaw in it, in terms of what it sets out to accomplish and what it accomplishes. not long, but every passage is well made, interesting , not boring. game is challenging at points, but it never feels like it is unfair or cheating you when you do what you have to, or should. and great art and music for such a low budget project, the ending especially felt like something out of a movie blockbuster, incredibly well made. plus there is meaning, you can contemplate what the dystopic world and the mind control symbolizes. really, a small game, but among the best stuff i ever played."
Puzzle,Inside,2018-11-13,"to me this game was a masterpiece. i don't know why people are so anal about there being no back story, or that the ending is so grim. to me, yeah it was grim, but kind of in a symbolic way. this was one games where the story was more of an experience than a traditional story. it's not a perfect comparison, but it is kind of like the movie gravity. yeah there's more of a story there in gravity, but for the most part, it's just an event that is occuring and the viewer is there to experience it. this games art design, atmosphere, music and gameplay were all so great that i was happy experiences the story through the environment rather than needing to be told why, where or to what end."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-20,"even if movies and novels doesn't teach us anything, it's not rocket science to presume those off the books black ops cloak and dagger stuff will never ever leave behind a paper trace. i think it's more obvious now than ever, thay the people actually in the know have long been buried 6 feet under and there is little to zero evidence of what actually transpired. in my opinion, i highly suspect as do many others lho is a black ops recruit and he fer sure had a handler in the know and a backup during the assassination. he was then made scapegoat in view of the unfolding events. incompetence can only go so far, the amount we see here is at 911 levels of incompetence and maybe way beyond."

Puzzle,Inside,2023-05-19,"funny how william dafoe would have been able the escape that predicament easily, at every turn while the character he played almost died being stupid at multiple turns. shattering the glass is easy any mechanic, plumber, bikers etc would have known which material would shatter the glass with a bit of chemistry  effort to break certain things  keep throwing, breaking the door is easy well nt sure if i can say how but breaking the lock is actually not as challenging as trying to survive in the unit, surviving inside would have been easy as well water supply is not a problem nor food whether or not he had access to the freezer, he might get diarrhoea from sprinkler water  the right pipes tho. lastly, do not start that fire."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-08-10,"i wanna point out that 5800 is one of the best experiences i have ever felt in a videogame. the fact, that a loud bass blast can rip you apart is absolutely awsome. i died so often at this puzzle but i loved to see good old boy getting smashed right into my cameraangle. but the best of all is this sound desingn. the sound desingn of this passage is the best sound desingn, i have ever experienced in a computergame. but the video is so bad quality, you have to play this with bass, so you like feel the bass of this shockwave comming to kill you inside your stomace. it is absolutely brillinat and desingned with so much love and professionality. i thank you devs so much. its one of these timless games people will enjoy playing in 100 years because its one of a kind."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"i get that its netflix right and the fact that the sidemen boys can say ive got a show on netflix is pretty insane, but i feel like s1 was special because it was on youtube. like, the fact that you can watch a very high quality series made by youtubers just straight off of youtube for free was very cool. stuff like premiers having hundreds of thousands of people waiting for it, live chat reaction, sidemen boys typing in chat, everybody reacting to the whole thing on stream and videos, etc. really added to the experience. but now that its on netflix i feel like its lost the charm of s1. like dont get me wrong, its still sick, im still watching every ep, and its reaching a much more global audience, but idk, it doesnt have the same feel as s1. maybe its just my youtube bias talking lol"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-30,"so glad you played this again! i watched your inside playthrough ages ago and immediately fell in love with the game. loved all your commentary this time, really insightful and interesting to listen to. as for recommendations that are similar to inside, i don't think i have ever seen something quite like this game, but i can recommend you a few short films that have a similar vibe, or that are really cool soft scifi stories that i think you would like  la jete 1962 by chris marker  don hertzfeldt's world of tomorrow trilogy  umbra 2010 by malcolm sutherland  coda 2013 by alan holly  scavengers 2016 by joseph bennett and charles huettner  zygotte 2017 by neill blomkamp this one specifically very reminiscent of the blob from inside edit forgot to add peripheria 2012 by david coquarddassault"
Puzzle,Inside,2016-06-30,"i think it's a smart story .. if you think about it it talks about oppression and controlling from the government or anything of this kind .. the kid you play as i think he was running away from the oppression and control and turning into a controlled zombie like the ones we see .. you had a hard time running away .. but when you turned into a blob you were totally strong and took them out and you gained freedom .. the blob i guess resembles unity .. so basically the message from the game is we need to be united to fight and defeat opprression and control so we can gain freedom .. i love how the blob fell under a ray of sunshine that resembles the freedom i guess at the very end and it became completely calm and peaceful .. which means we will be calm and peaceful when we gain freedom .. i could be wrong, though"

Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-28,"my favorite explaination for the story is something i've read years ago. the idea would be that inside is a metaphor for cancer. the boy would be something that get inside a human body and try to evade the guards white cells by using the zombies worker cells to cause a tumor the blob monstruosity you control at the end. the big machine creating shockwave would be the effect of chimio, good at destroying both cancerous cells and the body. eventually offices workers doctors are able to trick you to fall of the city chirurgy to remove the tumor. the secret code used to get the second ending could be the cancer resurfacing and being able the shortcut through the body since it has already mutated and reprogramme it this way. of course this is not the confirm explaination and would love to hear different theory on the story."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-20,"from the files oswald served 15 months overseas until november 1958, most of it in japan. during his final year in the marine corps he was stationed for the most part in santa ana, calif., where he showed marked interest in the soviet union and sometimes expressed politically radical views with dogmatic conviction. oswald again fired the m1 rifle for record on may 6, 1959, and this time he shot a score of 191 on a shorter course than before, only 1 point over the minimum required to be a marksman. according to one of his fellow marines, oswald was not particularly interested in his rifle performance, and his unit was not expected to exhibit the usual rifle proficiency. during this period he expressed strong admiration for fidel castro and an interest in joining the cuban army. he tried to impress those around him as an intellectual, but his thinking appeared to some as shallow and rigid."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"after watching the second ep, i had thoughts about the number of people on the cast. i feel like, as a result, none of them have emerged as strong or memorable yet, i'm struggling to remember who all are there or something unique about them or what their strategy is for the entire thing. they're switching up a lot. pk obviously made his mark, i knew george, so i can remember him. i don't think jason has done anything, neither has cinna. mandi did okay, because she had to defend herself. mya used the token iirc. milli, whitney i don't remember getting much involved. ddg, evra for me haven't done much too, except the fact that they're cool. dylan is also kinda not fitting in. farah has not done something in a bit too. having said that, i'm waiting for them to get familiar with their role in the group and things to get more established. not judging rn, just some thoughts. also, i'd have rather seen the mafia game than the forced wedding"
Puzzle,Inside,2024-06-06,this game was the best! 13140 is my favorite part of the game because i love how it is trying to tells us that we have to go in the containment and destroy the facility that is practically using humans and trying to make a experiment about a blob that is trying to get out. first it looks like a truck has loaded a bunch of weird stuff inside it then we see 2 men in black that look like guards talking about something or plan. then we go through the ocean and get chased by a dog that is trying to kill the little kid. then we get chased by 3 or 4 men. one in a truck and one running to get me. at the end of this game it appears that we have got killed from running too fast. truly the best game ever. i hope they make a part 2 since this is not enough gameplay for a amazing game like this.will have. the game looks like we saw a weird cliff from our house and jumped leading us to a weird factory that is controlled by the government trying to keep it a serect from people so that no will know

Puzzle,Inside,2022-12-29,"okay. so, you mentioned how writers of this game are able to tell a story without talking. although i don't know a movie with that kind of writing, i do know an episode of a tv show that does that and it does it astonishingly well. i didn't even notice it the first time i watched it, and the only reason i noticed it the second time it's because at the end there is one sentence said, which got me thinking like, wait, did they just not talk?. yes i know it's just one episode, but hear me out. this is the darkest show that i have watched ever, it's about hacking first and foremost, but also about the mental state of the main character, his addiction to drugs, and the society. the most amazing element of the show for me is the fact that the main character is talking to you, the viewer. to him you are this imaginary friend that gets to see the world through his eyes. the show is called mr. robot, and i honestly can't recommend this show enough, sam esmail did such a wonderful job with it. i hope you sean see this comment and decide to watch it, but also anyone else who found this comment. have a nice day evreryone!"
Puzzle,Inside,2024-11-09,"dear bo, i know you wont see this, but i would like to communicate to you the impact that inside had on my life during and after the covid pandemic. covid started while i was ending 7th grade im 18 now, at a time when i was feeling some intense inner struggles with my mental health while also in an unhealthy certainly for a middle schooler relationship with a friend who was dealing with some severe mental health issues as well. i remember watching this special for the first time, near in the end of 8th grade when this was happening, at 3am in my closet while on the phone with my friend who had fallen asleep during a difficult conversation. i dont exactly know why, but inside really connected with me at that time and really became a comforting piece of art at that time in my life. since then, ive seen it way over 10 times, and it certainly helped me connect with something through the end of covid while i was dealing with lingering mental health issues and recovering from the bizarre quarantine way of life. for these reasons, inside will always have a special place in my heart. thank you, bo, and i hope you never stop doing what youre doing!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"icl the thing with it being on netflix and them seeming to like each episode to be 1 hour or under is already it feels like im missing out on stuff with the first episode. these people are there 24 hours a day, for 7 days. and you are cutting that down to 1 hour? i feel like the first episode should have been longer, and the last aswell. similar to season 1. so much potential with the amount of content they would have been creating, the drama we were gonna miss out on. thats what makes me wish it wasnt on netflix and was on youtube instead. you guys already are on netflix yourselves and featured in other content on there. it just seems like putting it there has taken away from the show and its content, rather than added to it or elevated it. maybe the next couple of episodes will make me go back on this, but i dont see the episodes after the first minus the finale being any longer than 1 hour. edit maybe the only way to counteract that would be doing 2 episodes a day? 1 for half there day posted at 7am, like normal and 1 later posting the other half of the day at 7pm. sticks to netflixs usual length of episodes being 1 hour each while essentially doubling the content we as consumers and netflix get. seems like a win win for everyone."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-03,"the zooms in and out of the camera are maybe related to how we approached the internet at first, it was this quirky and interesting thing, but the closer we got to it and to bo's character here the more awful stuff we ended up seeing, culminating with the close up shots of bo from different angles. then, at 138, after seeing all this we took a step back and saw the internet's mission apathy's a tragedy and boredom is a crime but, at 205, bo shuts off the lights, changes the key and speaks of the amazing beginning of this thing the blogs, the chatrooms, the sensation of the world opening to you, and how the internet's been waiting for us. the camera again starts getting closer to bo, and he adds those beautiful lights behind him, to give this heavenly impression, to show how you've put your heart and deep emotions into it once again, at 352, the internet reveals its mission, its ugly side, and we try to walk away, to escape. but the dots are so shining, the lights are so mesmerizing, and the music is going so fast that we simply can't look away. no matter how much we try to put distance between us and the internet, we're trapped with it in the room. we can't look away. just like you, right now, looking at this video and at this comment."
Puzzle,Inside,2018-05-16,"gonna post my interpretation below. i've only watched this once, so it could be totally wrong. i haven't scrutinized every second of it yet. making some extra lines so i can hide the spoilers. the whole city is a metaphor for the human body. we explicitly see areas like the heart the shockwave, the lungs the air duct, the uterus the big egg with the cranes around it. i believe the boy represents cancer. maybe not even the first bit of cancer. the people we see hunting the boy are antibodies, but he's able to sneak in by masquerading as a... good.. red blood cell? stay with me here. he gets inside. slowly, he begins to gain control of other cells, but as time passes, we can see all the evidence of the city studying and analyzing these strange beings in an attempt to manipulate and control them. this could be chemo, radiation, etc... advanced medicine. we finally see the boy join the others and become a fullblown tumor. it goes crazy in the body, destroying everything it can. when it bursts out onto the hillside, this could mean it's free to rest and grow slowly, or maybe that it's still within the control of medicine because we see that hillside in the model. in the second ending, he just heads straight for the brain in the cornfield and kills the body instantly."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-12-27,"ok this song and the animation combined is a literal masterpiece. specifically when spring trap leans back in a playful way and lurches forward as if to capture prey, is a perfect way to showcase how this truly is a fun place but then is twisted and sadistic when least expected. that combined with the lyrics was absolute beauty. second, the way freddy bounces around adds that flavor to the characters. they really are kids and entertainers. they're not just creepy. third, the rap and hard bass is gorgeous. the visuals of the massive demonic animatronic as he says bleeding and screaming sends shivers down your spine. also cg5 in the back screaming he needs to die! is a great combination! additionally when the purple guy is flashed with yellow and the camera flips and he gets into a fighter's pose with him later spinning around and waving his arms, again, shows the consistent playful nature while he does ungodly things. finally, that spin as springtrap falls into the purple, and the camera spins upside down with the way his arms are spread out, in conjunction with the music, does something to my soul and idk what, but i like it. everything has a whole was perfectly made, just an absolutely wonderful job done by everyone. coda and the animators stepped up their game and musical timing incredibly."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-05-06,"side note that whole thing about lasting 3 days without water is kinda misleading and has caused problems for people before. while it's true that your body will begin to shut down after 3 days without water, you're actually in danger much sooner than that. after 2 days without any water, your kidneys and digestive systems start to break down and cause you to be extremely weakened, slow, and in constant pain. if you don't get access to water before the third day, it's very likely that you won't physically be able to move enough to even findretrieve water to rehydrate yourself. that's why it's so important to constantly remain hydrated. regardless of what you're doing even if you're an art thief breaking into a luxury apartment to steal highdollar art, just pack some type of portable water filtration system like a lifestraw or sawyer mini. it's also important to note that if you ever get to the point of heat stroke in your life, you will become highly susceptible to it again with a lower threshold. even if you live somewhere that is cold yearround, you can still get a heatstroke, especially if you are overexerting yourself while bundled up in a bunch of coldweather gear. just remember, you are extremely easy to kill. from the weather to microbes to gunshots and more, it's easy for you to fall dead on the floor."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-05-07,"if he wanted to get out through the windows he needed to start scraping away at the edges of the panes and the sash. something has to hold them up and they are usually not particularly strong metal. even if he had scraped away at it with a knife and it took him a week or even a month, he'd get through. something he didn't think of is that he should have not eaten anything until he was pretty well into it. water is the first priorty, not food. when you eat, you waste a lot of water since it doesn't come out dry. another thing that he could have done is find a part of the floor that's carpeted or at least not covered with hard tile. from there, he could fashion a holder and start putting water from the pool into it. this would start to rot the floor making it easy to create a spot he could smash through. to counter lonliness he needed to make a doll or a dummy or even a drawing of someone he could talk to. even a poor substitute is better than none. talking to the fish would have even helped to a degree. in fact, he probably should have watched the fish, since it's said to have a calming effect on people. finally, i'd say that i'd rip out the control panel of the computer system and destroy the connections. when no signal gets to the systems they are going to shut off. if nothing else, the heatingcooling systems are down for good."
Puzzle,Inside,2023-03-11,"i saw a theory from a youtuber here in my country that makes a lot of sense with the game's history. basically the game takes place in a postapocalyptic world with humanity in extinction, which explains the absence of life outside the city. and from the state of things out there, it looks like it was recent. to rebuild humanity, the remaining humans created the monstrosity inside the laboratory, which was controlling those people we see walking in line at the beginning of the game, as there is no one using that helmet to control them there. however, at some point the monstrosity became aware of what was happening and wanted to escape the laboratory, and that's when the boy comes into action. as we can see in the secret ending, when he pulls the plug he falls and is just like the workers we control throughout the game, which suggests that he was one of them and definitely not the first that wanted to help the monstrosity, because there are other people who died in the same traps that he went through. they were probably other versions of him. throughout the game, he's always moving in a straight line, as if he knows where he's going. he could have gotten away without releasing the monstrosity, but he decided to do so. he was after the creator. you may also notice that after the girl drowns him and gives him the ability to breathe underwater, he is also able to control the workers without the helmet. it was there that the monstrosity was created, the boy gained the same powers. not to mention the fact that the workers are probably created in antigravity water. the girl must be like the workers, because they can also live underwater."

Puzzle,Inside,2023-05-06,"i would keep working at the front door. if you could cause enough damage to it first by chipping away the wood and then prying off the layers until you have mostly reached the metal surface and then hitting it with furniture in a battering ram fashion the cleaning staff would eventually notice it bulging at the least as you warp the metal door hidden within that wooden monstrosity, if you fail to pop it out entirely when it bends to the point where the locking pins no longer reach the frame or vice versa depending on the locking style. throwing the balls at the windows was actually a fairly good way to test how strong they were and would have eliminated the need to build his silvester the cat furniture tower. if the skylight glass was as strong as the glass of the windows and balcony then trying to break the frame of the balcony door would have made more sense. working at something above you is inherently worse not only because of the dust he countered but also the lack of good leverage and that's without considering how wobbly his tower was. as for the security system, the only reason it would have been messing up is because of the panel he broke, it might have been the actual computer running the system at which point removing it would stop it's function or just a ui for the system which due to it's malfunction was sending out commands to the system which was causing the temperature increase. so removing it is definitely a good idea. removing it before the temperature got too hot would have potentially kept it at a reasonable level or even deactivated the electromagnetic door locks. if not then removing it might have at least allowed you to cause a short circuit using the wires that were connected to it and thus fry the fuses connected to the security system potentially unlocking the magnetic locks which are usually made to open when without a live circuit in case of emergency. since they use electromagnetic locking rather then ferromagnetic locking. electro magnetic being magnetic only because of the live circuit with ferro magnetic being for example fridge magnets"
Puzzle,Inside,2022-06-19,"a somewhat popular, and plausible theory, is that the boy is 'controlled' by the imprisoned blob, trying to free itself from its captors. the concept of controlling humans in this game is quite prevalent too. first, it is introduced with the helmet device to acomplish a series of easy puzzles, and later this is further explored with more, and more advanced strategies required, to overcome moderatley complicated ones. this theory is also further reinforced by the fact, that the boy appears to come absolutely out of nowhere, but with a clear goal of reaching the observation labs, and the blob's cell. there seems to be no other incetive to voluntarily risk his own 'life' for making this journey otherwise. in the scripten scene, where the drowned girlsiren pulls the boy down to the depths, you can see how he is 'plugged' into something, and although it doesn't become immediately obvious, the next time that the boy interacts with the 'puppet humans', he no longer needs to wear any helmet devices please correct me if i'm wrong here for them to follow, and obey his commands aside from the fact, that he can now breathe under water that is. finally, in the area at 13746, the gallery that the blob crashes into, mirrors the final scene of the blobs 'escape', hinting at the fact, that its 'release' has been foresaw exactly to the letter. even the fact that the observation lab personel actively assists the blob supports this. when they gather at the observation area of the blob, its because they know it is highly intelligent and selfaware to the point they've anticipated all the events, following the boy's assimilation, making this a selfcontained story with the exception of the boy's innitial journey, and his attempts at disconnecting the various hidden devices along the way. i like the overall ambiguity and the 'showdon't tell' approach very much, leaving a vast room for interpretations and assumptions. the levels, their atmosphere, and the sound design, ranging from a sublime and calming tones, to suffocating no pun intended and agoraphobic droning, is breathtakingly mesmerizing."
Puzzle,Inside,2022-11-19,"i love how this trailer is put together so i thought i'd try to take a crack at what this might possibly about 008 here we get the setting which is this particular building in the center of the screen. 011 the radio audio is to either be the outside police trying to get into the locked building to capture the intruder or it's the earpiece audio the intruder the main character is receiving for instructions for this art theft heist probably additionally symbolizing communication between the outside world. 042 all the resources start to cease working which may also symbolize the feeling of desperation, panic, and crisis someonesomething would feel when they're in isolation andor danger. 107 him destroying the priceless art pieces depict the drastic change in priority, needs over wants, when in a life or death situation 113 him throwing an object at the window only for it to turn into a bird foreshadows the extreme measures one would go through just to escape a trapped in situation only to constantly keep proving the possibility of failure is unavoidable. 121 the fish sorta represents as himself in a way because fish are living in their same tank their whole lives just like how he's locked in for who knows how long but unlike him the fish gets saved and put out of misery because he kills it from it's suffering as he also benefits by having raw food which temporarily saves him until he gets worse and quite possibly dies. 126 here he talks to the pigeon saying nobody here but us pigeons which is another way of saying nobody's here but us because to him he relates to the pigeons because he believes they and him are the same for both being unimportant to everybody else. 132 he sets free the taped guy in the picture as if it was himself. 139 he draws a pigeon opening it's third eye as if him and the pigeons have a spiritual bond by mind. 148 he then spits water specifically at the third eye to show how they're both crying on the inside. 155 this is definitely a nod to willem dafoe's iconic green goblin character as they coincidentally both have a thing for going insane  205 and finally this last line where he says ..art is for keeps is what really interests me as this could possibly be foreshadowing that the owner who owns all those art pieces is purposely keeping the guy trapped for longer than needed so he can get the guy crazy enough to start making art because insane or mentally ill people tend to create the most unique abstract art. like that pigeon drawing he made on the wall that's just my thoughts tho even though i've never been to film making classes i for some reason still have an symbolic sense of understanding"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"okay so opinions on episode one i will write these out everyday in hopes of a reply from simon as he said he wont reply to anyone but i hope to provide genuinely good constructive criticism the first thing i noticed looking back over it is definitely the camera work unfortunately so far it's honestly just not as good as last year some of the shots feel slightly too zoomed in or too far out or feel crooked. it's strange.. i can't really put my finger on it yet but there is a massive difference from last year you can tell by just looking at the episodes. a big example of this is the conversation between ddg cinna and jason. the camera moved a lot more last year and was tracking people. second of all live chat and it being a premiere.. so first of all, live chat was amazing. it was the sidemen community mixed with different communities from all over..you didnt only sidemen fans spamming ws and ls it was fanum, ginges. joe wellers it was fun to feel engaged with the community even if it was just spamming something stupid and of course it being a premiere now i don't mind that its released 7am but it doesn't feel in any way really as special as it being a certain time and watching it at that time it's like if love island just released in the morning.. yay i get to watch it but you don't plan to watch for the uk it's just there when you wake up.. too add to this people have different lives and will watch at different times meaning that having a conversation about the episode is alot harder cause some people might not have seen it whereas before most people watched it live because it was at a normal time for someone to be settling down in the evening and watching something. come on guys this is like literally the one thing youtube teaches you lmao.. it's the reason you upload sidemen sundays at around 78pm its the time your audience is most active and they plan to watch sidemen sunday meaning you get more discussion and engagement the challenge was good it was funny and i was actually listening to the embarrassing moments but the only thing i will say is it did not necessarily feel like a challenge because they could have just said anything it was a bit of a gimmick but good nevertheless and cinna kind of showed this as well as jason when he said 6 figures he could have said 5  7 it wouldn't have mattered the biggest thing your fucking up is not using deprivation these people are deprived of everything supposedly and you don't give them a chance to win something in challengescrazy. all you would have to do is split people into a teams and say something like the winner of this challenge will get to sleep in these comfy beds for the night or each winning member will get their own meal upgrade which they are not allowed to share it makes people try which makes it more interesting not only this but it takes you into a major thing about sidemen videos. cheap vs expensive you get to show some of the team having a good time and the other guys pissed off cause not only have they lost money but they don't get to..sleep in comfy beds, have a nice meal,have unlimited drinks for the night, a massage you could do literally anything all the people in the new cast are good in their own way of course they are unique and i get u want different types of personalities and people from all around the world doing their own thingwhich you did have last year but i do think you have slightly missed with the uk audience like last year you also had joe weller in there ginge specs all ppl that if you knew sidemen you'd most likely be familiar with and it's not just about needing to know everyone whos going in its more about a certain personality type which we as an audience love to watch. some people who i think would fall into this category of people would be aj, mashtag, chip, willne, cole anderson and there's loads more but these are just people of the top of my head"
Puzzle,Inside,2024-11-24,"my grandpa always had a way of being there without needing to make a big show of it. he was a quiet man, not in the sense that he didnt speakhe could fill any silence with a story or a laughbut in how he carried himself. steady. solid. he was the kind of person you could lean on, the one you knew would catch you if you fell. and maybe thats why it took me so long to realize that even the strongest people arent unshakable. when i think of my grandpa, i think of someone who always gave so much of himself. whether it was to his family, his friends, or even a stranger in need, he was always ready to step up, always ready to be what others needed. he never wanted the spotlighthe never needed applause or recognition. or at least, thats what i thought. it wasnt until i heard bo burnhams all eyes on me that something shifted. i remember the first time i played it. it was late one night during the pandemic, when the days felt endless and suffocating. the isolation had started to weigh on me in ways i didnt know how to describe. that song, with its raw, aching honesty, felt like it was ripping open a part of me id been trying to keep shut. the pounding beat, the hypnotic rhythm, the desperation in bos voiceit all struck a chord. i mustve replayed it a dozen times that night. grandpa, evercurious, had wandered into my room at some point. whats that racket youve got going on? he asked with a teasing grin, the kind he always wore when he was about to lovingly roast me. its... a song, i said, fumbling for words. how could i explain something so raw and strange? its by this guy, bo burnham. hes, uh, a comedian, i guess? but its not really funny. its more... i dont know, sad? grandpa chuckled and sat down on the edge of my bed. well, play it for me. i hesitated. i wasnt sure if hed get it. but i hit play anyway. he didnt say a word the entire time the song played. he just sat there, his hands folded in his lap, his brow furrowed like he was concentrating on something far away. when it ended, i was expecting a joke, maybe something about how music was better in his day. but instead, he nodded slowly. thats something, isnt it? he said quietly. i wasnt sure what he meant, so i just nodded. its funny, he said after a moment. that feeling, like youre always performing, like everyones watching, but no ones really seeing you. i get that. i stared at him, stunned. id never heard grandpa talk like that before. over the next few weeks, that moment stuck with me. i started asking grandpa more questionsnot just about the stories he always told, but about the parts he usually left out. and little by little, he opened up. he told me about growing up in a big family where he always felt like he had to be the strong one, the dependable one. about how, when he got older, that feeling never really went away. how hed learned to push his own struggles aside because everyone else needed him to be okay. its not that i regret it, he said one evening as we sat on the porch, the sun dipping below the horizon. i dont. but sometimes... sometimes its hard not to wonder what it wouldve been like if id let myself feel a little more. if id let people see me, really see me. i didnt know what to say. i didnt know how to tell him that i had always seen him, even if i hadnt realized it until now. when grandpa got sick, everything changed. the man who had always been my rock, who had always seemed so steady, suddenly felt fragile. but even then, he tried to be strong for us. one afternoon, as i sat by his hospital bed, he reached for my hand. his grip was weaker than i was used to, but his eyes were the samesteady, kind, and full of love. you know, he said, his voice barely a whisper, ive been thinking about that song. the one you played for me. all eyes on me? i asked, surprised. he nodded. that one. theres something in it, something honest. its not just about being watched, you know. its about being alone in it all. about wanting someone to noticenot the act, but you. the real you. i couldnt hold back the tears. i wanted to tell him i noticed. that i always had. but the words got caught in my throat. all i could do was squeeze his hand and hope he understood. grandpa passed away a few days later. at his funeral, i felt like the world had gone quiet. the man who had been my anchor was gone, and i didnt know how to move forward. that night, back in my room, i played all eyes on me again. but this time, it wasnt just a song. it was a connectiona bridge to grandpa, to the things hed shared with me, to the parts of him i was only just beginning to understand. as the music swelled, i closed my eyes and let myself feel it allthe grief, the love, the weight of everything hed carried and everything hed given me. and for the first time, i didnt feel alone in it. these days, whenever i hear that song, its not just about bo burnhams pain or my own struggles. its about grandpa. its about seeing him, really seeing him, and remembering the lessons he left behind. because even when it feels like all eyes are on you, theres always someone who truly sees you. for me, that person will always be grandpa."
