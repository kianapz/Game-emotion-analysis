"This game is the best coop game I've ever played in my entire 40 couple years on this planet. I played this with my wife, who is not a gamer. Not only did this turn her into a gamer, it showed her just how amazing video games can be. Play this game with your significant other, even if they don't like games. They will after finishing this. This is about all i can muster into actual words, if you have played it, you know, if you haven't, please do yourself a favor and play it.",True,104,0,2025-02-04 02:03:40
"This game made me realize how much I love my wife because she is absolutely trash at it, and my patience is taking heavy hits on the playthrough. I guess it's supposed to be that way, and if you play this with your beloved non-gamer other half don't say I didn't warn you!",True,43,25,2025-02-05 09:08:47

"I saw so many videos of this game and thought it looked really fun but I did not realise what I was in for. This is the most innovative game I have played to date. Some games are good, some are great but this one is just so special. The levels are so creative and blew all my expectations out of the water. Just when I thought the game was coming to an end, we were taken to another phenomenal level. The movement and controls are so fun, it feels so smooth. The puzzles felt very clever and I loved working through them with my partner. It was also really fun that both characters had a role in each level, they really focused on showing that one was not better than the other; nor could one continue without the other. The story was funny and emotional at the same time, with small parts of ... darkness. I really feel at a loss for words to describe how remarkable this game is.
I could not recommend it enough!!",True,17,0,2025-01-29 00:46:33
"It Takes Two is game for - you guessed it- two. Overall experience was really nice, feeling high quality, variety of gameplay - in every chapter there is different mechanic also tons of minigames. Playing this with my partner I did have amazing, enjoyable time. HOWEVER, I didn't like the story as much as I would like to. For example - Elephant. Kill*ng with no remorse after mutil*ating her so they could make their daughter cry? Pretty traumatic scene... But I just hated the fact that they had no thoughts after. No self reflection that what they did was bad? Unnecessary? No one said they are supposed to do that. They decided that it's way to go, it gave nothing and they had no self reflection - ""oh no! we made our stressed, sad daughter cry as if her world wasn't already getting destroyed by our divorce. We are awful"". They should be dying with guilt of making their daughter suffer for no reason at all, unable to repair their mistake because of their situation.
No foreshadowing of May singing hobby, which was totally out of nowhere, also this chapter gameplay-wise was also the weakest. 
I feel like the creators had awesome idea, it started really well, but went downhill in the end. In the begining scene we see that May is working her ass off so they could have best life possible, she comes back from work and asks Cody if he took daughter to the dentist. We see that even if he is stay at home dad, May STILL has to take care of most basic sh*t. And plot twist - in the end it doesn't even change. I did enjoy them getting their spark back however my partner was first like ""damn, I'd hate to be with Cody"". Also gameplay-wise May gets more difficult stuff to do, for example garden chapter - May was supposed to support Cody's hobby of gardening. So gameplay-wise Cody was support for May's offensive XD I saw opinion that it's showing how women have to do most of the stuff and no one even notices, but I doubt that's the case. Because if it was why didn't we get gradually shifting the balance to be equal? Game was supposed to show me two people changing.

Overall - I do recommend this game as a split screen co-op game. Graphics feels high quality, variety of gameplay was a great way to go. It takes two is really enjoyable to play. However I do feel that it was rushed a little bit. As I said, idea was great, start was great, but it went downhill. Last two chapters felt much shorter and rushed - both gameplay-wise and plot-wise.",True,10,0,2025-02-12 14:39:00
"This is a good co-op game but there's a lot wrong with it that I just...I wouldn't recommend it or play it again. Maybe because I have a successful marriage that I just don't get it?? But like...man. The writing doesn't feel complete. We're constantly finding out new and random things about the couple as the game goes on that doesn't feel consistent. It also doesn't seem like they ever talked...ever. Like, May not having time to work with her hands but then we find out her hobby is singing in the last chapter? And that's cool and all, multifaceted characters, but it felt more like there were multiple writers not talking to each other. There's a part right at the beginning of the garden scene where they are kindly talking to each other and then it comes out of the cutscene and they immediately rag on each other again..but for the same topic they were just agreeing and complimenting each other about? Also, it flips play styles a lot which helps it keep fresh feeling but nothing ever felt like it lasted long enough. It would be like ""oh, cool, what a neat idea"" and then it would be over super quickly. Also there's one part where there's circles around the characters highlighting them in one singular small part where the screen is shared. and NEVER AGAIN... but there are SO MANY other puzzles, especially the clock scenes and garden scenes, where this could have benefitted because it was so hard to see the characters compared to the settings. Also, Rose just does NOT come off like an actual child. At all. She just seems like an adult pretending to be a child. Including the voice. And like...how long did they just leave Rose alone. Also, the whole game feels like a solid collaboration on the levels between players but then...you get to the final section with the music scenes and it felt like we were just waiting for one player to do what they needed to do so you could just move forward. In my opinion, the snow village and the castle sections were amazing. May and Cody felt like actual people during these sections. However, it did make me laugh that the way they were talking was making it seem like everything was hunky dory and then Rose came along. Who, I'm not dissing her at all, Rose is cool as hell as a kid. But they turn and it immediately turns into a Rose is the problem section. But also, I was fully convinced that Dr. Hakim was going to be the antagonist the whole time. I was looking forward to a boss battle where we just tore him apart. He was incredibly annoying and rude. Plus, he felt like a stereotype on top of that. The whole music section? May is legitimately uncomfortable. She didn't need pushing. Both Hakim and Cody are pushing her like WAY too much. It's really problematic. We'd have great moments and then he'd just pop up. This whole game would have been so much better if Dr. Hakim didn't exist. Also, nothing is really solved in this. At all between them. They still need to divorce. They don't talk, they didn't fix anything, it takes two but not these two.",False,5,0,2025-02-25 00:07:59

"[h1] A Visually Stunning and Ever-Changing Fantasy World  [/h1]

The game's visuals are truly stunning. While human characters may seem a bit stiff in their animations, the fact that the protagonists are dolls makes this a non-issue. The world design is especially impressive, transforming an ordinary home and garden into a massive playground full of magical elements.

From navigating giant furniture and electrical wires to exploring a toy wonderland, a snowy crystal ball world, intricate clockwork mechanisms, and a lush garden teeming with insects, the game offers a wide variety of beautifully crafted environments. These diverse settings keep the game fresh and prevent players from feeling stuck in the same location for too long.

Each level is filled with interactive objects and hidden easter eggs, enhancing the sense of exploration. There are also mini-games where players can compete against each other, adding more fun beyond the main adventure.

[h1] Brilliant Co-Op Gameplay Design[/h1]

It Takes Two is built entirely around cooperative play, and its level design reflects this perfectly. The screen is split in half, allowing both players to see their character and their partner's movements. The smooth camera transitions occasionally switch to a full-screen perspective, providing a cinematic view of the world.

Seeing both characters on the screen at all times makes it easier for players to coordinate their actions. The gameplay mechanics are also well-designed—both characters can jump, double-jump, wall-jump, dash, and ground-pound. In addition, each player receives unique tools throughout the levels, requiring them to work together to solve puzzles and progress.

For example, in an early level, May uses a hammer to break objects while Cody wields a nail gun to create platforms. Their abilities complement each other, emphasizing teamwork. Each stage introduces new mechanics, ranging from platforming and shooting to puzzle-solving, RPG-style battles, action sequences, and boss fights.

The game spans about 10–15 hours, and every moment feels fresh—there are no repetitive maps, tedious collectible hunts, or filler content. Instead, players encounter a constant stream of engaging mini-games and surprises, making the experience exciting from start to finish.

The game is also very accessible. The controls are simple and easy to learn, and the difficulty is forgiving. If one player dies, they can respawn as long as their partner is still alive. Even if both players fail, the game quickly resets at a nearby checkpoint, minimizing frustration. This makes it a great game for players of all skill levels, including those who are new to action games.

[h1] Memorable Characters, but a Simple Story [/h1]

The story follows Cody and May, a couple on the verge of divorce who are transformed into dolls. Guided by the eccentric and comedic Book of Love, Dr. Hakim, they must work together to return to their human forms.

The main cast consists of only four characters: the logical and work-focused May, the home-oriented and plant-loving Cody, their kind-hearted daughter Rose, and the over-the-top Dr. Hakim. Each character has a distinct personality, with Hakim standing out as the most entertaining. His exaggerated mannerisms and humorous antics add charm to the story.

The game cleverly integrates the couple’s struggles into the level design. For instance, a stage about their lost connection features magnet-based puzzles, while Cody’s neglected garden and May’s abandoned passion for singing become central themes in other levels.

However, the overall plot is quite straightforward, lacking major twists or deep emotional moments. While the game touches on love, family, and personal growth, it doesn’t explore these themes in great depth. That said, since the focus is on gameplay rather than storytelling, the simple narrative isn’t a major downside.",True,4,0,2025-02-10 12:30:24

"It Takes Two – Early Impressions

After playing through the first couple of bosses in It Takes Two, I can already see why this game has been praised so highly. It’s an incredibly engaging and well-crafted co-op experience that truly demands teamwork, patience, and creative problem-solving.

Every challenge so far has felt unique, with mechanics that push both players to work together seamlessly. The boss fights are tough but rewarding, requiring coordination and quick thinking to succeed. The level design is imaginative, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.

What I love most is how It Takes Two doesn’t just rely on platforming skills—it encourages communication, making it a perfect game for players who enjoy strategizing and adapting to new mechanics. The puzzles, action sequences, and humor all blend together into a fun and immersive experience.

So far, it’s been both challenging and fun, and I can’t wait to see what’s next! I almost forgot to mention that it’s fully compatible with Steam Deck too.",True,1,0,2025-02-23 08:50:34

"I played A Way Out before I played It Takes Two and I knew I wanted to play this game upon hearing it would be released.  A 2 player split-screen online co-op game is somewhat rare and I've been looking for games exactly like this.

While A Way Out was a good game, it had it issues and in some ways was a bit clunky. It Takes Two improved on all the issues it's predecessor had in every single way.  It's a great game to introduce people who normally don't game to a genre, fun settings, minigames and story. It's a experience to be enjoyed by all.",True,1,0,2025-02-18 12:50:19

"My husband and I binge played this across two days and it was 100% worth it. It Takes Two is an absolutely gorgeous game and one of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I have experienced to date.  The environments are meticulously detailed (right down to the fingerprint marks on Cody's clay face) and encourage interaction/exploration even outside of the cooperative aspect. The amount of variety this game has packed into it really does accommodate for all kinds of gamers out there. My only complaint is that sometimes the camera movements would get a bit wonky at critical moments, but thankfully the game is very forgiving if you die. 

Do not pass up this title. I managed to snag it while on sale, but it really is worth the full price tag, too.",True,1,0,2025-02-15 22:36:10

"Very nice game, me and my gf enjoyed it from start to finish. It really requires a lot of cooperation xD
The core gameplay is a puzzle platformer with a ton of minigames, but sometimes it switches to top-down shooter, 3-D action, fighting (!) etc.
I think developers purposely gave most active and damaging abilities to May (which is usually a gf-side) so most gamer-bfs would not be able to solo the game for both people.

+ nice graphics (a bit cartoonish for my style, but nice)
+ good gameplay that is various, interesting and engaging
+ minigames (can cause some conflicts tho if both people are competitive, just try to not destroy your partner's ego xD)
+ a lot of easter eggs and references


- unskippable cutscenes
- possible trusting issues afterwards :smile:

All in all i would totally recommend this game if you have a special person (with gaming experience, because playing May with gamepad could be a bit challenging) but was a LOT OF FUN",True,1,0,2025-02-08 21:21:28
"It Takes Two is what happens when a rom-com and a fever dream collide in a co-op game. You play as Cody and May, a couple on the verge of divorce, who are magically turned into tiny dolls by their daughter’s tears. (Yes, tears. Apparently, children are full of black magic.) From there, you’re forced to work together through a series of ridiculous, mind-bending levels while being coached—if you can call it that—by Dr. Hakim, a sentient self-help book who might as well be the lovechild of Tony Robbins and a mariachi band.

The gameplay is pure chaos in the best way. Every level introduces new mechanics, like flying on fidgety tools, wielding a hammerhead like Thor’s broke cousin, or straight-up engaging in a snowball fight to the death. One moment, you’re in a whimsical garden; the next, you’re fighting a squirrel who thinks it’s Batman. It’s not just a game; it’s an elaborate excuse to sabotage your partner and then say, “No, it was definitely your fault.”

The story is surprisingly heartfelt, which is impressive considering it involves psychotic vacuums and homicidal bees. It sneaks in moments of genuine reflection about relationships between all the absurdity, just to keep you emotionally off-balance. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll probably shout, “WHY CAN’T YOU JUST PULL THE LEVER?!”

Final Verdict: 10/10. Play this with someone you love, but maybe not someone you’d trust to defuse a bomb. It’s an unforgettable blend of hilarity, teamwork, and mild emotional trauma.",True,1,1,2025-02-07 23:39:16

✨ Final Verdict: A Must-Play for Any Duo
Whether you're playing with a partner, a friend, or a family member, It Takes Two is an unforgettable adventure that perfectly balances fun, challenge, and storytelling. With its brilliant design and emotionally rich narrative, it’s a game that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

One of the most memorable co-op experiences I've ever played. There's so much creativity that's so well-paced, sharing the experience with another person is an absolute blast. The story is pretty basic, but if you buy into its 90s family movie energy, it's not so distracting.

EA Play is really annoying with this version, but the Friend Pass is such a good deal that it's worth overlooking to me. Bless Hazelight for doing this.

"[h1]完美的电子童话[/h1]

能感觉到制作组在开发的许多方面都有所克制，在自己能掌控的范围内呈现出了相当理想的作品。

剧情背景是合家欢式的爱情+家庭主题，各种播片演出时长都恰到好处，一两分钟完成剧情推进和情绪渲染。

通过线性的游戏流程加上扎实的技术力，玩家能充分沉浸到作品塑造的梦境中。
游玩的时候通过抽象操作其实也测出过两三次需要读存档点的bug，但是整体的探索体验和操作手感还是很舒适。

作品从大关卡到小游戏都充斥着天马行空的想象力，堪称皮克斯的场景演出加任天堂的游戏设计。

需要两名玩家可能是这游戏唯一的缺点。

"This is a terrible game. Looks cute, puzzles are kinda fun though scripted, but the story is horrible. Do not let the graphics fool you - this is NOT worth spending money on.
The main characters are divorcing each other and the whole story is how their daughter is miserable because of her parents. They do nothing that shows they care about her - only themselves. The 'puzzle games' are all about how they learn to work together to make their poor child even more miserable and destroy her favorite things. 
We stopped playing when they started heading to rip their daughter's favorite toy apart. Reviews show that there is no way to stop this from happening and they learn nothing. I'm not going to finish this game. The main characters are ripping into each other the entire time, which was honestly not enjoyable when playing with my partner. It's not fun ribbing, it's just mean. The two main characters are mean to each other, mean to their daughter, mean to everyone they encounter. What is the lesson here?

"[h3] 10/10 Because [b] CO-LLA-BO-RATION! [/b] is everything! [/h3]

This game is the purest form of friendship, communication, and teamwork! It Takes Two isn’t a game you can play alone, and honestly, you wouldn’t want to. The real magic comes from experiencing this adventure with someone else. If that person happens to be patient, supportive, and has a great sense of humor, this game becomes something truly special.

Cody and May’s journey is about much more than just fixing a marriage. Every puzzle, every obstacle in this game requires [b] CO-LLA-BO-RATION! [/b] You constantly learn new mechanics, and the game never feels repetitive. One moment you’re playing with gravity, the next you’re having a duel with a giant squirrel. Every chapter tests a different aspect of working together.

I played as May in It Takes Two… and honestly, I wasn’t very good. I kept dying, missing jumps, and struggling with even the simplest platforming sections. But the person playing with me was always patient, never rushed me, and did everything possible to help. Sometimes, just to make me laugh, they’d do silly moves in-game to lighten the mood. And that’s why It Takes Two isn’t just a game—it’s a story about friendship and achieving something together.

The graphics are incredibly vibrant and creative. Each level feels like an entirely new experience, with unique themes and mechanics. In every chapter, there were times when we just stopped to admire the graphics. They were all crafted with incredible precision—it was impossible not to be amazed. The story has depth, the characters grow over time, and the dialogue is genuinely funny and engaging. 

In the end, It Takes Two is more than a game—it’s an experience filled with shared memories. If you’re thinking of playing it, make sure you have someone patient and fun-loving by your side. Because this journey simply can’t be completed alone. 

P.S.: I played as May and kept falling, but at least someone was always there waiting for me. Thanks mate! :)",True,3,0,2025-02-18 20:34:57

"It Takes Two is an amazing co-op game that constantly keeps things fresh. The puzzles, platforming, and combat are all designed for teamwork, and it’s a blast to play with a partner. The story is surprisingly emotional, with great humor and heart. The game looks beautiful, with creative levels that always feel new. If you’ve got a friend to play with, it’s a must-try. Highly recommend!",True,0,0,2025-02-16 15:51:56
"It's a perfect coop game and nicely fills a gap in the market. It's easy enough for non-gamers but still interesting.

"I genuinely don't understand how people can write off what happens in this game like it's okay.

The amount of disgust I feel that the only way to progress in this game is by torturing and murdering your daughters favorite toy, which mind you, is portrayed as a living creature, is horrific. They make you go through all of the motions of ripping its leg and ear off, dragging it to the edge of a cliff, and forcing its hands off the edge. All of that while you listen to her plead for her life and sob.

The fact that people say this game saved their relationship is insane to me. I get that it's just a game but you guys are psychopaths for that.

"Good long emotional story. It's going to take a while to complete so you will have something to do when you're bored. Sometimes it might feel like it's dragging on, but it's definitely worth it. Many many bosses to fight during the game and keep entertained. I wasn't expecting it to be so good, and since I got it on sale and my teammate got the free friend pass, as an 8 dollar purchase, it was one of the best story oriented games I've ever played, with so many different types of fights and puzzles to complete, you unlock cool abilities to use throughout the game. 10/10 experience.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 05:00:57

"[b]It Takes Two – First Impressions (4 Hours In)[/b]

I’ve only played It Takes Two for about four hours so far, but I’m already loving it! The scenery is absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay feels smooth and engaging. The story is both good and funny, making every moment enjoyable.

One of the best parts of the game is how much cooperation it requires—you really have to work well with your co-op partner, whether it’s a friend or a family member. There are also fun side activities, like mini-games where you compete against each other. For example, one challenge has you both trying to stay on a mechanical bull as long as possible by pressing the right button at the right time.

The game supports both online and local play, working with either two controllers or a mix of controller and keyboard/mouse. If you enjoy cooperative games with creative mechanics and a charming story, this one is definitely worth checking out!",True,0,0,2025-02-15 20:34:59
"I rarely feel like this while playing games, but this is what gaming used to feel like when I was little. This is a CO-OP masterpiece, the best I have ever played.

I never played a game where the creativness of the game is shocked me. But this time, I was shocked all along. The maps, the gameplay everything was out of this world. Every map had different mechanics, and the game played into the CO-OP part really hard.

The characters were awesome, Cody and May had deep issues with not only each other but with themselves which made this journey so relatable. The story was heartwarming(except the fucking elephant part), and I was really invested in the relationship of the main couple.

Absolute banger game, I played it with a friend, but I will play it with my future partner because this game must be experienced with a loved one at least once.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 16:46:49

"This is one of if not the best Co-op game that I have ever played in my life. It has a very strong storyline which makes the game not boring at all. With multiple themes in the game, you will be able to enjoy all kinds of gameplay as each theme requires different type of mechanism to clear the game. I highly recommend playing with a controller as well. My girlfriend bought a controller for me halfway through the game for me to try out as she was saying it really feels different and more enjoyable with it! I really should have listened to her and picked up the game with the controller right from the start. I would probably return and restart the entire game with the controller in the near future",True,0,1,2025-02-15 16:15:28

"A game that I feel obligated to comment on, just because it's SO GOOD. 

I felt all the feels playing this.. the story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The collaborative gameplay and humour made me laugh 'til I cried. 

There are some nods to other games to look out for, but you absolutely don't have to be a gamer to play this. It's a very straight forward game with the right balance of varying difficulty puzzles. 
There are also a bunch of optional minigames scattered around (good luck if you or your partner are highly competitive).

I'd also point out that you can absolutely play this with a friend. You don't have to be in a relationship to appreciate the story.

The graphics are great - the amount of detail is incredible and I love how much you can interact with the different environments. It's definitely worth taking the time to look around, rather than just blazing through objectives.

I was pleasantly surprised by how long the game was. I expected it to be a good few hours shorter.

I frequently see this game on sale, and I got it for £7. That's an absolute STEAL. 
This game is worth every penny at its full price and I highly recommend it.

"This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. 

I've heard a lot about this game over the past few years, but never really cared to look into it, up until a friend mentioned that I could play the game for free without buying it because this game has a feature to allow you to install it and play it joining a friend who owns the game. Yes, seriously. I also couldn't believe it myself.

I was so impressed with this game, I bought it on sale, despite the fact that I could have played it start to finish for free.

Without going into any details, I will say this game has a bit of a dark story and it is a rollercoaster.

The amount of detail, love and care that's gone into this game really shows, it's optimised well and I don't have any complaints. It even has MSAA x4 anti-aliasing! No DLSS fake frame upscaling nonsense, no ray tracing, and yet this is one of the most detailed games I have ever seen. I wish every game had the level of polish, love and detail of this.

"I have not played through the whole game yet, but so far It Takes Two has a cute story with interesting characters. It feels a lot like an older Pixar movie. Back when they were still good. The game has fun puzzles and environments to get through but they aren't so hard as to hold you up in getting through the story (not so far, at least). The game throws in new temporary mechanics and weapons to keep changing things up and changing up the puzzles too, which helps keep things fresh through the game.

Even though this is a game dealing with a divorce, so far the writing and voice acting hasn't felt so heavy as to affect the up beat nature of the game. And the love book character actually gives you relationship advice, throughout the game, that is good and simple advice.
