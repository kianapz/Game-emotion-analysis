Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-12,"it takes two is game for  you guessed it two. overall experience was really nice, feeling high quality, variety of gameplay  in every chapter there is different mechanic also tons of minigames. playing this with my partner i did have amazing, enjoyable time. however, i didn't like the story as much as i would like to. for example  elephant. killng with no remorse after mutilating her so they could make their daughter cry? pretty traumatic scene... but i just hated the fact that they had no thoughts after. no self reflection that what they did was bad? unnecessary? no one said they are supposed to do that. they decided that it's way to go, it gave nothing and they had no self reflection  oh no! we made our stressed, sad daughter cry as if her world wasn't already getting destroyed by our divorce. we are awful. they should be dying with guilt of making their daughter suffer for no reason at all, unable to repair their mistake because of their situation. no foreshadowing of may singing hobby, which was totally out of nowhere, also this chapter gameplaywise was also the weakest. i feel like the creators had awesome idea, it started really well, but went downhill in the end. in the begining scene we see that may is working her ass off so they could have best life possible, she comes back from work and asks cody if he took daughter to the dentist. we see that even if he is stay at home dad, may still has to take care of most basic sht. and plot twist  in the end it doesn't even change. i did enjoy them getting their spark back however my partner was first like damn, i'd hate to be with cody. also gameplaywise may gets more difficult stuff to do, for example garden chapter  may was supposed to support cody's hobby of gardening. so gameplaywise cody was support for may's offensive xd i saw opinion that it's showing how women have to do most of the stuff and no one even notices, but i doubt that's the case. because if it was why didn't we get gradually shifting the balance to be equal? game was supposed to show me two people changing. overall  i do recommend this game as a split screen coop game. graphics feels high quality, variety of gameplay was a great way to go. it takes two is really enjoyable to play. however i do feel that it was rushed a little bit. as i said, idea was great, start was great, but it went downhill. last two chapters felt much shorter and rushed  both gameplaywise and plotwise."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-10,"h1 a visually stunning and everchanging fantasy world h1 the game's visuals are truly stunning. while human characters may seem a bit stiff in their animations, the fact that the protagonists are dolls makes this a nonissue. the world design is especially impressive, transforming an ordinary home and garden into a massive playground full of magical elements. from navigating giant furniture and electrical wires to exploring a toy wonderland, a snowy crystal ball world, intricate clockwork mechanisms, and a lush garden teeming with insects, the game offers a wide variety of beautifully crafted environments. these diverse settings keep the game fresh and prevent players from feeling stuck in the same location for too long. each level is filled with interactive objects and hidden easter eggs, enhancing the sense of exploration. there are also minigames where players can compete against each other, adding more fun beyond the main adventure. h1 brilliant coop gameplay designh1 it takes two is built entirely around cooperative play, and its level design reflects this perfectly. the screen is split in half, allowing both players to see their character and their partner's movements. the smooth camera transitions occasionally switch to a fullscreen perspective, providing a cinematic view of the world. seeing both characters on the screen at all times makes it easier for players to coordinate their actions. the gameplay mechanics are also welldesignedboth characters can jump, doublejump, walljump, dash, and groundpound. in addition, each player receives unique tools throughout the levels, requiring them to work together to solve puzzles and progress. for example, in an early level, may uses a hammer to break objects while cody wields a nail gun to create platforms. their abilities complement each other, emphasizing teamwork. each stage introduces new mechanics, ranging from platforming and shooting to puzzlesolving, rpgstyle battles, action sequences, and boss fights. the game spans about 1015 hours, and every moment feels freshthere are no repetitive maps, tedious collectible hunts, or filler content. instead, players encounter a constant stream of engaging minigames and surprises, making the experience exciting from start to finish. the game is also very accessible. the controls are simple and easy to learn, and the difficulty is forgiving. if one player dies, they can respawn as long as their partner is still alive. even if both players fail, the game quickly resets at a nearby checkpoint, minimizing frustration. this makes it a great game for players of all skill levels, including those who are new to action games. h1 memorable characters, but a simple story h1 the story follows cody and may, a couple on the verge of divorce who are transformed into dolls. guided by the eccentric and comedic book of love, dr. hakim, they must work together to return to their human forms. the main cast consists of only four characters the logical and workfocused may, the homeoriented and plantloving cody, their kindhearted daughter rose, and the overthetop dr. hakim. each character has a distinct personality, with hakim standing out as the most entertaining. his exaggerated mannerisms and humorous antics add charm to the story. the game cleverly integrates the couples struggles into the level design. for instance, a stage about their lost connection features magnetbased puzzles, while codys neglected garden and mays abandoned passion for singing become central themes in other levels. however, the overall plot is quite straightforward, lacking major twists or deep emotional moments. while the game touches on love, family, and personal growth, it doesnt explore these themes in great depth. that said, since the focus is on gameplay rather than storytelling, the simple narrative isnt a major downside."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"the game is quite long, but very enjoyable. puzzles  boss fights? hell yeah  takes a lot of teamwork and concentration. heavily recommend to play the game with someone you likelove."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-23,"it takes two  early impressions after playing through the first couple of bosses in it takes two, i can already see why this game has been praised so highly. its an incredibly engaging and wellcrafted coop experience that truly demands teamwork, patience, and creative problemsolving. every challenge so far has felt unique, with mechanics that push both players to work together seamlessly. the boss fights are tough but rewarding, requiring coordination and quick thinking to succeed. the level design is imaginative, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. what i love most is how it takes two doesnt just rely on platforming skillsit encourages communication, making it a perfect game for players who enjoy strategizing and adapting to new mechanics. the puzzles, action sequences, and humor all blend together into a fun and immersive experience. so far, its been both challenging and fun, and i cant wait to see whats next! i almost forgot to mention that its fully compatible with steam deck too."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-20,great game with tons of variety in levels and mechanics
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-18,"i played a way out before i played it takes two and i knew i wanted to play this game upon hearing it would be released. a 2 player splitscreen online coop game is somewhat rare and i've been looking for games exactly like this. while a way out was a good game, it had it issues and in some ways was a bit clunky. it takes two improved on all the issues it's predecessor had in every single way. it's a great game to introduce people who normally don't game to a genre, fun settings, minigames and story. it's a experience to be enjoyed by all."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-17,"beautiful game, great visuals, good story. a truly engaging experience."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-15,"my husband and i binge played this across two days and it was 100 worth it. it takes two is an absolutely gorgeous game and one of the most enjoyable coop experiences i have experienced to date. the environments are meticulously detailed right down to the fingerprint marks on cody's clay face and encourage interactionexploration even outside of the cooperative aspect. the amount of variety this game has packed into it really does accommodate for all kinds of gamers out there. my only complaint is that sometimes the camera movements would get a bit wonky at critical moments, but thankfully the game is very forgiving if you die. do not pass up this title. i managed to snag it while on sale, but it really is worth the full price tag, too."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-15,"great story, sweet ending. idk why we didn't play it earlier. this game is a masterpiece with many references to other games and even movies like terminator 2 lol and is worth all that money and more. now we plan to play a way out, split fiction and other games from this wonderful developer. 10"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-12,"a great time playing with my lovely long distance partner, one of those games that you can actually enjoy without too much hassle without too much lag and input delay. the physics are so responsive and allows for a very fluid gaming experience. also, props to the creative game, incredible amount of effort into thinking about every level and the details in each level! if you are in a relationship, or have a really close friend to play with, this is a must!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-12,"legitimately one of my favorite games in recent memory. the value for dollar here is almost off the charts especially factoring in the friend pass. fair warning, this game will make you feel things. graphics are fantastic, game play is fun and simple enough for anyone to pick up and play, story is amazing. honest 1010."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-08,"very nice game, me and my gf enjoyed it from start to finish. it really requires a lot of cooperation xd the core gameplay is a puzzle platformer with a ton of minigames, but sometimes it switches to topdown shooter, 3d action, fighting ! etc. i think developers purposely gave most active and damaging abilities to may which is usually a gfside so most gamerbfs would not be able to solo the game for both people.  nice graphics a bit cartoonish for my style, but nice  good gameplay that is various, interesting and engaging  minigames can cause some conflicts tho if both people are competitive, just try to not destroy your partner's ego xd  a lot of easter eggs and references  unskippable cutscenes  possible trusting issues afterwards smile all in all i would totally recommend this game if you have a special person with gaming experience, because playing may with gamepad could be a bit challenging but was a lot of fun"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"i absolutely loved it takes two! everything about this game is pure brilliance, the gameplay mechanics, the art direction, the soundtrack, and most importantly, the fun it delivers. every level brings fresh and creative ideas, making the whole journey an unforgettable experience. playing this game with my daughter was one of the best gaming moments i've ever had. the cooperation, the laughter, and the emotional depth of the story made it truly special. if youre looking for a masterpiece in coop gaming, this is it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-28,"this game is phenomenal, and i am so mind blown by the huge variety of gameplay the devs packed into this experience"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-11,"great visuals, great story, great user experience. overall i had a great time playing this game with my girlfriend, it even made her cry at the end.  i strongly recommend this to everyone to try it out."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-08,"i can highly recommend it takes two. i found the game play, graphics, story and voice acting to be of middling quality. it is a frankenstein's monster of gaming genres. to list a few it has platformer, puzzler, adventure, shooter, hack and slash, rhythm, and racer elements. there are some beautiful moments, but the thing that makes it takes two shine is in the title. this game is lovingly crafted for two player cooperation. it is very friendly to novices. my wife is not a video gamer, but we completed it takes two together. in spite of every challenge, we loved it."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-25,"this is a good coop game but there's a lot wrong with it that i just...i wouldn't recommend it or play it again. maybe because i have a successful marriage that i just don't get it?? but like...man. the writing doesn't feel complete. we're constantly finding out new and random things about the couple as the game goes on that doesn't feel consistent. it also doesn't seem like they ever talked...ever. like, may not having time to work with her hands but then we find out her hobby is singing in the last chapter? and that's cool and all, multifaceted characters, but it felt more like there were multiple writers not talking to each other. there's a part right at the beginning of the garden scene where they are kindly talking to each other and then it comes out of the cutscene and they immediately rag on each other again..but for the same topic they were just agreeing and complimenting each other about? also, it flips play styles a lot which helps it keep fresh feeling but nothing ever felt like it lasted long enough. it would be like oh, cool, what a neat idea and then it would be over super quickly. also there's one part where there's circles around the characters highlighting them in one singular small part where the screen is shared. and never again... but there are so many other puzzles, especially the clock scenes and garden scenes, where this could have benefitted because it was so hard to see the characters compared to the settings. also, rose just does not come off like an actual child. at all. she just seems like an adult pretending to be a child. including the voice. and like...how long did they just leave rose alone. also, the whole game feels like a solid collaboration on the levels between players but then...you get to the final section with the music scenes and it felt like we were just waiting for one player to do what they needed to do so you could just move forward. in my opinion, the snow village and the castle sections were amazing. may and cody felt like actual people during these sections. however, it did make me laugh that the way they were talking was making it seem like everything was hunky dory and then rose came along. who, i'm not dissing her at all, rose is cool as hell as a kid. but they turn and it immediately turns into a rose is the problem section. but also, i was fully convinced that dr. hakim was going to be the antagonist the whole time. i was looking forward to a boss battle where we just tore him apart. he was incredibly annoying and rude. plus, he felt like a stereotype on top of that. the whole music section? may is legitimately uncomfortable. she didn't need pushing. both hakim and cody are pushing her like way too much. it's really problematic. we'd have great moments and then he'd just pop up. this whole game would have been so much better if dr. hakim didn't exist. also, nothing is really solved in this. at all between them. they still need to divorce. they don't talk, they didn't fix anything, it takes two but not these two."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-18,"h3 1010 because b collaboration! b is everything! h3 this game is the purest form of friendship, communication, and teamwork! it takes two isnt a game you can play alone, and honestly, you wouldnt want to. the real magic comes from experiencing this adventure with someone else. if that person happens to be patient, supportive, and has a great sense of humor, this game becomes something truly special. cody and mays journey is about much more than just fixing a marriage. every puzzle, every obstacle in this game requires b collaboration! b you constantly learn new mechanics, and the game never feels repetitive. one moment youre playing with gravity, the next youre having a duel with a giant squirrel. every chapter tests a different aspect of working together. i played as may in it takes two and honestly, i wasnt very good. i kept dying, missing jumps, and struggling with even the simplest platforming sections. but the person playing with me was always patient, never rushed me, and did everything possible to help. sometimes, just to make me laugh, theyd do silly moves ingame to lighten the mood. and thats why it takes two isnt just a gameits a story about friendship and achieving something together. the graphics are incredibly vibrant and creative. each level feels like an entirely new experience, with unique themes and mechanics. in every chapter, there were times when we just stopped to admire the graphics. they were all crafted with incredible precisionit was impossible not to be amazed. the story has depth, the characters grow over time, and the dialogue is genuinely funny and engaging. in the end, it takes two is more than a gameits an experience filled with shared memories. if youre thinking of playing it, make sure you have someone patient and funloving by your side. because this journey simply cant be completed alone. p.s. i played as may and kept falling, but at least someone was always there waiting for me. thanks mt!"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,amazing!! played with my 10 year old daughter and she was more than capable of doing the challenges....... fantastic story line and would highly recommend ..... now to buy the sequel!
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"mechanically i could see this being interesting but it felt very repetitive even very early on, it was at the very least not fun or engaging enough to make me sit through the two main characters broken relationship. who want to sit through two parents constant bickering and arguing? they should not be a couple, they should be allowed to get their divorce and i cannot understand why the game paints that as a bad thing. staying together for the kids is not a good concept and unfortunately it overshadows ans spoils whatever gameplay is here. it is not fun and i cannot see myself finishing the game. if i had played less than 2 hours i would have returned it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"excellent coop game that combines a fun story with creative gameplay. the price is fair for the contentstory, especially with the friend pass, which lets you share the game with a friend so only one person needs to buy it. while some moments can be tricky, they add to the challenge and never feel impossible. pretty much everything is easily manageable with a little teamwork. i finished it once a long time ago, and playing through it a second time is still just as enjoyable."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"playing it takes two with my partner, from start to finish, we were completely hooked. the games unique concept, creative puzzles, and constant variety in gameplay kept us engaged the entire time. every level felt fresh. the way it takes two blends humor, heartfelt moments, and challenging puzzles made it an unforgettable experience. the characters were charming, the story was surprisingly emotional. becoming so immersed in the game that we completed it in what felt like record time, every session left us wanting more. it was the perfect way to spend quality time together, and the coop mechanics were seamless and fun. we genuinely enjoyed every minute of it, i personally couldn't recommend this game enough, to either any couple that wants to play it, or friends that enjoy coop games, its one of the games, i would recommend immensely to people, both me and my partner are waiting to play split fiction next, the newest of the games from this company, i believe we are both looking forward to it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"it takes two isn't just a good coop game it's a genuine experience. from the moment you start, it's clear this game is something special. you and a friend or partner, or family member step into the roles of may and cody, a couple facing a tough time, and the game weaves their story into a wildly creative adventure. what makes it stand out is how every level is so meticulously designed and feels like a completely new game. each area introduces fresh, surprising gameplay mechanics that keep you constantly engaged. one minute you're wielding hammers and nails, the next you're navigating a snow globe or piloting a plane. the variety is truly impressive, and the visuals are consistently beautiful, making each level a treat for the eyes. the way the game ties its narrative to the gameplay is brilliant. you're not just playing through levels you're actively participating in may and cody's journey, and the challenges you face together mirror their relationship struggles. it's a clever and heartfelt way to tell a story. if you're looking for a game that's fun, engaging, and genuinely different, it takes two is a mustplay. it's the kind of game that creates lasting memories, and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing with others. just grab a friend and dive in  you won't regret it."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"wonderful experience for a couple to enjoy. even with a friend it's fun  though perhaps not as intimate? the colors, the music, the narrative told through conceptual level design, the cooperative experience, it all comes together. sometimes it reminds me of a string of mario party minigames following each other up. definitely recommend this game, you won't regret it. collaboration!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"really fun game with lots of fun elements sewn into the game. explore while playing the game to find all the minigames. but the best part of the game is how you need to be synchronized with your partner during gameplay, really good concept and i wish there where more of this type of games!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"it takes two is a beautifully crafted game that tells a very important story, especially for parents. i wasnt lucky enough to have a female best friend to play with, but i managed to find an appropriate replacement. the gameplay is fun, never becomes dull, and keeps you glued to your chair. the puzzles are not complicated, except for the helltower, which was really frustratingbut since its optional, it gets a pass. i would recommend everyone to try this game with their better half or a friendyou wont regret it!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"played this with the gf high, highly recommended. the game has a unparalleled level of creativity. the story is well written, felt like a movie. the devs clearly took their time and poured alot of love into this masterpiece. you kinda get two games in one. this game has as many mini games as a mario party game which is why its staying installed on my system. alot of games that have mini games as bonus they are kinda just thrown in there with no thought or effort but all of the mini games here are well implemented fun and fleshed out."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-08,"haven't finished this yet, but have more than 6 hours in it with my wife. absolutely amazing game. and a very novel concept if done for the first time because i have never played a game like this before. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it with their significant other or their best friend. you can't play this without another person on your team and that is the distinction of this game. this game has a split screen gameplay and kinda disorienting at first. but i got quickly used to it. come to think of it, it is the point of the game and i wouldn't have it any other way. you see the pov of your partner along with yours and really helps coordinate or help out each other if stuck solving something in game."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-06,"it has a great variety of gameplay, setdressing and ideas to tackle. definitely a must play if you yearn for a coop play, be it with your friend or loved ones. it can be problematic to setup online connection at first we've used ea servers, since through steam it didn't quite work somehow. only major gripe is that the story cuts off abruptly. it could be better, of course. you are left with a satisfying conclusion though! still, it's more of a yes than no!"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-04,"y'know, when this game was getting a bunch of game of the year accolades the year it came out, i scoffed a little. some colorful coop game that was supposedly the highlight for a bunch of people was just kind of off putting for whatever reason... but after several years, i thought my wife and i might have a good time with it since we were enjoying some split screen donkey kong on the old wii. this game was split screen so i said what the heck. i didn't expect the game to be this good. i could write more about the game's content, but i won't. what i will say is i personally don't throw around the word masterpiece often for many games. but this is definitely one of those titles. it is a phenomenal video game that had me giddy from start to end. an absolutely incredible experience.  also... i ran this on a docked steam deck with a wireless usb xbox 360 controller plus some janky bluetooth controller doing split screen on a 55inch television. not an ounce of problems with this setup."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-25,"incredible game overall. my girlfriend and i we had a amazing time finishing this game together. it's fun, challenging, beautiful and wholesome. the phases kept surprising us with a insane diversity of environments that would bring new mechanics and different bosses at the end of every level, most being quite challenging. we only had a problem with the sound in which the voices during cutscenes would just not work, that was sad, but the subtitles saved the game, and was just only towards the end. overall beautiful game."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-25,"its cute, not too difficult to figure out, def a good game for couples. if i'm being honest though. i wish the very last part was a choice driven option. either have rose cry or have them kiss and make up. one ending is they still get divorced another is they stay together. because even through trials and tribulations couples sometimes do better separate then together. thats just me though liking multi choice games and looking at a reality aspect of it. but how the game is i overall recommend it for its story, long game play hours and atmosphere"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-24,"this game is a 1010. recommend for anybody who has a friend to play with. it feels a bit long, but honestly with all the new mechanics on each level, it doesn't get boring. graphics are amazing, game isn't buggy, soundtrack is awesome, puzzles aren't so easy they are boring, but not too hard that they aren't fun, just right. boss battles are hard enough to be fun as well. i would say this game is just right in pretty much all aspects, would and will likely play again."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-20,a game with a really nice vibe with multiple minigames and challenges that can be hard enough to be entertaining for the seasoned gamer while still manageable for the novice player. although there are some core mechanics of traversing the different maps some come with additional tools which keeps the game fresh all the way towards the finishline. while the game at some points can be hard dying is not made punishing which makes it the perfect trial of fire for your relationship.

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,"so far a sound game, graphics and everything is really nice definitely worth the money"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-05,excellent coop game with variable gameplay. online coop is finicky but doable.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,"the gameplay is fun, the story is infuriating. the teddy bear massacre was pretty fucked up and the lack of reflection on that was pretty rough, but the whole time it was just a divorce caused by cody whinging constantly about may and may having to defend herself. it was so frustrating that the story kept trying to pressure them into getting back together when divorce is clearly the right answer. they have nothing going for them and cody has an inexplicable grudge against may. cody is a nature person but with no application of such, may is the one who has to do the watering and weeding. cody complains that she doesn't support his hobby when she bought a whole ass house just so he could have a garden. may is working overtime to support the family. she have up her hobbies to work overtime while fitting in play with her daughter. you'd think cody would like be characterised at the stay at home husband but the story never shows him doing it correctly, his character never does anything right or have anything going for him. may is just constantly demanded that she lift heaven and earth for this dude who doesn't even like her. the story presenting their sides as even is unfair and fucked up."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-24,"it took two... i started this game with my girlfriend of three years who i later found out after proposing the idea of marriage had cheated on me. our relationship wasn't perfect in that we often had different viewpoints in life or disagreements. we ended up breaking up before only to reintroduce things and in the end to reintroduce the relationship for a second time i turned it down. while i knew it was the best thing for me moving forward it was one of the hardest things i ever had to do in my own pursuit to find love. the hardest thing to do is accepting you care about someone even after being betrayed, but realizing that things just aren't meant to work out and that it's ok to experience this. in it takes two your focus is to sorta rebuild a failing relationship. i think similar to the story from the game, you must also accept that things may not work out and in order to find someone you do love you have to come to terms with your own shortcomings as a person. i finished the game with someone who i believe i can see a life with .... only time will tell"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-21,"this is the most frustrating game in the entire universe. my 10 year old daughter has adhd and cannot get the timing right for the jumping and swinging on the nails we have been playing for 11 hours and have not got past the toolbox bossfight in the first chapter! and finally we got lucky and she was so happy to have got past the first stage in the fight, only to die in the second stage, and have to go back to the start. why? why not just send us back to the second stage? why would we want to do the same thing 5 billion times?? how is that fun?? if you had to read the same chapter of a book 20 times in order to get to the second chapter, would anyone read??? someone for the love of god create a mod that lets you skip fights after you fail 10 times in a row. and by the way we failed about 50 times in a row before she started crying and i gave up. games are supposed to be fun, not make you cry"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-19,"this is a terrible game. looks cute, puzzles are kinda fun though scripted, but the story is horrible. do not let the graphics fool you  this is not worth spending money on. the main characters are divorcing each other and the whole story is how their daughter is miserable because of her parents. they do nothing that shows they care about her  only themselves. the 'puzzle games' are all about how they learn to work together to make their poor child even more miserable and destroy her favorite things. we stopped playing when they started heading to rip their daughter's favorite toy apart. reviews show that there is no way to stop this from happening and they learn nothing. i'm not going to finish this game. the main characters are ripping into each other the entire time, which was honestly not enjoyable when playing with my partner. it's not fun ribbing, it's just mean. the two main characters are mean to each other, mean to their daughter, mean to everyone they encounter. what is the lesson here? you can have fun while making torturing everyone around you and making them miserable? 010, would refund if i could. the stupid elephant scene is way past the refund point. poor rose needs different parents. get a different puzzle game  do not waste your money on this trash. it is not even worth the sale price  do not spend 40 on this pile of shit."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-26,"story has a very dark side to it, whoever wrote this needs therapy. tried to play it with my son but had to stop part way through. don't let the playful graphics fool you, the character's actions are sick and twisted. completely ruins the game for me. the actual gameplay and puzzles left a lot to be desired as they were very obvious and one dimensional. feels like you are just going through the motions between cutscenes."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-18,"this is a good game but make sure whoever ur playing with is competent because if they dont know the difference between left and right,,"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,"was super stoked to find this game on sale, so i bought it, phoned a friend and loaded up for some entertainment... then the game kept crashing. tried reinstalling, verifying game files, updating device drivers, etc. i have a fully capable pc with a 3060ti video card. i could never make it past the first cut scene. didn't get a minute of actual game play out of this purchase. i did get massively frustrated and wasted 3hrs of my life with the install and troubleshooting though. wish i got to try it as it looks like a fun one... but with whatever compatability issues i was facing, i cannot recommend"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-14,literally so fun but wish it was longer!!!! my boyfriend and i have lowkey sped through this but we for sure will be playing split fiction. while there are challenging parts i think this is a great game even if you aren't a gamer
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"the game is still the game, but the one whom i once played with has not been by my side any longer a great game, just the story is kinda sad."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"the game is as cute as it looks, so far. although, i wish there were more perks for exploring than there is. the world seems a bit straightforward. if you're a parent reviewing for your kid, dialogue is a bit more mature than what the animation could lead one to anticipate."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"it takes two is a great game to play with your friend or significant other. the main thing to keep in mind is if your partner isn't familiar with the controls of a 3d platform game, then you'll need to have patience."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-09,"so i finished this game with my friend and i gotta say it was one of the best experiences we ever had... hands down. we even saw the promotion for split fiction and bought it the moment we could and are already playing it and having an awesome time. great games to enjoy with family and friends, the coop experience is on another level."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-08,"fun, controls are a bit hard to pick up but its good"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-07,"my wife and i played it, and it was so much fun! i bought a copy of the game and my wife used the free friends pass. there was a little bit of an issue figuring out the steamea play online stuff, but we got it worked out pretty quickly. we played over steam, that seemed to give us the best experience. gameplay isn't complicated, but very fun. i would recommend this game to anyone. 1010. co la bor a tion!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-07,"honestly, i have to say that this game is fantastic. i truly appreciate every aspect of itthe storyline, the sound, the graphics, and even the humor, which is spot on and so relatable. it's definitely one of the best games i've played the minigames and achievements are all wellorganized, and there's one chapter in particular that had me both laughing and surprised, especially with the elephant puppet."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-07,"it takes two is a oneofakind coop experience that brings together fun, creativity, and heart in ways that few games can match. i originally started playing it with my wife, and though we didnt quite finish, we were really enjoying the journey. but when the friends pass came out, i thought itd be a great chance to share the game with my little brother, and that turned out to be one of the most memorable gaming sessions ive had. we dove in and completed the entire game in one go, taking breaks only for food and the occasional bathroom break. over the span of 11 hours, we laughed, shouted, and highfived our way through a rollercoaster of unique and exciting gameplay challenges. the mechanics in it takes two are constantly evolving, with each chapter offering something new. the games ability to surprise and delight with innovative gameplay sequences kept us on our toes, and we never felt like we were doing the same thing for too long. what really stands out, though, is how well the game handles coop. every puzzle and challenge is designed to require two players, which means you need to communicate and work together in clever ways. its a perfect bonding experiencewhether its with your spouse, sibling, or friend. the emotional beats of the story, while initially quirky, add depth and create a surprisingly heartfelt narrative about love, relationships, and working through tough times. in the end, it takes two is a masterpiece of coop gaming. its one of those rare games thats as fun as it is meaningful, with tons of personality and charm packed into every level. if you have someone to play with, this is an experience you dont want to miss. i highly recommend it, whether youre playing with a partner, a sibling, or a friend."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-06,"the game is absolutely amazing! i played the entire game with my girlfriend, and we had a blast, and i can't wait to get split fiction and play through that as well!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-06,i played this game with my friend and this was one of the best games i've played in a long time. we had so much fun playing it. the amount of creativity poured into this game is just mind blowing. props to the devs for making such a great game.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-05,"h1it's worth the money!h1 the best coop game i've ever played. a real masterpiece! the attention to detail and the enormous effort put into the game are clearly noticeable. it didn't feel like an ordinary game, but more like an interactive movie in which you play the leading role with your buddie."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-04,"there are games and there are works of art. this is b both b. i am an outright hater of ea and other money guzzling giants like ubisoft but this is like finding a perfumed hand sanitizer in a sea of cow turd. unexpected and lovely altogether. it is precisely this game that reflects what i feel the giant publishers should invest in. art. they already have money. i know, i investors and shareholder meetings and bla bla bla i. anyway. this game moved me. it brought my relationship with the love of my life even closer. it was relatable. from past relationships and from my childhood. this is a masterclass in creativity, playability, optimization, fun and learningreflecting. the friend's pass is absolutely brilliant. i have no negative points to outline except for the love book, which gets to be a bit too much by the end. i love this. i love this like i love baldur's gate 3. like i love god of war, skyrim, donkey kong country snes. it takes two does not evoke the same feeling as these games, but it evokes the idea of being seen  of existing. spoiler as someone who went through a rough parent's divorce at 14, who thought i was at fault for causing their breakup and now thinks i was at fault for my mother enduring suffering from my father way longer than she should have, this game evokes the loneliness and exclusion i felt. but this is not a child's story. this is a couple's story. and a falling out of love's story. and a menacing rut's story. my partner resonated deeply with may's losing of her music and it has been a topic we have been working on lately. this helped a lot. spoiler this is a reflection on how normalcy is overlooked and repetitiveness gets replaced in its stead. i felt deeply the falling out of love, but it hurt me to face the fixing of such bond, whereas i could not. i felt deeply the joy of rebuilding a bond so strong, it makes the world have color and be playful and lighter. this game has a childlike comedic vibe, but it is definitely not immature. i sincerely thank the creators, devs, testers, actors and crew not ea, fuck them for bringing so many emotions in such a fun and diverse game. i endorse this experience and recommend to all who want to have a load of fun and to reflect. spoiler benis spoiler"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-20,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaah masterpiece! my husband n i play it often and it's probably one of my favorite things to do, i'll be sad when it ends what's impressive is how many mechanics the game actually introduces each chapter and even if ur really sharp, sometimes it takes time to figure stuff out. also game's literally what it's called but you often catch urself forgetting about that and i try really hard on ur own i but the answer to anything simply takes two. always. worth the cash, genius"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-23,"game felt rushed towards the end and the elephant deserved more attention, and care than the plant in the garden."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-19,its not difficult and just seems like a mindless play through and the story is boring
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"it takes two has a charming story, but its simplistic gameplay and non existent difficulty makes it a bore if you have any gaming experience."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-23,"h1i found it quite boringh1 this game is developed by monkeys, it takes so much space and gpu power that even on top end bit can be unplayablelaggyb, the game play is average and similar to something like angry birds, only the background is changing. compared to other coop game it is not that great best for me is unravel two for example."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-23,"the game makes the male do the most unfun and simplistic gameplay, they made him stubby and fat for some reason and made him the butt of the joke. the plot was so bad, i cant imagine they used more than 15 minutes to write it. the little girl varies from age mentality 6 years old to around 15? very cringe. the female is rude, can never say thank you or be at fault. its crazy i even cared about this game enough to leave a review.... my gf did enjoy the gameplay though so if you want something for you and your partner, it may be worth the buy."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"mechanically i could see this being interesting but it felt very repetitive even very early on, it was at the very least not fun or engaging enough to make me sit through the two main characters broken relationship. who want to sit through two parents constant bickering and arguing? they should not be a couple, they should be allowed to get their divorce and i cannot understand why the game paints that as a bad thing. staying together for the kids is not a good concept and unfortunately it overshadows ans spoils whatever gameplay is here. it is not fun and i cannot see myself finishing the game. if i had played less than 2 hours i would have returned it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-27,"shitty game, sucks. boring and shitty pacing. the game takes you by the hand the whole time this game is not for real gamers  lmao"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-18,"its a decent game just so you know, it takes only two living humans to beat the game!? that's crazy if i have five apples and my mother does one pushup then how fast drives a car between london and my brain i'm at a payphone, trying to call home all of my change, i spent on you where have the times gone? baby, it's all wrong where are the plans we made for two? steve wozniak"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,"imagine if instead of cody, you played as lowtiergod and instead of preventing a divorce and sit on your a and played smash in your lowincome house"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,"this was wholeheartedly one of if not the best game i have ever played. the creators took some real time and effort into the creation of this, and it is a masterpeice of video games. the storyline is sad, sweet, funny, and all in all really interesting. there are so many game elements stacked into this game, including fighting, parkour, puzzles, and mass hating on a book. this was so fun to play and was packed with laughs. i enjoyed screaming and laughing with my playmate. took 15 hours to complete, and i'm so sad its over. this is worth a million dollars. if i could recommend any game, it would be this one."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-16,that's how you design a game for a pair of loving people. gained a girlfriend because of this. highly recommend.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-15,"awesome coop game, more studios in the market should follow this approach. it was a lot of fun"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-14,"my partner and i have wanted to get married for some time now and we were a bit stagnant on the timeframe. this year... next year... logistics... but randomly we were hanging out and i suggested to play a game together she is not a gamer girl. anyways i stumbled upon this and read reviews together, and were sold to try it out. next day we have our wedding day planned and invites out. who would have thought a video game would be the kick in the butt we needed to get married already!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-13,pretty fun until you and your girlfriend break up and now you can't finish the game

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-07,"this game was so much fun. the blend of whimsy and serious emotional themes makes this one of my favorite games of all time. however, i will not play through it again due to how i feel about a certain scene involving a certain stuffed elephant."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-04,"i started playing this game with my best friend who also happened to be my crush with no genuine hopes that they would ever like me back, and ended it with them as my significant other, and a deep and completely irrational hatred for a certain red book with an ornate heart on the front. 1010 changed my life, would escape the friend zone again."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-03,"i done everything with my ex boyfriend for this game i love it, and also had a sad story for 2 years, i just found out he was a widower with 1 son, that's not the problem, but there were a lot of lies going on then i decided to break up yeyeyyeeye so happy cause he is a parasite"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-27,"thanks a lot everyone. i appreciate you making it free for a 2nd player to join the game. my brother and i really enjoyed this and managed to beat it in about 22 hours. that's 22 hours of my brother and i squawking at at each other over discord. we both enjoy trying to solve the puzzles and cursing out our mistakes. i'd say the story and acting where good but it got really dark in some places and feel bad for how the first boss was defeated. the graphic where really pretty and ran better once i got the graphics settings optimised. i like how the game lent itself to some exploration despite being fairly linear. each chapter could be a full game on it's own as the gameplay changed between chapters. the main issue we had was trying to play the game over the internet as there was a lot of syncing issues that occurred that caused us both to see different things.. it was resolved by us using steam's play together feature that allowed my bro see all the same stuff as me. we nearly got softblocked twice with a monster spawn camping my brother and a particular door that had me respawn weirdly. we beat the odds anyways and beat the game. overall, very highly recommended. i'll be making a video compilation of my livestreams of the game."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-27,awesome! a lot of fun to play with my girlfriend. 1010
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-20,"an unforgettable coop experience, crafted with love and passion! i'm playing it takes two with my partner, and it's absolutely perfect for two players with different levels of gaming experience. the game seamlessly blends various genresplatformer, rpg, shooter, and adventurekeeping every moment fresh and exciting. the challenges, puzzles, and boss fights are incredibly creative and welldesigned. each section introduces new mechanics that feel intuitive yet engaging. the checkpoint system is smartly implemented, ensuring just enough setback to keep the game thrilling without becoming frustratingespecially for my girlfriend, who is less experienced in gaming. overall, it takes two is a masterpiece of coop gameplay, offering a fun, emotional, and rewarding experience. highly recommended!"

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-15,every girl i played this with broke up with me barely halfway into the game. this is no coincidence. the core mechanics of this game are not fun and are meant to invoke frustration. i love coop games but this isn't it.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-26,disgusting yet ultra casual game! made by freakin' sadistic perv! just google an elephant episode.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-17,"i was really really enjoying playing this game with my best friend  lots of laughing fits and such... until a particular scene happened that made me want to vomit, hurt myself, close the game, uninstall it and never touch it again. oh if it's giving you a strong emotional reaction, that means it's good art! fuck you. being genuinely traumatized is not what i signed up for here."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-08,"played this game with a friend one night, laughed so hard, it felt just right. puzzles, jumps, and fights so grand, only worked with a helping hand. co lla boration was the key, fail alone? thats on me. bosses wild, the levels new, no dull moment, not a few. a tale of love, a game of fun, by the end, we werent done. if youve got a friend to play, get this gamedont delay!"
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-28,the elephant scene is so fed up. i would never recommend this game to anyone.

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-17,best coop game so far. really good writing. extremely creative job done here. a band of applause ought to be in order.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-05,"i got this game for me and my 6 year old son to play together, and i was a little bothered by the giant size of the game, but what ever. it was a bit slow on my pc, which was also strange because it didn't look amazing or anything, but then the bad part was the story. it's about a couple, like me and my son's mom, who are happily married, wanting to get a divorce and split up. it feels like the kind of game a divorced dad would get to do something with his kid on the weekends he has them. then in the game itself, it was so frustrating for me, and especially for my son. it had a bit of fun in being tiny going through a big world, but did not make up the pain we had to go through in the lengthy storylines and bad graphics that used up all my pcs power."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-10,"this game is way over priced, poorly optimized, runs like crap, it's full of game breaking bugs, there's almost no guidance or hints as to the solution to some of the levels so you have to pause it and go look up a tutorial. i wish we never bought this. don't waste your money on this."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-03-15,"the writes went way off course about half way. goes from a nice fun coop game to wtf, why did i just play this and why did i spend money on it."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-28,this game blew all my expectations out of the water.
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-28,"i am a straight man who had to play this with my buddies, a thing that i believe will be faced by most individuals reading this. my condolences. jokes aside, it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. maybe because somewhere in between my mind just stopped giving a . the story is clich and boring af. i know it targets a very specific demographic but even then i felt it being too repetitive. a classic hero's journey trope, except not written very competently. i wouldn't say more about it to prevent spoilers i guess. and it may not bother you as much, as i have seen many of my friends liking it. looking past that cesspool of frustration, the game is rather charming and a fun 2player coop. the level designs were great, the challenges felt satisfying to complete albeit a bit too easy for the hardcore platformers. i believe that's for a reason since it will be a good entry for all the nongamers out there. the game by itself should not cause any frustrations between the players, apart from the story,  that... i digress. on a positive note, it almost reminded of the times of splitscreen, gaming on the crt with friends after school. of couse its not quite that legendary but regardless of all its quircks, it still feels like that in a weird way. overall recommended. certainly doesn't hurt to give it a try when on sale."
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-28,one of the best coop ever and ive played many for last 20 years. play this with close friend or partner. very memorable

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-24,game is good but it has a bug where the other player can't join when playing online when i searched for solution online a lot of people are facing the same issue ea fix please
Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-24,"i have played through this game twice with my friend, the first time after he picked it up around the holidays for really cheap, and i really loved the teamwork, humor, and puzzle solving. the art style and music is amazing and the story is spectacular. i picked up the game when it was on sale to play through it again with him and achievement hunt. that is the nice thing about this game, only one person needs to own the game to play, however, you cannot obtain achievements on the friend's pass, so it's something to consider if you are a completionist. if you struggle with migraines and flashing lights, you may want to be cautious with this game as there are chapters that can be really intense. for example there is a section in the third chapter where you enter a kaleidoscope that has a lot of bright lights and broken images. the last chapter has a lot of bright, fast moving lights and colors as well."

Puzzle,It Takes Two,2025-02-22,"lets play it takes two together! we grew up side by side, and even though life has pulled us in different directions, she still pops up now and thenjust like alwayspulling me out of the monotony of daily life. this time was no different. with a reluctant sigh, i agreed. as soon as the game started, we exchanged knowing smiles, chose our characters, and dove into that whimsical world. it was just a virtual adventure, yet each challenge felt as vivid and real as life itself. the first level demanded teamwork to overcome obstacles. she was always the nimble one, landing jumps with precision and speed, while i lagged behind, fumbling and making mistake after mistake. she chuckled at my struggle but waited patiently. dont be so clumsy, idiot. ill step on the mechanism for you! she teased. and in that moment, i couldnt help but smile to myselfthis familiar rhythm between us was like stepping back into childhood, where we played side by side without a care in the world. later, we found ourselves piloting a plane together. i took the controls while she battled incoming enemies. the chaos quickly escalated into frustration. can you be more careful? she huffed. hey, arent you supposed to handle the enemies? i shot back. just as our bickering threatened to cost us the level, she suddenly laughed. forget itlets try again. i believe in you this time. i froze. i believe in you. those simple words sent a warmth rushing through me. hadnt this always been the essence of us? no matter how much we bickered, no matter the challenge, she never doubted me. when we finally conquered the game, we highfived, grinning like kids. she turned to me with that familiar, confident smile. see? were still the best team. looking at her, i was suddenly flooded with memoriesof the years we had spent growing up together, from childhood mischief to this moment, fighting side by side once again. this gaming journey was more than just play it was a reminder that no matter how much time passes, some bonds never fade. that night, i didnt just win a gamei rediscovered something far more precious. maybe the best part of life isnt about where you go, but about having someone who will always take the journey with you."
