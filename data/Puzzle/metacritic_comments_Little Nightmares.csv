TrueMiracle,2025-02-03,80,"Little Nightmares est un classique des jeux ""indés"". Il arrive à nous tenir en haleine pendant toute la durée du jeu grâce à une histoire énigmatique et étrange qui ne laissera personne de marbre. La direction artistique originale et les musiques mêlant des tonalités angoissantes ainsi que des mélodies enfantines et féeriques, nous permet de plonger au sein d'un univers tragique rempli de mystères . La protagoniste de notre histoire s'appelle Six, c'est une enfant attachante et innocente mais qui montre un tempérament parfois plus nuancée dans le jeu. Ce contraste de personnalité dépeint une certaine complexité dans son design. Tout n'est pas tout blanc, tout n'est pas tout noir dans un monde ou tout paraît si sombre. L'univers et les descriptions des personnages sont volontairement laissés cryptique, ce qui permet au joueur de laisser place à son imagination pour créer ses propres théories concernant le monde de Little nightmares. J'ai beaucoup aimé le gameplay. Les créateurs ont reussit à mélanger habilement le plateforming avec un jeu d'énigmes qui ne devrait pas lasser les joueurs même les moins initiés au monde du jeu **** peut tout de même noter quelques défauts sur le jeu, comme par exemple sa courte durée de vie ou bien sa caméra parfois capricieuse mais tout de même , pour moi Little nightmares est un jeu qui mérite de rester dans l'histoire du jeu vidéo. En tout cas, il restera dans mon cœur de joueur."
BumpkinSTABBY,2025-01-31,90,thats some good cocaine the devs were snorting cause holy damn this game is weird af.
ApenBallen,2025-01-12,90,it was a beautifull game wich managed too give me a few scares so ye thats all i really had
Yabs,2024-10-15,90,"I loved Little Nightmares from beginning to end. What a novel and visually gratifying this puzzle / platformer game is. I appreciate it even more after playing Little Nightmares 2, a solid 10/10. I played this on Xbox and for some reason Metacritic's Xbox user review function doesn't function for sh&*T"
pizzalover2788,2024-10-05,60,"El juego se presta a jugarlo, estéticamente es muy atractivo y la historia me ha gustado."
AIlekai,2024-09-26,90,"One of the best horror platformers I have ever played. This game is almost perfect. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer, but there is DLC to scratch that itch."
LolSmash,2024-09-14,80,"Wow, I liked the creepy atmosphere and the gameplay was good, but you can't understand much of the story with the first part"
lonelydevil90,2024-09-04,70,"Game is nice and innovative, the narrative is very obscure and interesting. What the game lacks is some actual gameplay, resulting sometimes in just a scroller with some platforming here and there and a lot of anxiety. Game is also quite short (around 3h)"
Tchurusbango,2024-08-22,90,"A very unforgettable experience, you start by waking up from a nightmare and that's it, your 3-hour adventure begins in search of surviving this strange place, certainly one of the best memories of my life"
fudenci_gamer,2024-08-21,80,"Amigos JOGASSO DA PORRAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O jogo tem toda essa pegada de um mundo desconhecido, um cenário complexo e incompreensível e isso tudo cria uma atmosfera realmente aterrorizante no jogo. Eu zerei Little Nightmares a pouco mais de 3 meses e ainda me recordo do quão lindo eram os cenários, o plot twist, os inimigos, tudo é muito bem feito e muito bem pensado. A soundtrack desse jogo é outra banger, por sí só ja dar um cagaço em todo mundo, eu achei as músicas muito boas e que combinaram muito com o tema, sendo algo mais estranho, como um ""pequeno pesadelo"" hahahahaaaaaaa.... Os puzzles sao até que bons, eu sou idiota entao demorei algum tempinho pra passar deles, mas são bons de se resolver. Os designs são muito criativos, feitos para parecer ainda mais algo grotesco, algo porco, sujo, tudo nesse jogo se complementa muito bem!!!!!!!!!! AMIGOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, vale para caralhoooo!!!!!!!!!!! Jajá farei da DLC e do segundo jogo!!!!!!!!!! AGUARDEM"
mustafa0708,2024-07-29,40,Küçük bir kızı yönettiğimiz oyun çeşitli bulmacaları buluyoruz gezindiğimiz yerdede birkaç yaratıklar var yürüyoruz kaçıyoruz birşekilde fakat oyun gerçekten biryerden sonra sıkıyor atmosferi bana kalırsa çok baskılı bulanık ve soğutuyor bu yüzden tam bir inceleme yazamam
Lodux,2024-04-06,80,"Graphics 10+; Playability 8; Longevity 7 Beautiful game with wonderful graphics, the game is short, the ending is disappointing"
Zeldren,2024-03-19,80,"Scénario et direction artistique incroyable, un bon jeu d'épouvante un peu plateformer et énigmes. Un peu court cependant et le DLC est assez meh."
Markltv,2024-01-27,90,One of my favourite games ever. Just have a thing for dark atmosphere and creep. The ship mission is top notch
dogukansapmz,2024-01-27,70,Küçük bir çocuk olarak hayata kalıp bilmediğimiz bir gemiden kaçmaya çalıştığımız kaliteli bir yapım. Oyun mükemmel atmosferlere sahip + olarak tag'lerde belirtilmesede alttan alttan mükemmel bir hikayeye sahip. Oynayın.Tamamiyle öneriyorum. 🅖🅤🅜🅤🅢
junglewolf,2023-12-31,90,"For the style of the game, it's almost perfect. Timeless graphics, impeccable ambience, great soundtrack. The only defects I found were the interaction with objects (which sometimes doesn't work as expected) and the input lag. The adventure is short (about 3 or 4 hours), but what matters is the experience it provides. Unique game. It is worth it (The DLCs are good too)"
nullifir,2023-11-24,50,"разрабы не дали понять, кто я. я никто, нигде, сражаюсь против никого, зачем? чтобы сбежать."
Winzidy,2023-09-17,70,good but to expensive
frederik1478,2023-10-17,40,I want to enjoy this game. It is atmospheric. It looks good. It has interesting art design it has all the visual qualities. I enjoy but I just sadly go to sleep while playing it the gameplay is just so simple that I begin to fall asleep. I enjoyed games like limbo and inside but sadly this one just didn't do anything for me so maybe it's just a mething. I didn't find the storytelling so interesting in this one. it's Worth giving a shot to see if you like it but I did not
Animus_V0x,2023-10-16,100,"Beautifully bewitching and frightening. This game made me work up a real sweat, both because some of the levels were really hard (not impossible tho), but also because of the creepy atmosphere and the quite litterally nightmarish characters Six encounters."
XxKrackonxX,2023-10-15,90,"من الالعاب اللي اعتبرها ابتكرت منهجية فنيه جديدة في عالم الالعاب بايصالها الفن الاسود الخالص, تجسيد الاستهلاكية المخيفة و تجيسد كوابيس المختزل في سلوك الوحوش و البيئة المصممة يعطي شعور بالخوف و القشعيرية الرائعة بفضل كل العوامل المحيطة باسلوب اللعب صوتاًَ وصورةً و حتى اسلوب اللعب"
Alarchou,2023-09-12,90,L'ambiance est génial et l'histoire est tellement dérangeante c'est trop bien. 18/20
Richard_dias,2023-08-15,80,"Interesting but overpriced game. I really enjoyed it, and the DLCs are pretty worth it too."
dandalis,2023-08-06,60,"A game clearly taking heavy inspiration from Playdead's Limbo and Inside, and while Little Nightmares manages to add its own flair, it doesnt quite match those games in my opinion. The 2.5D approach here is interesting, but it becomes a nuisance in critical parts of the game where it's challenging to percept depth while you're platforming. The game also tries to emulate Playdead's trial and error gameplay approach by making you die quite often, but here it somehow doesnt feel as fair. The game world is intriguing however, it's filled with dread and atmosphere, and it keeps you thinking about what is going on it. Some later parts of the game are genuinely nail biting. An overall decent game, but doesnt quite grab me as the games it's trying to live up to."
majesty_x,2023-08-03,80,Graphics: 8/10; Storyline: 8/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 9/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 8/10
hortlak,2023-07-18,70,
krashno,2023-07-06,100,"Très bon graphisme bonne ambiance, l'ost et très bonne et le jeu en lui même est très intéressant, mystérieux et angoissant, je vous le conseil!"
Ramin2005,2023-06-08,80,"It's fun game with good puzzles and sometimes scary too but it's too short you can beat it in 2 hours in your first playthrough, If you like horror games it's for you."
tensioly,2023-06-06,80,"Little Nightmares es un juego muy bueno. Un diseño artístico como pocos en la industria y una jugabilidad más que correcta. La historia también resulta muy intrigante e interesante. Tanto el sonido como la música son sobresalientes. Tiene algunos errores de jugabilidad como caerte en algunas zonas donde no deberías caerte o una duración algo escasa. Aun así, totalmente recomendado para quien le guste un terror light. 8,2/10 (08/2020)"
Midyen,2023-06-01,80,"Based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, I will give it a rating of 8."
Lezzly,2023-05-29,80,"Sympatyczna gra, w której mierzymy się z naszymi małymi lękami. Charakterystycznym dla mnie elementem, z którym najbardziej kojarzę tę produkcję jest muzyka. Klimatycznie gra trzyma wysoki poziom co pozwala z łatwością wczuć się w grę. Styl graficzny przyjemny dla oka, a zagadki jakie oferują nam twórcy są interesujące."
zNeverSleep,2023-05-14,70,"I changed my mind about it. Well, let's just say my first playthrough of this game was not good. However, for some reason, I decided to give the second game a chance, and then... yes! I absolutely loved it. Since I was left with that famous taste of ""I want something more,"" I returned to the first one. So, did it get better after all? The story was the easiest one to get involved in because I was really into the plot of the second game. The six's perspective became so interesting after seeing what happened before all of that. The villains were not all memorable - and to be honest, they were kind of dumb since the AI is not that good. Speaking about the gameplay, it is strange. It's not that responsive, and the uneven composition just made everything worse. Yeah, it makes sense cinematically, but it's a pain in the a**. Just like the second game, there's an amazing atmosphere around you. It's not that deep, but it's enough for most people. That game made me value the sequel even more because I could see clearly where they got much better. Anyway, I hope there's a third game."
joaski94,2023-05-02,80,"For fans of horror and atmposheric games, I think this is a must-play. The game's aesthetic is excellent, gameplay is simple but effective and the story is interesting."
Nick7000,2023-03-09,90,"Потрясающий визуал, отличный геймплей, до усрачки великолепный хоррор. Крайне рекомендую!"
WillBuddy,2023-02-20,100,Incredible game and extremely immersive. Great first entry to one of my favorite game series.
arllda,2023-02-04,60,"The story is really interesting, it makes you wonder, but even though it is short, it gets very boring after a while, you always do the same thing, I loved the music of the game and the finale"
Asporkan,2023-01-31,100,"It's a nice game and scary+puzzle excites people and adds great pleasure to the game. If your computer's video card and processor etc. If it's good, I recommend you to play it."
MisaelPro,2023-01-27,80,"El arte y la musica son muy buenas, las mecanicas aunque no son muy dificiles tienen su grado de dificultad, el juego me mantuvo sumergido en el desenado saber que iba a pasar despues de principio a fin,"
DreamAli,2023-01-04,90,The atmosphere is incredible. The game is awesome Highly recommend you play it
Ogurec1996,2023-01-01,100,"I'm excited about this game. I have not seen such elaborate details in any game. I was also delighted with the DLC, the plot of which perfectly complemented the main one"
gratzthejail,2022-12-31,90,"jogo muito gostoso de jogar, atmosfera sinistra direção de arte IMPECAVEL, gostoso de jogar, da um medo forte, divertido na medida certa, puzzles divertidos, historia milaborante que me deixou pensando bem depois de jogar, kncrivel de vdd."
brokencinho,2022-12-21,90,"Increible juego de terror, visualmente es una gran experiencia, la historia te atrapa!"
pawq,2022-12-11,60,"Like many others, I can't help comparing Little Nightmares to INSIDE, but for me that's not necessarily a good thing. Like INSIDE, it's a very pretty, atmospheric 2.5D platformer, where you traverse a mysteriously hostile world as a tiny human. A lot of traps await and a lot of things are out to get you, and you have to sneak past them all on the way to freedom (?). The world design is gloomy yet charming and the music adds to the experience. Like in INSIDE, the journey is at times quite monotonous, with not enough movement mechanics to keep the player engaged physically. Because of the lack of narration and the mysteriousness of everything, it's also difficult to get engaged emotionally, other than ""protect this cute little thing from dem ugly big things"". The puzzles were decent, but most of the time rather trivial, so intellectual engagement also wasn't really a thing. Because of the overall lack of engagement, I simply didn't care about the game most of the way through, which is a shame, because the concept felt like it had more potential! Like INISDE, it's a solid 6."
lessacebola,2022-12-10,90,"Little Nightmares tem uma atmosfera espetacular que é bastante tenebrosa, a história do jogo é bem intrigante e a direção de arte é maravilhosa. O jogo também tem vários puzzles bem interessantes."
Amsheagar,2022-12-01,80,"Little nightmares has amazing atmosphere. Very short but concise game. I finished in 4,5 hours, but it worths the money and time. It is horror, platformer game. I have issues with the control and the camera sometimes, but it isnt that bad. The sounds and music are amazing. There is no directly storytelling, but there is in the graphics, enviroment and act. I recommend for who likes a little shudder and atmosphere."
Soullex,2022-11-30,70,Bazı yerlerde bilmiyorsaniz kesinlikle bir kez ölüyorsunuz. Bu biraz can sıkıyor.
Jollyolfun,2022-11-18,80,i love this game's atmosphere and gameplay. the bosses arent scary but really creepy
jirny,2022-11-06,90,"по-настоящему криповая игра. сколько выкурили гейм-дизы, чтобы нарисовать таких противников?)"
mustado,2022-10-22,70,"esse jogotraz a opressão, a fome, a miseéria e a vingança de um jeito cabuloso. è um jogo bem rápido (2-3 horas) que te faz pensar. Pena que os bugs na hitbox atrapalham bastante a experiência"
basic123,2022-10-18,90,"Good game which hold its promises. The story, graphics and gameplay are very polished and it was a pleasure to finish the game."
