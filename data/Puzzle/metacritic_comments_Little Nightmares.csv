Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-31,thats some good cocaine the devs were snorting cause holy damn this game is weird af.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-01-12,it was a beautifull game wich managed too give me a few scares so ye thats all i really had
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-15,"i loved little nightmares from beginning to end. what a novel and visually gratifying this puzzle  platformer game is. i appreciate it even more after playing little nightmares 2, a solid 1010. i played this on xbox and for some reason metacritic's xbox user review function doesn't function for sht"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-26,"one of the best horror platformers i have ever played. this game is almost perfect. my only complaint is that it wasn't longer, but there is dlc to scratch that itch."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"wow, i liked the creepy atmosphere and the gameplay was good, but you can't understand much of the story with the first part"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-04,"game is nice and innovative, the narrative is very obscure and interesting. what the game lacks is some actual gameplay, resulting sometimes in just a scroller with some platforming here and there and a lot of anxiety. game is also quite short around 3h"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-22,"a very unforgettable experience, you start by waking up from a nightmare and that's it, your 3hour adventure begins in search of surviving this strange place, certainly one of the best memories of my life"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-06,"graphics 10 playability 8 longevity 7 beautiful game with wonderful graphics, the game is short, the ending is disappointing"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-27,one of my favourite games ever. just have a thing for dark atmosphere and creep. the ship mission is top notch
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-12-31,"for the style of the game, it's almost perfect. timeless graphics, impeccable ambience, great soundtrack. the only defects i found were the interaction with objects which sometimes doesn't work as expected and the input lag. the adventure is short about 3 or 4 hours, but what matters is the experience it provides. unique game. it is worth it the dlcs are good too"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-17,good but to expensive
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-17,i want to enjoy this game. it is atmospheric. it looks good. it has interesting art design it has all the visual qualities. i enjoy but i just sadly go to sleep while playing it the gameplay is just so simple that i begin to fall asleep. i enjoyed games like limbo and inside but sadly this one just didn't do anything for me so maybe it's just a mething. i didn't find the storytelling so interesting in this one. it's worth giving a shot to see if you like it but i did not
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-16,"beautifully bewitching and frightening. this game made me work up a real sweat, both because some of the levels were really hard not impossible tho, but also because of the creepy atmosphere and the quite litterally nightmarish characters six encounters."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-15,"interesting but overpriced game. i really enjoyed it, and the dlcs are pretty worth it too."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-06,"a game clearly taking heavy inspiration from playdead's limbo and inside, and while little nightmares manages to add its own flair, it doesnt quite match those games in my opinion. the 2.5d approach here is interesting, but it becomes a nuisance in critical parts of the game where it's challenging to percept depth while you're platforming. the game also tries to emulate playdead's trial and error gameplay approach by making you die quite often, but here it somehow doesnt feel as fair. the game world is intriguing however, it's filled with dread and atmosphere, and it keeps you thinking about what is going on it. some later parts of the game are genuinely nail biting. an overall decent game, but doesnt quite grab me as the games it's trying to live up to."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-03,graphics 810 storyline 810 gameplay 810 atmosphere 910 music 810 summary rating 810
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-08,"it's fun game with good puzzles and sometimes scary too but it's too short you can beat it in 2 hours in your first playthrough, if you like horror games it's for you."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-06-01,"based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, i will give it a rating of 8."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-05-14,"i changed my mind about it. well, let's just say my first playthrough of this game was not good. however, for some reason, i decided to give the second game a chance, and then... yes! i absolutely loved it. since i was left with that famous taste of i want something more, i returned to the first one. so, did it get better after all? the story was the easiest one to get involved in because i was really into the plot of the second game. the six's perspective became so interesting after seeing what happened before all of that. the villains were not all memorable  and to be honest, they were kind of dumb since the ai is not that good. speaking about the gameplay, it is strange. it's not that responsive, and the uneven composition just made everything worse. yeah, it makes sense cinematically, but it's a pain in the a. just like the second game, there's an amazing atmosphere around you. it's not that deep, but it's enough for most people. that game made me value the sequel even more because i could see clearly where they got much better. anyway, i hope there's a third game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-05-02,"for fans of horror and atmposheric games, i think this is a mustplay. the game's aesthetic is excellent, gameplay is simple but effective and the story is interesting."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-20,incredible game and extremely immersive. great first entry to one of my favorite game series.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-04,"the story is really interesting, it makes you wonder, but even though it is short, it gets very boring after a while, you always do the same thing, i loved the music of the game and the finale"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-31,"it's a nice game and scarypuzzle excites people and adds great pleasure to the game. if your computer's video card and processor etc. if it's good, i recommend you to play it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-04,the atmosphere is incredible. the game is awesome highly recommend you play it
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-01,"i'm excited about this game. i have not seen such elaborate details in any game. i was also delighted with the dlc, the plot of which perfectly complemented the main one"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-12-11,"like many others, i can't help comparing little nightmares to inside, but for me that's not necessarily a good thing. like inside, it's a very pretty, atmospheric 2.5d platformer, where you traverse a mysteriously hostile world as a tiny human. a lot of traps await and a lot of things are out to get you, and you have to sneak past them all on the way to freedom ?. the world design is gloomy yet charming and the music adds to the experience. like in inside, the journey is at times quite monotonous, with not enough movement mechanics to keep the player engaged physically. because of the lack of narration and the mysteriousness of everything, it's also difficult to get engaged emotionally, other than protect this cute little thing from dem ugly big things. the puzzles were decent, but most of the time rather trivial, so intellectual engagement also wasn't really a thing. because of the overall lack of engagement, i simply didn't care about the game most of the way through, which is a shame, because the concept felt like it had more potential! like inisde, it's a solid 6."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-12-01,"little nightmares has amazing atmosphere. very short but concise game. i finished in 4,5 hours, but it worths the money and time. it is horror, platformer game. i have issues with the control and the camera sometimes, but it isnt that bad. the sounds and music are amazing. there is no directly storytelling, but there is in the graphics, enviroment and act. i recommend for who likes a little shudder and atmosphere."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-11-18,i love this game's atmosphere and gameplay. the bosses arent scary but really creepy
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-18,"good game which hold its promises. the story, graphics and gameplay are very polished and it was a pleasure to finish the game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-16,my score  7
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-16,"fantastic experience, mood, graphcis, etc, this game's only problem is that the sequel prequel? is just better in every way"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-09-10,"little nightmares is one of my favorite games. it reminds me of limbo but ln have more thrilling events, where you have to run for your life and try not to end in bubbling pot. limbo is more puzzleish game. here are also puzzles especially in dlc but less. furthermore it has great, creepy and unforgettable soundtrack, cool graphics and overall perfect atmosphere."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-08-01,"this is a great game with a good atmosphere, i won't say anything more! play better by yourself. meow"

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-28,"great art, great ambiance, great soundtrack and some good tension moments. but puzzles are so simple that it feels more like a walking simulator than puzzleplatformer. if it had better puzzles, i would put it in the same category where i would put inside and limbo."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-14,this game is scarier than you might think. with its 2.5 d environments it takes you on a very nice short trip through a cold and unforgiving world. the clay style art is also really unique and adds to the whole feel of the game. it gives off some tim burton vibes. the twist at the end is really well done. looking forward to playing the sequel
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-02,"this game is more of a puzzle  platformer game with elements of horror. most of the game involves finding a lever to pull, or finding a key and putting it in a lock, or sneaking around a giant monster behind their backs as they turn around. sometimes you have to figure out interesting ways to climb to the top of the ceiling by trial and error. gameplay wise, its really fun and its a little scary. for example, i was sweating bullets as i snuck around a giant scary looking chef chopping meat up. i didnt know what to do in the level so i panicked and tried everything to figure out how to get out of the room. i was super relieved to figure out the solution on my own after dying a couple times from the ugly chef. hint sometimes i overthink it so the solution is usually the easiest one! in the beginning of the game, there are no tutorials. only if you get stuck for a while, the game hint pop up reminds you of a button you should press youll need to get around the level. i used an xbox one controller and it worked great. i highly recommend using an xbox controller for this game. there were no bugs i came across and it was smooth throughout. being on ultra settings on my pc, graphics were super detailed and gave a perfectly spooky vibe throughout. very dark rooms and disgusting looking textures everywhere. it is a really, really short game but a good one as it can easily be beaten in around 34 hours. i wish it was longer! storywise, i dont fully understand it but it gets dark very, very quickly. avoiding spoilers, i was shocked at some of the things the main character did. i was shocked at some of the disgusting things that happened in this game. it is mildly depressing and it truly is a scary nightmare. but in the perspective of your main character, a young female child. the game does not have a narrator or text to tell the player what is going on in the story. it is all done through the gameplay and silent cutscenes. in fact, not a single word is spoken in this game. youd have to come up with your own interpretation or look up online to find out what the story is about. there is some replicability in the game, theres unlockables and lots of hidden items that will unlock concept art in the main menu. if you go out of the way, you might spot details you didnt see before and find new areas with a hidden item. overall, this game is totally worth playing. a shorty but a goody as it can easily be beaten in one day. i just wish it was a little longer! the developers also made a bunch of dlc, a mobile game, and another game called little nightmares 2. i look forward to playing them soomeday to find out more about this very interestingly dark story. an easy 910."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-02,"i'm really keen on this game atmosphere is brilliant sometimes you feel a horror, sometimes you you get a little peaceful moments, but you always in interest about future events"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-03-22,"little nightmares is a puzzleplatform horror adventure game developed by tarsier studios and published by bandai namco entertainment. set in a mysterious world, little nightmares follows the journey of six, a hungry little girl who must escape the maw, an iron vessel inhabited by monstrous, twisted beings. the game received positive reviews upon release with critics praising its atmosphere, graphics, and sound while criticizing its checkpoint system and a short length."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-03-16,one of the best game i've ever played. a unique atmosphere and an incredible ost. a masterpiece
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-02-08,"fun little game, i liked the vibe and the setting, and the monster designs are great"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-02-05,one of the best games i've ever played! it is a masterpiece! especially on pc in 4k it really shines! and it has an absolute superb dlc called secrets of the maw! a must have for every videogame lover!
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-01-29,this game is as beautiful but short.. i beat it in 2 hours i hate our character...
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-01-22,this is one of the best games i've ever played! the atmosphere is one of a kind. no typical jumpscares. there are some calm moments when you're just walking quietly and admiring the environment and there are some tense moments when you're running from the disgusting creatures of that world. it's really one of the most atmospheric games in the world. it's short though.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-12-27,little nightmares has great atmosphere. it's an excellent puzzleplatformadventure game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-12-04,very well made game i played it the second time with my cousin and had a great time.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-23,this game is very good. the style and the vissuals are just soo good. and the type of the horror in this game too are very cool. not to scary but not to boring horror eather. but the thing that can be bad sometimes is the camera winkle are kinda wierd. so 910
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-10-20,this game takes limbo and inside to the next level... let me rephrase this because of the comment...little nightmares does not look like limbo. limbo looks like little nightmares
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-10-16,"i loved this game, probably one of the best horror experiences i've ever had."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-09-25,"a horror platformer that provides multiple locations to explore and a variety of monsters that you have to run and hide from. however it is very short, so be certain you want this game before buying."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-08-27,"a bit weaker than the first part, fewer monsters, more understatements, but overall quite good"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-08-26,"filled with excellent visual and sound designs, little nightmares is an atmospheric adventure that will intrigues you even after completion."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-27,"little nightmares is a little artistic horror video game that will surprise you. it's pacing and balancing are great, it's not as memorable as inside or as as good either. but little nightmares is a very fun little experience."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-27,"little nightmares is a atmospheric puzzle platformer. the graphics, music and tone on offer is amazing and can see the cult following on this game. i like the ability to traverse and use your environment with the ever looming fear it offers. the variety of gameplay is also interesting as it delivers puzzle solving, stealth and escapes from danger. surprisingly there are also boss battle moments also. the game works in what it has to achieve and displays your character evolving over time with no spoken words. a downfall for me at least is a lack of plot. you are just dumped into this zone and you leave. unsure the underlying purpose of the truly artful game. yes i got this game for free on steam, but to pay full retail i would wonder if i got my money's worth with just 4 hours of gameplay. i definitely recommend when a sale appears to try this thriller."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-18,nearly died playing it .
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-14,"really nice graphics and style with also a good and inmersive soundtrack. a bit short maybe, just 23 hours. worst thing is about its controls and camera. the fixed 3rd person camera  the clunky controls make almost imposible to target anything in the game. specially affecting jumps and persecutions. that makes all the game difficulty relays on its poor controls and camera."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-10,"little nightmares is a super bad version of limbo. the gameplay mechanics are just so poorly designed. this is a guessandcheck puzzle game. you keep repeating each section over and over again until you get it right. there's so much unforgiving guesswork involved. and the backtracking whenever you fail is really painful. there's too much downtime repeating sections, and it's not fun. the contextual clues are badly designed. for example, some enemies sniff around even though they can't smell you. however, they have perfect sight. the camera angles and controls also really, really  in a lot of sections, leading to unnecessary deaths. sometimes you push doors open by walking into them while running doesn't work. sometimes you can push open doors by running into them. and sometimes you can push them open by holding the action button. it's never consistent, which makes escape sequences entirely tedious guessandcheck routines. the jump  action combination is the worst of all. there's a 5050 chance whether or not an object is climbable while holding the action button. try doing that over and over again during an escape sequence."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-07,"a really good game with exceptional level design, great sound effects and some excellent high speed chase sequences which you will have to be on your toes for. the only things that let the game down are it's very short duration 24 hours max, puzzles that are a bit simple and slightly clunky controls."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-03,"really cool game, the monster and level designs are really good. i dislike that there really isn't a story and nothing about the world is explained. the gameplay is clunky at parts but it didn't bother me much."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-03,"a mesmerizing experience. both creepy and cute, very atmospheric. the only disadvantage is its poorly made savingloading points. a unique game recommended to anyone."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-30,"attention this is just my opinion! little nightmare i  '' strange horror puzzle game? '' my first impression of the game is really awesome and adventurous. not much to talk about in this game is a really detailed and great puzzle game. i really liked the whole atmosphere just so everything looks so great and interesting purely the theme of that game. the theme of the game is really great as if it all started from start to finish as you seem to have walked straight and no loading screen. the story itself is not so very understandable no one explains to you here you have to shake your head and ponder for yourself what the whole story of what is going on here is about here. the puzzles themselves are not difficult they are quite easy and complex so 5050. you just need to think more, because you can get stuck in some places as well. now speaking of the horror itself i dont know much i would say it was scary and a big horror here. so to me, thats a minus. well, the atmosphere and details are really scary. but the bottom line is that most places could have been more dark and more jumpscare. which will scare you more because the character had one of the lighters which is used very little only in certain places where necessary. the game itself is definitely worth a look because the game itself goes so smoothly and in detail. so in my opinion, i really enjoyed the game and deserved a lot of attention and fame. it was fun to play and find out what was lurking here, but the bottom line was that the game as horror really wasnt that much to make me very horrified. i would dedicate myself to this game 810."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-29,when i thought inside is the best adventurepuzzle game with dark atmosphere game little nightmares come out and has entered a whole new level. its great game with fantastic atmosphere. i will definitely buy a sequel.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-05,"little nightmares is a horroradventure platformer made by tarsier studios and published by bandai namco. right in the beginning of the game you don't now who and where you are. as the plot progresses, the story becomes more and more recognizable. the puzzle elements are well made and it is very fun to climb on books or cabinet doors as a little human being in a horrific world full with monstrous creatures. the game doesn't include any jump scares and focuses more at the atmosphere than the horror elements. everything fits perfect, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the graphics, the performance runs on my gtx 760 with ultra settings 60fps and the story telling. sadly , the game receives to little recognition."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-10,"great game. i finished it in less than 6 hours, and im a slow player. really get you in the mode with the cinematic vision and soundtrack. totally recommended"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-06,"i think little nightmares is a good horror platformer. unfortunately, i have to say that i don't like the game very much. first of all, i hate having to watch children being tortured, and secondly, i hate that dark, drippy atmosphere where the owner of a nice living room can't be none other than a maneater."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,really good. i don't like horror games but it was short enough to keep me playing. it is darker than trailers and promo illustrations
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-28,this game is bad. .
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-22,"good plot, nice animations and graphics in general. the second part of the game as a whole was even more pleasant, but without the first it would be difficult to see the big picture."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-21,pro charming atmosphere technical realization of the highest level stellar audio design versus short term playability without jolts
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-15,"finished the game in around four hours. while the visual style was good especially the enemy characters, the game was very easy and way too short. i also did not find it scary enough to tag it as horror. only buy at a steep discount."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-02-14,"great game that combines platforming with stealht and puzzle solving. it slowly creates a horrific world, and it becomes a psycological experience to the likes of limbo or inside. the only con is that it is too short 34h aprox.."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-11-05,"little nightmare is a cool puzzle platformer game with great graphics and visuals, but personally i prefer inside and limbo...because their story is darker and more complicated than little nightmares'. game itself was exciting and cool but dlcs were boring. also there weren't really hard puzzles and beating game was easy. generally it's a good puzzle platformer and worth playing and also it shouldn't be classified as a horror game because it wasn't scary at all!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-10-03,"not so much frightening as fascinating. unique and charming atmosphere, interesting level and character design, nontrivial quests particularly in dlc and riddles. it was a short, but captivating, sweet and exciting journey with perfectly sustained suspense and immersion effect. would also like to mention especially outstanding music, sound design and smart and cinematic camera movement which makes it very satisfying to play."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-09-01,"this is odd because the game is rather linear but i beat it like 4 times. its that good. when playing you feel like you are taken to another dimension. audio, graphics, design  jesus, everythings top quality. i can't wait to play the sequel."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-07-07,"the perfect game, super cool visual effects, rich environnement, i consider this game as a must play"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-06-29,"another game on a shelf of minimalistic and atmospheric horrorplatformers to inside and limbo which i played. the plot is also not obvious, everything is told without words and through the details of both the environment and official art for the game. the work with the sound is great  a bit monotonous and tricky, it's creepy and uncomfortable enough. but a separate respection for the overall design of the environment, the inhabitants of crew the longarmed keeper scared me most of all and a new world that blends harmoniously into the universe of inside's game"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-06-06,"not as good as inside, still pretty good ."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-05-12,"nice game in essence, but a little bit too short. good level design and visuals."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-03-14,the art of that game is so nice. puzzles are sometimes annoying but especially the controls sometimes become so frustrating. i also played all the dlcs. i can say the dlcs are okay. 11hrs on record.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-02-20,"little nightmares is yet again a return to the dark atmospheric adventure genre popularized by inside and its predecessor, limbo. again, the environment and atmosphere tells the story. however, unlike inside, this game executes the setting much better, with an escape theme that's much less bizarre and psychotic. similar to inside, you're thrown right into the game without any indication as to what to do. there are lot of controls in this game, but a few minutes of fiddling around or checking the control settings will set you on the right track. despite having too many controls, it was actually better for the game instead, as it added realistic physics to the game and made it feel much less onedimensional. in a nutshell, everything more or less feels like an alternate version of inside, except done better and with a different story. it's not super scary, but it does get tense from time to time. the levels that involve actual people can be quite challenging as you have to actually use your head a bit. i personally didn't find the game as short as others claimed it to be it can easily last six hours or more, which is a decent length for an indie game. secrets of the maw dlc  810 the dlc is a mustplay since it is canon and ties onto the main story. it is surprisingly lengthy and all three parts were designed incredibly well. they were reasonably more difficult than the main game. to access the dlc, you have to go to chapter select and enter the far left room on the bottom row. the devs simply dumped all three parts of the dlc there, which is confusing and can easily be missed. the third part in particular had puzzles that weren't straightforward and needed you to think outside of the box. it felt more like an advancedlevel escape the room with multiple elements and no indication at all as to what you should do. i used a guide since i knew it would've kept me lost for hours, and i wasn't wrong about that. there were things in the puzzles i would have never noticed without using the guide. is the third part good then? that depends on whether or not you're a pro at escape the room games. i honestly think the difficulty could've been toned down a bit, considering the overall gameplay up until now. some clues to lead you along the right track would've improved it a lot."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2020-01-12,this game is looking good but the configuration is very bad. you will angry about the controller.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2019-11-07,"a wonderful game. throughout the game, uncertainty, danger and hostility remain. there is no fear, there are terrible moments and disgusting. this emphasizes the personality of the game. there are no screamers, this is great. the game is logical, the world of utopia. the ending is wonderful"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-11-19,"it were good 25 hours. the perfect small and atmospheric adventure. dlcs add more 1,52 hours of a hours."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-10-16,"it's creepy and it's kooky, mysterious and spooky it's altogether ooky .... it's little nightmares! as stated by others, if you love limbo and inside then you'll like this game a lot! again, as others have said, this game has a tim burton meets evilstudioghibli aesthetic. it's soundtrack is creepy and works well to raise the tension as you tip toe and hide through the various rooms and past grotesque enemies. a few people complaining at the lack of story compared to the likes of inside and limbo. whilst the story is certainly ambiguous, i felt it was less so than the aforementioned titles. the story was certainly good enough to make me audibly gasp in shock at certain points. it is quite a short game, but the dlc pads it out nicely and ups the stakes in terms of scaring the living bejeezus out of me. summary two thumbs. highly recommended  an absolute musthave if if you like inside and limbo and don't mind ambiguity in your storytelling."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-10-10,"this is a great game, really one of a kind. it's both an artistic and technical masterpiece. i think there is much more jewel to discover in it, so it definitely needs a sequel or more. this game is about childhood fears and sadness, it's as depressing as scary. it will also give you moral dilemmas and disturb your conscience. i gave 9 out of 10 because, it doesn't allow you to skip the long credits part at the end of the game, which was frustrating. also the game is quite short."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-29,"a horror platformer that provides multiple locations to explore and a variety of monsters that you have to run and hide from. however it is very short, so be certain you want this game before buying."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-12,"this game is very different from any other game i've played. the atmosphere is incredibly creepy, the monsters are made very well and it makes you keep wondering what their backstory might be. the game graphics and art design are made so well that it feels like an animated movie rather than a game, for how smooth the movement and actions are, and your interaction with the environment. even with no dialogue, you can easily start imagining what the story might be about, and the amazing thing is anyone can come up with their own version of the backstory. i absolutely recommend this game as a must!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-02-17,"ill be honest i didnt exactly know what to expect when jumping into this game. from the trailers i assumed it would be like a dark tim burton film with an engaging story plot and a dark and lurking atmosphere. well i was at least half right there. little nightmares is one of those indie games that shouldnt be twenty dollars for the experience alone, because that experience is like a short roller coaster ride that ended abruptly and without any true understanding as to why. i havent read any of the comics or background information about this game, i am giving you a review from my experience jumping in. so of course there is going to be a lot of information that is lost in translation, i wont need you to tell me where i am right and wrong. but i am sure you will do so anyway. anyway back on point. you play as a nameless character unless you read the comics or whatever then you find out the characters name is six, but as i mentioned above who is of ambiguous gender and wears a bright yellow raincoat. you wake up having a fever dream of an asian lady looking at you. i dont blame the thing, id wake up from a dream that was getting a little too heavy for me to handle as well. once you come to your senses you seem to be in a prisonship where everything is dark and murky. this is where i will stop, because this game is an experience worth having. the game controls like limbo, and lets be honest it might as well be limbo. just with a brighter color tone. you can walk, run, jump, grab things and manipulate the camera. the challenges arent too terrible. i instinctively knew what i was doing, so i never really got stuck. the obstacles youll face are these grotesque creatures that resembles a tim burton nightmare. however considering that this indie game was published by bandai games i wouldnt be surprised if it was an exaggerated representation of the american culture. but i doubt it, i just thought that would be a funny connection. youll spend most of your time running away and hiding because you are a tiny being in this world. youll find nomes that will run from you. once you find them you can give them hugs, but ill be honest. considering you perform one of the best dr hannibal lecture inspirations on one of them over a thick sausage, i wouldnt become too attached. the overall plot is told through visual metaphors, and this game does perform that extremely well. its is a beautiful game in the most dark way possible. all of this is accompanied by beautiful sound design that does set the tone of the game. however the game isnt worth 20. considering you can beat the game in two hours and have to spend extra money to get extended gameplay with dlc, you can see where i became disappointed. but at least i was able to get it out of the way on one of my off days. so thats a plus. overall, if youre looking for a game that is dark and doesnt overuse blood and gore. accompanied by amazing visuals and sound design and have some money to spend. this game is worth the play through. i do wish it was a longer experience. the ending was strange to say the least. but it was still a good game. hope this swayed your opinion."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-02-09,"a beautiful, dark game. the game is halfway between a walking simulator, a puzzle game and a platformer. the controls are awful awful awful, fortunately, the game is not hard, so the narrative and the atmosphere give a very immersive feeling. this game has a somewhat open interpretation, however, less cryptic than inside."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-11-17,on the first look you might think that little nightmares is one of the playdead studio games. little nightmares is absolutely great game with amazing visual and audio design. it seems to me that this game was inspired by inside and limbo games and its great because little nightmares takes the best things from playdead's creations and add them into the perfect and dark setting.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-11-04,"little nightmares has great atmosphere, environment is truely dreamlike with crazy ladders and botomless pits. it is not trying to startle you with jumpscares, but provides a lot of creeps. game is short and it's length is just right."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-10-16,"the biggest thing about this game is the story... darkest  the most strange story in games  almost perfect gameplay with great lighting  not that much cringy puzzles  challenges  and at the end, one of the best games ive ever played with amazing  dark experience that got me into it for hours to research what was the secret behind the story and what happens next after the ending..."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-09-26,"if you're a fan of creepy stopmotion animation, andor the kind of scary books nobody dares publish for children anymore, this game is a dream come true. an entire grim society is fully fleshed out without a word being spoken, and there's an ending to the story which is both horrifying and satisfyingly amusing."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-09-17,"little nightmares was a proper game. short but proper. but damn, the credits lasted for 30 minutes, they even listed the janitor. it's an excellent puzzleplatformadventure game, that doesn't stop being interesting, while it keeps difficulty very balanced."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-09-08,"five word review 2.5d sidescroller with great visuals. favorite thing loved the visuals, especially the guest area. that area was just amazing. least favorite thing would have liked more story to know what was going on. i enjoyed what i saw but i have no idea why any of it is that way. and why am i and everyone else so hungry? date completed 20170908 playtime  3h enjoyment 910 recommendation if you enjoyed inside or limbo you'll like what you see here."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-06-20,"this the most fun i have had with a video game in a long time, great game play cannot wait for the dlc coming. very immersive game play . very detailed and interesting character design ."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-06-16,"an experiencetype puzzle game, pretty close to inside. it offers a great, fun and aesthetically pleasing experience, though not a long one, and with rather simple puzzles. the good  astonishing graphics, with great style. it's a gem of art, real masterpiece! inside was also supergreat artistically, but little nightmares is probably even better, with 3d models, play of light, excellent textures and enormous attention to detail. you will do yourself a favor if you don't rush thru the game and instead explore every corner of every room, noticing all the minor detals  nice social commentary if i understood it correctly the gluttony of the western society, all those people eating meat and literally shoveling huge chunks of beef with bare hands into their disgusting mouths. when these ugly enemies start chasing your character they are slow and crush furniture in they way  that's hilariious. one of them even shovels your character right into his mouth  gross! in a good way. the kitchen levels are the real high point of this game. maybe the designers should have moved them closer to the beginning of the game. and, interstingly enough, there are a lot of toilets in this game. the hint is transparent.  excellent music score, sets the tone and actively participates in everything. it's really one of those games where music feels like a narrator and not just as background the soso  most puzzles are very simple and the solutions are usually obvious right after you walk into the room. this is probably good for casual gamers, but if you are a hardcore gamer like myself, you should just lower your expectations and accept that this is more an experiencetype application rather than a game. in the second half of it the puzzles do get harder, but mostly because of heavily scripted sequences which you can only solve after you've learned the patterns of enemy behaviors, and for that you will have to die several times.  some chases feel too scripted and cinematic. they do have an emotional effect but overall make it feel even less a game  overall, the game is completely linear. thus no replay value. it's also pretty short. i completed it in 3 sessions, 23 hours each. i guess one cannot expect longer gameplay from a game which doesn't reuse its graphics too much  only 3 types of enemies. they are very memorable though the bad  the ending was confusing. the character suddenly turns evil  why? what for? what is achieved by that? i think they just wanted a twist in the end, or a last shocker in the end to justify its horrow theme.  there is no story, and whatever one could make of it feels pretty shallow. for comparison, inside had tons of story elements, with many possible interpretations. here it's just a more or less random walk, a nightmare without any logic or meaning. well, you can say it's just a nightmare game, as the title puts it, but still, it doesn't feel right. e.g. one could ask why doesn't it have twice more, or twice less levels? it seems that the nighmare ends simply when the required gameplay duration is reached or the allotted development budget is spent.  the controls are optimized for console controllers and aren't very comfortable on pc, even if you remap keys. also, camera sometimes rotates while you move, and the directions of character movement doesn't visually correspond with your key presses  this gets confusing and makes chases harder and more annoying than they should be. overall, it's a great game which almost everyone will like. it's somewhat short and it's a oneoff experience, but for a modest price it's certainly worth a look. it's also a great artistic achievement."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-06-04,"its incredible to me that a game with such maudlin themes and tense, haunting atmosphere could come from a team like tarsier studios, whose previous titles, little big planet 3 and tearaway, were so full of light and cartoonish whimsy. theyve complete flipped the script on their previous oeuvre, crafting a work that left an indelible mark on me as a gamer and as a human being."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-31,"finished in one playthrough, the game is definitely playable and quite visually pleasant even astounding at times, but nothing else. all the environments are repetitive, and so are the perils encountered. the plot is inconsequential. it takes far more to scare an adult than this game manages to do, so i can only confine it to the realm of walking simulators. recommended for children, but don't expect it to entertain them for more than an afternoon it's that short."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-22,what a game it gave me goosebumps and kept my heart pumping sometimes. it reminds me a lot of inside and even though they took lots of ideas from inside they still executed it right. its a bit short that't about it and to be honest i prefer quality over quantity. they can still have a sequel though and i hope they do a sequel because this was very well done.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-21,"little nightmares is fantastic great game. the plot is incomprehensible, but very cool gameplay and amazing atmosphere. looking forward to the sequel."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-13,"the cutest horror game i've ever played. there's a lot to cherish about this game. when i finished it, i wanted it to keep going. i wasn't ready to leave this grotesque nightmare. that might not be the best description of something that is supposed to make you want to wake up. but nonetheless, this game has so much charm, and so much character, that you just want to hug it and keep it close forever. i have my theory on the story. and as it was with inside, it is open for interpretation. so i highly suggest you go buy it, play it, and put together your own. it makes you think."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-11,"this is so like children's tv shows from 1970's sweden, so just like washington post says ... something one might create if they wanted to petrify children instead of amuse them. surely, shows like vilse i pannkakan and trtan must be some of the inspiration. the same feeling of dread may be a bit too much for my taste just because i'm old enough to have been tortured by those nightmare inducing tv shows. i honestly don't think i can continue playing as it really brings back too many bad memories, but you other guys should give it a try ... maybe you had cartoons too watch as a kid and are less traumatized ... i'm giving it a score of 8 for your sake, whereas it could be a personal 1 for me."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-09,very good game. if you liked inside you cant go wrong with this one. limbo was more challenging which i prefer. little nightmares is a little too easy and short as well. but nonetheless a good game which looks very good.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-05,"pros great atmosphere, superb visuals and sound design. cons can be frustrating, mostly because of rare checkpoints sometimes you have to repeat quite long, difficult sequences, it also has a weird control scheme that is not always responsive. you can also find a lot of haha gotcha kinds of traps, where you are sure, that the action sequence is almost over, but there is something else that you suddenly bump into and get caught. most of the times you cannot expect such thing will happen and you cannot prepare for this. it almost looks like a trick to make the game a bit longer, by making sure you will fail some challenges. overall if you are a fan of indie games  i recommend this one, as i had a really good time with it despite occasional frustration."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-04,"i want more and i want it soon. absolutely fantastic game, crude and fresh. it makes you feel each situation in a way that not many games can provide. it's new, it's good and it has no competitor to overshadow it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-03,"this game is as beautiful as is it short.. i beat it in 4 hours.. if you buy and play it,in the end i guarantee you'll be disappointed.. you could maybe buy it on discount because otherwise it's not worth it but that's my opinion of course"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-03,"great game, quite similar to limbo and inside so if you liked them you'll love this one. no objetives, just going ahead and solving puzzles pros superb visuals  atmosphere  cool and varied puzzles cons easy puzzles  no story  it's short but it's worth"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-02,"creepy, dark and very fascinating at the same time. i played this with my gf and we had a few tense moments but it was all good fun. short enough to keep your partner engaged. i definitely recommend it."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-05-01,"little nightmares is short, but it's just bright enough, just safe enough to make me let my bad taste with outlast 2. the game isnt always successful at balancing some game design fundamentals. but when the lights went out, it left me remembering that, really, i'm just a small thing in a dangerous world myself...also, that monsters with big long grabby arms are really, really creepy. turn the volume up, turn the lights off, and let little nightmares keep you awake. what a gem  this is!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-29,this game just reminds me of  a good way...unreal engine 4 really helped to build the tension in this  the theme and atmosphere is just  in my opinion the music is quite good from twinklingcute to creepy soundtrack that is being played in the  i must say the art style is so good..just like i said it reminds me of inside's art  only the bummer that i didn't gave it a 10 score because of how short the game is and a demanding price point of 20..took me about 4hrs. to beat  still...everything about in this game is perfection.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-29,"wonderful art style, graphics, and sound. it is creepy but not in an uncomfortable way. plays like reading a kids story book. this platformer's game play is innovative and interesting with mostly escape type puzzles. it reminds me somewhat of the game inside which was also an awesome game. i took one point off because it has some camera bugs and also because i think they didn't test the pc controls that well. there are areas where the controls just get really frustrating, had to redo several sections an absurd amount of times just because there was one spot where the controls would not respond properly. with a good patch this could be a 10."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-29,"i really wanted to like little nightmares, i really did, but it's just so frustrating to play that it doesn't let me say that i had an enjoyable time playing it, i mean, i like the feeling of being pursued that it gives you, the tension you get... is fun, and it has a good ambient around. that being said, mechanically, this game doesn't work at all, key commands are not responsive enough, which makes this hide and seek mechanic almost unbearable to the point you end up getting frustrated quite often. i got bugged like twice during my playtrough, the ai gets all messed up when you try to make a sound decoy throwing an object, and there is an absurd amount of clipping with some enemies and their interactions. i won't say i had a bad time playing this game, but i feel if they would have taken care of those things i would be praising this game without a doubt."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-29,"little nightmares is a small masterpiece. i have not been this excited about the game! i'm not really waiting for the game, but the trail behind it  it i from the first trailer seemed interesting. it can be compared to inside  this is a logical comparison. but little nightmares is much better! it fascinated. although the same as the inside tells the story only visually. the game looks very nice! gameplay we have a 2d platformer with puzzles. these puzzles are very good, and sometimes intuitive. where a girl called the maw. this is a very atmospheric place, otvratitelnoe sometimes, you really want to run away. we have no dialogue, plot, but visually, the game tells store, story that you feel you see it, and this story ugasaet. little nightmares went out with outlast 2,but little nightmares much crasnei and atmospheric! you do need to hide from enemies, but it's much harder and intense. locations themselves also to keep the tension, you're even scared of light surface roughn. but the cons of the game too. camera is inconvenient. i sometimes do not understand jump or not, since it is not clear you are in the same plane as the ledge or not. also, when you introduce a new gameplay feature e.g. throwing things at once on the screen don't write, you feel stupid. the game has surpassed my expectations. this is the best 2d platformer with puzzles. visualization really tells the story, the game keeps in suspense, the enemies look scary, the music in the game is excellent! buy this game and enjoy! even if not now, then at a discount just buy. the game is worth the money!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-29,"amazing game, great atmosphere and such a nice graphics style, love all the characters and the weird world and story in this game. all the enemies are creepy and weird but cool. gameplay is interesting and puzzles are smart and interesting. what a gem  this is!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-28,"this game has a lot of potential given the atmosphere and game play, sadly it was all overshadowed by the constant bugs. i found myself more often than not clipping through walls, floors, and objects getting stuck. forcing me to manually restart more than play the game. i've encountered a bug twice now that mid way through the level the guest area the character will lose the ability to crouchslide entirely. while this does not make the game impossible to beat it is much harder. i may try this game again at a later date, though the initial release has left me disappointed."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-28,"little nightmares one of the best 2d horror games of all time little nightmares is a puzzle platforming horror game where you play as a girl trying to escape the maw and apparently youre delicious because everyone here is trying to eat you this is probably one of the coolest 2d platforming games ive ever played the puzzles arent difficult here and the platforming isnt really difficult either at first youre for the most part youre just going forward. going over obstacles, pulling items, throwing switches, and figuring out fairly simple environmental puzzles and then you run into your first enemy... and this is where things get scary... little nightmares is hands down one of my favorite horror games of all time... doing horror better than most first person games... youre hiding in the shadows, sneaking around... under tables and beds praying you dont get caught by the enemies walking around trying to eat you this is horror done right.. trying to find your way through rooms while dealing with a threat trying to get to key items and back without being seen the trial and error stealth gameplay is satisfying, and the game mixes it up with just platforming or chase sequences, so the pacing is perfect.. and gameplay feels varied... no 2 enemy encounters feel the same though there are a few frustrating moments in the game where i felt i was getting by with luck... specifically an annoying table scene that i had to keep climbing on top of and running through over and over because of the games sometimes pretty awful checkpoints and dying will be pretty frequent as this is sort of actually a 2.5 d platformer with layers this sometimes makes it hard to tell if youre going to jump at an item youre trying to grab onto and fall behind it or not but thankfully theme moments in my 4 hour journey were rare little nightmares is terrifying at times... and the level design and character design is varied and memorable.. horror games and platformer fans alike owe it to themselves to pick this one up. i give little nightmares an 8.510"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2017-04-28,"its fantastic great game , with great atmosphere and gameplay 10 from 10 . graphics very good and interesting . thanks tarsier studios !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
