"[h3]Ghoulishly delightful[/h3]

There isn't a whole lot of gameplay here, but it's still a lot of fun to work your way through each chapter and avoid the enemies. 

I didn't find the puzzles particularly difficult, they were just the right amount of challenge and fun.

The music, ambience, and art style are the real stars here. Even though the game itself was just about the perfect length, I still find myself wanting more. So, I'm excited to play the next instalment of this franchise",True,3,0,2025-02-08 13:27:42
"Little Nightmares is an awesome platforming videogame with an horrifying background and an outstanding atmosphere. A great experience with an interesting Tim Burton's aftertaste.

"This was actually such an interesting game! Short, sweet and very imaginatively designed, which also shared some striking similarities to Alice: Madness Returns, particularly with the unique combination of dream-like visuals, suspenseful ambience and uncanny character models. I really dig the art-style of these types of games, and can't wait to discover more games of a similar aesthetic.

In conclusion, I loved it. For what it's worth, I do wish it was a little longer, but I'm really excited to try Little Nightmares II and discover what unnerving things are waiting to be beheld. Recommended, I strongly suggest this game to anyone who's into Alice in Wonderland inspired games. You won't be let down :)",True,1,0,2025-02-03 10:05:21
I played the full free version of the game years ago and I liked it a lot then I bought the game and played... The controls on the PC are janky and I don't like the way they split the game into smaller parts and sell it separately. other than these issues game is so cool. solid 7/10 game,True,1,0,2025-01-28 08:31:57

Though there's one thing i didn't like is that the statue is placed on the pipes, if you fall off - that's it, no way of getting back up in there.

"good horror game, great ideas at times with some of the levels but other times a bit simplistic, movement could be a bit janky and enemy ai too.

"""Little Nightmares"" is such an ""out of the box"" experience. I don't know how to describe this GEM, this game is so CREEPY and CUTE at the same time. It's insane how these developers were able to tread that fine line so well, it paid off. I love the designs on all of the people and monsters in this game, the DLC ""The Deeps"" is definitely a treat for those with thalassophobia. This game definitely made my skin crawl! I loved every minute of the ""close calls"". Little Nightmares is a pretty short game in all fairness, it's about 3 hours (if you don't get too caught up on the puzzles).


The puzzles in this game are fun but some of them are tedious to be honest. None of them are mind bending or anything like that, everything you need is in the room that you're locked in. However, sometimes not everything is so well explained so you're lost trying to obtain the resolution for the puzzle you're spending 30+ mins on... ( yes that was me... TWICE). The controls are simple but JANKY at times. I did not enjoy the controls too much but the game wasn't that long... 


All in all, I would recommend this game to the most casual gamer, it's a fun linear game  filled with obstacles,creepy visuals and some puzzles in it. 

8/10 - Wish it was longer (DLC MADE UP FOR IT)

10/10 - VIsuals/Design ( this game is creepy and pretty)

"This is a great game! Possibly, one of the best indie games I've played.
The atmosphere and art are masterfully built to make you feel uncomfortable. More than once you feel completely powerless, at the mercy of grotesque beings. 
The puzzles throughout the game are never too difficult, but they will keep you entertained.

"This game was my childhood, i remember watching multiple videos of different youtubers playing it and now finally I was able to play this game myself. I loved it. The main story is very short in my opinion but overall is really effective and stunning, not too much. I love the concept of this game in general and something I loved dearly in this game is their use of lighting. I'm an artist and I'm a sucker for contrasts and this game was just perfect with its visuals. The puzzles were pretty  nice and they were quite easy to understand, just needs a little bit of thinking. I had to get used to the perspective of the camera and the controls and I think that was the hardest part for me lol since i kept bumping into walls.

"After, finally managing to speedrun this game and getting the final achievement. I think I can say my piece.

This is my favorite platformer/adventure game of all time. I have played through the game countless times on both PC and Playstation. I love the aesthetics and environmental story telling in this game so much. it makes me want to know more about its world. Everything in the world is larger than life. The sense of scale is amazing. You play as Six, this tiny child, and its like you're in a playhouse while everything else is out to get you. It really is a Little Nightmare.",True,0,0,2025-02-04 11:51:08

"It's a very creepy, Seuss-having-a-nightmare style where your tiny child character is seen as vermin by the obese Victorian times ""creature-adults."" If they see you they're as likely to throw you into their gaping mouths as snap your neck or squeeze the life out of you.
Constantly feasting (or making child sausage and cleaning for the upper class) they are the main threats as you try to make your way through a giant old cruise ship called the Maw. Along the way you find help and secrets as you discover the way safely from section to section. Thoroughly entertaining puzzle game.",True,0,0,2025-02-01 05:46:52

"Little Nightmares and its DLCs offer an unforgettable experience that expands the base game‚Äôs eerie world. The Secrets of the Maw DLC lets you play as the Kid, unveiling new areas and adding depth to the story.

The connections between the DLC and the base game are brilliantly executed, especially in the final scenes of The Residence chapter. Without giving too much away, the ending ties back to Six‚Äôs fate and sheds new light on the Maw‚Äôs dark secrets.

If you loved the base game, the DLC is a must play, it deepens the story and provides an emotionally resonant conclusion to the overall journey.",True,0,0,2025-01-29 09:27:44
"So I did really enjoy this game but I definitely have a few problems with it. The story and puzzle solving was really good and the atmosphere was actually so perfect, it really made you feel so small in a world full of things bigger then you. However, I think it's in part due to the fact that it's hard to make a 3D sidescroller but it would get really annoying when the depth isn't great and you just weren't at the perfect angle to pull something or hit a button, or god forbid Six just slips off the edge because you're way closer then you thought. It can get frustrating but really I didn't mind all that much, I still think it's a great game and  definitely deserves a chance.",True,0,0,2025-01-28 05:38:40

"**SHORT REVIEW**
Little Nightmares is a creepy and fun puzzle game. The world is dark and spooky, and the music and sounds really set the mood. The game play is simple but keeps you on edge as you solve puzzles and avoid creepy enemies.

The levels are well-designed, and the game tells its story through its world, not words, which makes it feel special. It‚Äôs quite short sadly (about 4-6 hours), but still REALLY fun.

If you like creepy, tense games, Little Nightmares is definitely worth playing!!!",True,0,0,2025-01-26 22:02:47

"Even with speed hacks (making the bosses kinda goofy) the puzzles are confusing af... However, for a game made in 17', it makes today's games feel like garbage. 
I've been murdering Six, Runaway goth boi and Raincoat girl for nearly 50 hours. One of the character's betrayal is nothing compared to what I've done to them. Getting killed once or twice sure, woah AHHH MY HEART! After a while it turns into Frustrating Nightmares.

"An incredible withdrawn horror game, which is loved by plenty and already can be considered a spooky classic. This is an example of the hype being absolutely valid and deserved, the game is dark, pretty, complete and all-rounded. No weak spots, no lazy writing, no sloppy ending, brilliant level design and really rich lore and atmosphere. If you are a fan of Miyazaki's work and 'Spirited Away' in particular, you'll probably fall in love. I've also encountered zero bugs both on PC and PS versions while platinuming this game. Hats off to the devs and their hard work.

"Enjoyed the atmospheric horror. Not your average 'fight back' horror. If you're looking for a laid back game but also want to feel a bit uneasy, this is the game for you. Learning a bit of the story without it being verbally explained to you is enjoyable. Also the little details that form the game, are a gem. Such as the reasoning behind the mirrors to the final boss.

I doubt you'll understand the story on your first play, but once you go back multiple times, it'll all line up eventually. If that may seem boring or overexerting, don't sweat! The game is short, but long enough to enjoy.",True,0,0,2025-01-19 17:54:23
