Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-09,"little nightmares is, without a doubt, one of the most hauntingly beautiful and atmospheric games ive ever played. its an experience that lingers with you long after the credits roll, and it quickly became one of my alltime favorites. the eerie world, the unsettling characters, and the deeply immersive narrative all come together to create a truly unforgettable game. the games art style is striking, with its twisted, dreamlike environments that are both captivating and terrifying. each area is meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of dread, and the subtle details in the worldbuilding make it feel alive, albeit in a nightmarish way. the use of lighting and sound adds layers to the atmosphere, with every creak, shadow, and distant noise keeping you on edge throughout the journey. what really hooked me, though, is the character of six. i was drawn to their quiet strength and vulnerability, and the way they moves through the world, as well as their interactions with the environment all tell a story without uttering a single word. its no surprise that i became such a fan of little nightmares, sixs character left such an impression on me that i ended up getting their character tattooed on me as a way to commemorate just how much this game meant to me, from story telling, narrative without muttering a single world, the haunts and chilling psychological horror aspects, everything. the gameplay itself is brilliant. its a mix of platforming, puzzlesolving, and stealth, all wrapped in a tense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere. the puzzles are challenging, but they never feel frustratingevery solution feels earned. the stealth mechanics are wellexecuted, and sneaking past monstrous enemies is an exhilarating experience. while the story is told in a subtle, almost cryptic way, its clear that little nightmares is about more than just escaping a nightmare. its a commentary on fear, survival, and innocence lost. the game does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're trapped in a living nightmare. if you love atmospheric, dark, and thoughtprovoking games, little nightmares is an absolute mustplay. the game doesnt just stick with you it haunts you. and for me, it became so much more than just a game, its something i carry with me, quite literally."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-15,"duuude okay let me get this straight, little nightmares is awesome. if you're hesitating whether or not to buy it, i highly recommend you do so. i haven't even got to the ending, but everything about the game so far has been amazing, especially the graphics and the atmosphere. my only criticism is that some sections can feel a bit annoying if you have to repeat them. stop reading reviews and go play the game!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-14,love the artwork. love the type of creepy it makes me feel and adrenalin rushes that come along. it's great fun. i'm replaying it to get all achievements  its just enjoyable all around in its own artsy and creepy horrorish way. thumbs up from me
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-13,"great art, great story, great sound, game controls can be a little annoying."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-12,"there aren't enough words to describe how much i love this game. i only just played it for the first time within the past few months, but i have been following this franchise since i first saw an ad for this game in around 2016. it's beautiful, whimsical, charming, all while being dark, disturbing, and haunting. this game got me through some really weird times in my life and was incredibly comforting to me, as odd as that may sound. it helped me work through abuse in a healing and forgiving way. at the same time, when i first watched a playthrough of it back when it was released, i was so disturbed. i felt like a deeply forgotten childhood trauma had been unlocked. i remembered nightmares i had as a small child where monsters would eat me alive and other such things. i remembered the helpless feeling of fear a child feels as an adult is intimidating them. i felt kind of uncomfortable i found something that resembled my nightmares as a child so much, and for a quite a while, i ignored the game so i didn't have to realize my pain. having to confront those childhood fears and misfortunes was too much for me then, but eventually, i came back to it, and i've been touched by it ever since. it's incredible to me that a game with no words can speak so much more than games or shows that are entirely driven by dialogue. i love this game, and although i know it's not everyone's cup of tea, i just sit here shocked that it doesn't have the highest rating. also, the music and sound design are beautifully done. headphones are a must."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-12,"i honestly cant stress enough how much i adore this game series! played it to 100 completion on switch, and now here i am on steam, doing it all over againbecause why not?  bring on little nightmares iii!"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-09,"with little nightmares 3 looming round the corner, i decided to replay the first one on pc since it has been a few years since my first playthrough on xbox. from the experience, the story is so good, the whole horror nature feels really eerie and well done and the dlcs are even better, the first being scary and the third one explaining a lot but also leaving you with more questions. now the controls are janky, sometimes you get stuck on a wall when running and the pov makes it hard to know the distance of most things. story does feel short as i took my time and finished it in under 5 hours. a really good project, wish it was longer and the controls were better but other than that it is definitely worth playing. i don't usually give long reviews but this is a personal favourite of mine so felt it deserved some respect and tried to keep it unbiased."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-08,"with the mix of cute and creepy, little nightmares is a a quirky burtonesque adventure that truly feels like a childhood nightmare."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-07,"this game is amazing! i love the style and the backround music,wish there was explanation to the lore andor story tho"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-06,"very good game, 100 complete the achievements, now i wait for little nightmares 3 since i completed both games"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-03,this is a very very good horror game very detailed good graphics and more
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-02,"really fun! i'm up to the janitor, he's a bit creepy but a good challenge! recommend if you want a slightly more chilled horror game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-02,"sound design. character design. story. dlc. there is nothing i don't love about this game. the achievements and dlc tiein to the main story make for a compelling and replayable game. there are things you'll notice after going through it once that just strike a chord in subsequent playthroughs and make you look at things differently. the gameplay is stressful at times, but never outright scary, making this a game for wide variety of people."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-02,"absolutely love the atmosphere, levels, the horror and everything. i just can't get enough, keep them coming."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-03-01,"little nightmares is utterly brilliant, the story telling, graphics and and overall feel of the game is hard to explain because of how great it is. the backstory of the characters give you more and more to delve into and find out, the lore is exceptional and its an overall amazing game worth the money  5 stars"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-27,"great story and moderate difficult level i'm bad at the game. overall very fun, would recommend, 910"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-27,"i spent waaay much more time in this game than i should have. it doesn't take that long to finish it even with the achievments but something about the atmosphere causes me to want to replay it every now and then. the ambient, the design, the art style, it's great."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-26,"fantastic game. lately its been my go to game. the perfect amount of suspense, challenge and atmosphere. love the series."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-25,"great characters, monsters nd puzzles"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-24,"absolutely one of the best games that i have ever played with strong lore. if you are into lore. please please checkout the comics, the little nightmares podcast as well as downloading the mobile game. there is so much back story on this it will definitely make you dive into a rabbit hole. i love this game so much. the storyline, art and especially the music. just so phenomenal and amazing in every unique way."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-24,fun and cute. i hit multiple fatal crashes in the final cutscene or other parts in game making me redo the speedrun and the final dlc having a bug where the door that's supposed to open doesn't. really lame to restart but charming and fun visuals with an interesting story bugs really blow when they do happen but cool game short worth with a discount price
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-24,ten out of ten. first time using a keyboard so everything was more stressful and terrifying. my niece enjoyed it just as much
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-23,cute creepy aesthetic game. it's fairly short and can be challenging at times. works well on steamdeck
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-23,"amazing game, great atmosphere and story telling."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-23,peak for how short the game is. after the ending im excited to play ln2 and definitely recommend trying this game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-22,great game that is filled with suspense. the only thing is that it's a little short but other then that its a great game.
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-22,"little nightmares is a series near and dear to my heart. so needless to say, i have nothing but praise for this game. whilst the controls are a bit of a learning curve, it is not at all detriment to a players enjoyment. this game is an absolute masterclass in environmental storytelling. every monster in this game is terrifying in the moment but loveable after the fact, roger the janitor is a great example of this. throughout the game the monsters are given characterisation and their stories are told purely by things you can encounter in the environment. the level of detail tarsier put into conveying and even humanising these monstrous creatures is truly outstanding. additionally, the games thematic complexity is something else i greatly enjoyed. the game particularly when considering the sequel, is an outstanding example of allegory and contains some of the most masterful examples of narrative parallels that ive seen in a game. the game is terrifying on a first playthrough, but on a later playthrough it becomes more intriguing. because of the level of detail in the environment and secret nooks and crannies, the game is highly repayable. on every replay you will notice something you didnt before, and it will add to the storyline or to the lore of the world overall. 1010 one of my favourite games ever."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-22,"i really enjoyed this game. art style is great and it's not difficult to the point where it takes away from the atmosphere. however, for pc, the mechanics regarding spacial awareness can be a little tasking, with it not being very obvious how deep to creep into the screen. the game was also pretty short. it's safe to say though that i enjoyed every bit of this game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-21,"little nightmares is nothing short of an incredible experience. the difficulty strikes a perfect balance, requiring just enough brainpower to navigate the eerie, puzzlelike environments as you move from one room to the next. the atmosphere is hauntingly immersivetruly nightmarish in every sense. at one point, you realize youre trapped on a boat, which explains the constant tilting of the screen, adding to the sense of unease. then, the real terror begins as you encounter the grotesque monsters aboard. the cooks are by far my favorite characters, with their grotesque, yet oddly captivating presence. the kitchens themselves are stunningevery detail meticulously crafted, from the animations to the chilling sound design that heightens the tension, making you feel as though youre living this nightmare alongside the protagonist. but after completing the game, one question lingers in my mind who are we, really? or perhaps more fittinglywhat have we become?"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-19,"little nightmares was so fun d it was spooky, beautiful and genuinely scared me a few times. the story line is vague and leaves a lot to be interpreted. this really adds to the overall unsettling atmosphere of playing. the soulslike moments of repeating certain portions make you feel both frustrated and satisfied. truly a wonderful game... now onto the sequel"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-19,"so much fun. beautiful puzzlehorror game, satisfying mechanics, and crazy good atmosphere. one of my favorites, and i think as an artist it will continue to inspire me to further reach my own art goals. i love six 3"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,good game worth exploring and playing. also teapot on your head 1010
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,"easily one of my most favorite horror games ever. i must admit, there is a lot of mystery around this gamearound the universe, which makes you wonder even more about the why, which i think is what makes it even more endearing. you don't know how you got there, you don't know what your true goal is  you are just being pushed immediately into this world and have to survive on your own from here and forward. the charactermonster design is insanely good and i absolutely adore the soundtrack and sound design of this game."
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-18,"fantastic game. great atmosphere the game creates, as well as the sound track. interesting characters and puzzles it has. the endings were amazing!!! 1010 game."

Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-16,"this and little nightmares 2 are the best games ever developed  by far! atmospheric, psychologically dramatic, brilliant graphics, storyline, characters, music and sound effects, and gameplay. the only problem with this game is that all others fail to compete. leaving you craving the next instalment. a"
Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-16,"very nice, linear gameplay with few intense chases. though there's one thing i didn't like is that the statue is placed on the pipes, if you fall off  that's it, no way of getting back up in there. so if you fail once, rip. inoveral, very nice. thank you!"
