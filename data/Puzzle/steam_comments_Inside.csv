Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-11,"inside is a fascinating game with a strange yet captivating story. its fun, but not something you can play for long stretches without feeling a bit drained. that said, after a while, youll find yourself wanting to jump back in during your free time. overall, its a unique and interesting experience!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"its a game where when you finish you are going to be like what have i just played, knowing its a masterpiece."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,"very decent logic platformer, nice continuation of limbo, just in escapee settings. interesting and challenging"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"i recently had a few hours of free time and decided to give the game inside a try. what i experienced was nothing short of mesmerizing. from start to finish, the game gripped me with its eerie atmosphere, clever puzzles, and a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. the games length is one of its strong suitsits not so long that it overstays its welcome, nor too short to feel incomplete. every moment is packed with intrigue, making it an experience that never becomes boring or repetitive. the puzzles are another highlight. they strike a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility, demanding just enough thought to be engaging without ever becoming frustrating. beyond gameplay, inside excels in storytelling without words. the dark, mysterious world unfolds through its stunning visuals and subtle environmental storytelling. every frame is crafted with precision, drawing players into its hauntingly beautiful world. overall, inside is a mustplay for fans of atmospheric puzzleplatformers. its masterful design and immersive experience make it one of the most memorable indie games ive played. a solid 910 in my book."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"its a great little game, not long. can be a little bit brutal... easy achievements if you are a hunter, definitely recommend it if you are after achievements"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"the visual look so gorgeous. the puzzle are really interesting. its not really hard, but sometimes you need to think for a few minute to find the solution. the story are great, even though i don't fully understand the meaning behind it. hot takes, this game is much better than limbo. recommended. 910"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"art is recognized in the details. inside is a game that speaks without words, yet tells a story more powerfully than many games filled with dialogue. every moment is meticulously crafted, with the narrative unfolding through the eerie environment, haunting sound design, fluid animation, and clever gameplay situations. there are no explanationsonly you, the world around you, and the unsettling feeling that something is terribly wrong. the physics in the game are near perfect, making every movement feel weighty and real. the way the hero stumbles, climbs, or pushes objects adds to the immersion, making you feel his fragility in this cold and oppressive world. the gameplay, though minimalist, is masterfully designed. the puzzles blend seamlessly into the environment, never feeling out of place. the sound design is simply phenomenal. theres no background music in the traditional sensejust the ambient noises of distant machinery, echoing footsteps, and moments of eerie silence that make your heart race. the atmosphere constantly shifts between tension and curiosity, keeping you on edge while pulling you deeper into its mystery. and then theres the ending. it doesnt just surpriseit shocks, unsettles, and leaves you with more questions than answers. even after the credits roll, youll find yourself staring at the screen, trying to process what you just experienced. inside is not just a gameits a masterpiece of atmosphere, storytelling, and design. it lingers in your mind long after you put it down, and thats what makes it truly unforgettable."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"lovely game with that kind of psychologicalthriller vibe to it. it's obscure and intriguing atmosphere complemented with interesting puzzles result in a beautiful game full of little details. i really enjoyed the experience, it was short but totally worth it! would love to see more like this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"another amazing game by playdead. i like this even more than limbo, such a unique experience. i love how you always feel like you're being watchedchased. one of the best puzzle platformers i've played."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"i cannot highly recommend this game enough. the gameplay is smooth. the story, while silent, does a very good job at illustrating what's going on. the learning curve isn't too bad either. you have to replay it a couple times to get all the endings and figure out all the easter eggs, which is definitely worth it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"this game is definitely giving george orwells 1984 vibes and i love it. it's eery, it's uncomfortable, it's stressful  in such a good way. wowowowow!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"recommended it when played it then, i recommend it today as well, it holds up fantastically"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,this game prove that you don't need any dialogues or any cutscences to tell an amazing story
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"great dark atmosphere, captivating music that fits the world and the game perfectly. gameplay is simple yet efficient and provides a very enjoyable experience. puzzles present enough challenge and remain engaging and fresh throughout the game as they do not repeat, and all of them have some uniqueness and cleverness to them. this all comes together in a deeply dark and orwellian world that left me wanting more. i had an amazing experience myself with this game. it is a must buy and a must play."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"this game did something not many games have done to me before disturb me. it has a certain dystopian atmosphere, and despite the ending being a good one, it still feels.. uneasy. the game does a great job at what it sets out to do, and i applaud it for being one of the most immersive puzzle platformers i've ever played."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"further improving on the limbo formula by a long shot, playdead's inside is a remarkable feat of cinematic gaming. the nuanced gameplay and intricate puzzles are engaging, and the superb sound design, amazing animations and lighting compositions really immerse you in the storyrich world of inside."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"this game is amazing. 1010 the animations, the graphics, the sounds, the scenery, .... a must play"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"quite an immersive, engaging, interesting, creative and philosophical game, to be honest. i really, really enjoyed playing this game all the way twice. the first time i played it like usual and the second was to collect all those collectibles to get all the achievements, which i did. highly recommended for gamers and other people to try it out and voice their respective opinions. thanks."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-10,"like playdead's other game limbo, inside is filled with a lot of really cool puzzles and situations. but it's even better. definitely one of the best puzzle platformers i've ever played. i'd love to see more games from this developer, they seem to excel at this genre."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-10,"this game is a masterpiece. its haunting atmosphere, smooth gameplay, and subtle storytelling creates an unforgettable experience that stays with you long after you finish it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-09,"this game is a really cool experience, it's not very long but it left me speechless, the ambiance either visual or audio is really well done, the animations are awesome, i've rarely seen such good animations in a game, and the gameplay is really fun and make you think multiple times of how to do something, in short it's a good game that's really cool to play. and if you also like dark universes like limbo, little nightmares, or games that have a similar feeling, you will definitively like inside a lot."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-08,"the whole story line is superb. the controls and the gameplay. amazing. it sounds like horror but not horror, just keeping u edge away. must play."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i was very enthusiastic about limbo, both in terms of the concept and the amazing design. i liked inside as a conceptual successor even more. the eerie atmosphere, the dark setting and the overall game design of inside are impressive, a true work of art. the already great concept of limbo has been coherently expanded and improved in many respects. the game is very straightforward, you are thrown directly into the story without any explanation, the story only gradually reveals itself, but in many aspects it remains vague and open to interpretation until the end. it was very exciting to explore the game world with all its deadly dangers. compared to limbo, i often found the challenging puzzles and tests of skill much less frustrating. they never stopped me from enjoying the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i absolutely love inside. i think it is a perfect 2d puzzle platformer. i have already beaten it on the switch, but i just had to get it on steam and replay it again. it is creepy, stressful, and captivating. the art direction, the sound design, and the animations are all masterfully done. i also really like the handheld movement on the camera. it makes the game feel very immersive and cinematic. it may be a short experience but inside is the perfect example of quality over quantity."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,great experience with many memorable moments. amazing atmosphere coupled with thoughtprovoking extravagant storytelling with unexpectedly satisfying gameplay.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"a masterpiece of atmosphere and puzzle platforming inside by playdead is nothing short of a masterpiece. if you're a fan of atmospheric puzzleplatformers, this game should be at the top of your list. the game is visually stunning, featuring a dark, moody world that is full of mystery and tension. every scene is crafted with incredible attention to detail, with an eerie atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. the gameplay is simple but effective. you control a young boy navigating through a dystopian world filled with peril. the puzzles are integrated seamlessly into the environment, making each section feel like an organic part of the story. while the puzzles themselves aren't overly complex, they require you to think critically about how to progress, and the solutions are always satisfying when you figure them out. the real strength of inside lies in its ability to tell a gripping story without a single word of dialogue. the narrative is delivered through the environment, actions, and subtle details, creating an emotional connection to the protagonist and a desire to uncover the truth behind the strange world youre exploring. every moment is filled with tension, and the atmosphere alone is enough to make you feel both curious and unnerved. the games sound design is equally impressive, with ambient noises and a minimalist soundtrack that perfectly complements the worldbuilding. the sound effects help immerse you in the experience, whether it's the distant hum of machinery or the unsettling sounds of the world around you. while the game is relatively short, it's packed with memorable moments and puzzles that stay with you long after you finish. the pacing is excellent, and the ending, though open to interpretation, will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. overall, inside is a brilliant and haunting experience. it's a game that excels in atmosphere, narrative, and puzzle design. if you enjoy games that evoke emotion and make you think, this one is a mustplay. rating 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i've played this twice now and somehow my second playthrough hit even harder, it's been a while so i can't fully remember but what an incredible experience even the second time around... genuinely so few games can hope to capture the incredible beauty of inside. it's simply stunning in every way, fully recommend. the sound design and lighting in particular are stellar and elevate this beyond anything else. 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-05,"every moment of the game is satisfying. the environmental storytelling is a masterpiece, and i love how the atmosphere captures simple details and makes them even more captivating. i keep coming back to play this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"this is a really interesting, fun and short game that makes you feel a lot of things. at first you begin the game right off the main menu screen seamlessly which was a really cool idea and like it a lot. you are seemingly a little boy in a really strange world but by the end there are a lot of theories what exactly is happening but you can read them yourself. this is an indie game everyone should play and own at some point if you haven't."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"overall highly recommend, even for people like me who usually do not enjoy puzzle games. pros  astonishingly simplistic graphics that make for beautiful, powerful scenery  fantastic sound design  smooth and dynamic animation  intriguing worldbuilding  an ending that changes the context of the entire game up until that point for me  perfectly balanced puzzle difficulty for people like me who are quickly frustrated by games like this, did not once have to get help from the internet to solve any of the puzzles and yet they were difficult enough to be a fun challenge and satisfying to figure out, getting stuck for no longer than 10 minutes at the most difficult puzzles  lots of room for interpretation and theories  simple controls  introductions of game mechanics are weaved subtly into the gameplay itself without any outright tutorial throwing too much information at you at once  genuinely suspenseful at times, in the kind of way that makes you hold your breath and press the buttons on the keyboard down way too hard even though you know it won't make you run faster  merciful, well thoughtout checkpoints which prevent you having to redo annoying sections of the map just to get back to a difficult part of a puzzle without dying  curiosity driving a need for exploration which is granted tenfold in this game  this game does not spell everything out for you and allows you to explore, interpret, experiment and be immersed  the gameplay and mechanics are built upon, evolved and spiced up at a satisfying pace to prevent gameplay becoming stale or too repetitive  short and snappy, nothing felt like filler content, i completed the game in just over 4 hours  all puzzles have logical solutions, unlike some other puzzle games where it feels like the only way to find the answer is pure luck potential cons  while most did not, a few puzzles involved timed stuff, which i am not too big a fan of. but these were rare, usually not that difficult and had closeby checkpoints to easily try again  i would not recommend this game to people who do not like heavy topics such as violence or mind control. this game is beautiful! but in a scary, bleak and occasionally sad way  far as i can tell you cannot pet the dogs  at the very start i had to go into the settings to see which button you had to press to interact with stuff, i personally did not mind this since it was only one single button i had to check one single time the controls are very simple but to all you tutorialenjoyers out there it could be a pet peeve at the start maybe it also showed me the button but i was too dumb to see it or something, this was just my experience conclusion i do not like platformers. i do not like puzzle games. this one changed my mind."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"i did not expect to love this game as much as i did. the controls are so simple, but the complexities and sheer variety of puzzles coupled with the intricate depthdefying level design of a 2d environment really made me feel compelled to see that happens next. it felt like a bad dream in a good way."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"best use of show, dont tell. you'll see why the game is called inside later, it's a short 2hour puzzle platformer with some really well thought of puzzles and mechanics, and it frequently drops on a 90 sale. even if not on sale, highly recommend everyone to experience this once in their life."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"an amazing game. it a couple notches above limbo and it really shows. a gripping story where you don't understand what's going on. as you go on, some pieces might make sense, but on the whole no explanation is provided. haven't finished it yet, right at the end, but if you're looking for a game that makes your brain work, this is it. interesting puzzles, amazing world building, eery atmosphere and a unique look are things that make this game a must have if you like brain storming in your games. fully recommended."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"fantastically dark, fun puzzles  great mechanics!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game is the perfect embodiment show don't tell. the atmosphere and world building are probably the best i've ever seen in a platformer. it builds the world without any dialogue, but with great visuals, intricate gameplaypuzzles, and an amazing soundtrack. there's also dozens of secrets that only further rewards players with a keen eye with extra story beats. definitely a must buy for anybody."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game very emotional content , dont like little nightmare .. this game very straight lane storyline you just move foward very easy to play .. the puzzle very realistic enviroment . you should play this game"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"i don't really have much to say about this game, positive or negative. the atmosphere and aesthetics are great and the creative team clearly put in a lot of effort to bring out the mysterious and creepy vibe that they were trying to. a for that. the puzzles were okay. nothing felt particularly challenging but i also wasn't bored while playing. if you're someone who prioritises game play over everything else in a game then maybe you'd be better off with a different puzzle game. overall, solid few hours of entertainment and i can understand why steam has this at a 96 positive reviews."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,very good looking game incredibly interesting storyline and great atmosphere!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,after almost 20 hours of playing this game i still havent completed it so there are definitely a lot of levels and puzzles. if you get this game on sale like i did just for 2 euros then its a w and underrated. but if you buy it at full price 20 euros then its still goated but kinda mid cuz of the price
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,"i never even knew about this game until my wife told me about it after she saw some people playing it on tiktok. it was one of those rare occasions where she was really interested in playing something, so i got it and found out it was by the same developers as limbo, which i had played in the past. i got the bundle and sat there watching her play while offering ideas on how to solve different puzzles. they weren't that hard, in my opinion. we completed it in under 8 hours, including achievements. it's a short, quick game that may seem challenging for some players who haven't developed the habit of backtracking or mapping out an entire zone before advancing, or timing out some of the puzzles the shockwave one was the trickiest at the end with the rotating thing, but it's enjoyable overall. i liked the fact that it quick saves after each puzzle, so you don't have to go through a lot of solved stuff again. storywise, well, you just have to piece most of it together in your mind and come up with your own theories. personally, i would've liked more chases like in the beginning since those are what sold the game to us in those tiktoks with people playing it. it's a really cool game, but i still think that limbo is far superiorcreepier, darker, and scarier."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,gameplay time is not as long as limbo but the graphics and the gameplay is way more interesting. the fact that the surrounding and the characters are more realistic makes the game more fun.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"fucking amazing game, great story"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,inside a must play game. its a puzzle adventure game just finished it and loved the whole journey!! the story goes like how a unknown factory runs test on humans and we the child stops it by completing multiple puzzles the puzzles are very good with a little twists. dont read any more reviews just go and play this!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,a game was really fun with a good graphic and a good story i loved
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"incredible game, the artwork, storyline and interactions are all well thought out and executed. refined, elegant and clean. thoroughly enjoyed this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"huge improvement over the developer's previous game, limbo. inside is creepy and a ton of fun. the dark and dismal world is bizarre and fascinating. the puzzles are intuitive but require some thought to work out. i enjoyed this game thoroughly, though i wasn't crazy about the anticlimactic ending."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,one of the greatest indie games of all times. inside tells a story which lets you decide what is going on. simple and effective graphics and gameplay. definitely worth a buy if you can catch this game and limbo on sale.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"very good game, just like limbo. would love for it to be longer, and for the devs to make more games"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"h1stellar sidescroller story tellingh1 what an interesting story and concept, i'd liken its mechanics and fidelity to little nightmares. very well put together, a masterpiece of art, with a story that will have you asking what's really going on, and with a splash of horror."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"its a really nice game. you are thrown into a world without any explanation, and that never change, because even now i am confused about what happened, what it was trying to say, or what the hell was going on. but that lack of explanation is actually charming after a while. i definitely recommend playing this game to anybody who is up for approx. 6 hours of total confusion and occasional laughter. personally i would rate this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"incredible how such a simple game can transmit so much fear, surprises and tension. also curiosity. i believe this is a masterpiece concept of a game. despite being 2.5d it is super entertaining and well worth going through it for both endings. recommended!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-25,"h1 1010 h1 sorry that i'm comparing it to little nightmares, has a similar wibe.. this game is super depressive and unsettling in an amazing way! the graphics are both simple and beautiful and unsettling, the sounds fit perfectly. i'm not 100 sure what is going on with the story but it's fine, it does not answer all my questions which is ok. littlenightmares was more scarry, it had more horror elements, it was more grotex. inside is more grounded, yet it is just as unsettling as lnm or maybe even a little more, which is nice. the puzzles are really creative and fun and require both thinking and timing but not in a irritating amount. there are many checkpoints, so i did not have to replay already done sections over and over again which is a great plus. i had many ahaaa and oh nooo and oh yeahhh moments. the first playthrough was 3 hours, maybe i will go for all the hidden stuff, otherwise there is not much replayability, same as at lnm. 100 recommended, especially for that nobrainer 12 usdeur current price which contains their other game as well which i did not play yet.. inside was more recommended and i can see why it was so well received"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"great game, love puzzles mixed in with a game that makes you ask questions about whats going on, if you like a mystery game with a good puzzle then this is for you"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"an excellent game of puzzle solving in a very atmospheric setting. very enjoyable, brilliant."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"a quite unique atmosphere, nice animation and fluid movement, entertaining and accessible puzzles. i am very happy to have had the opportunity to play this game. 100 recommend!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"beautiful. atmospheric, ominous, surprising, surreal. satisfying puzzle design that balances challenge with environmental hints."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"another terrific, sidescrolling platform game that told its dark and compelling story through constant movement and action. i finished it in 3.5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"absolutely amazing game. visually stunning. mechanics are wonderful and fluid. kept me asking questions and begging for answers that leave me with more mystery than when i went in. i'm so curious about the universe and what led to the events of this game. i love being given the freedom to figure it out myself or try and put together the lore in my own assumptions. wonderful journey we get to go on, i loved how interesting and challenging the puzzles were. great job! inside my playthrough httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v3jqyw5v2q5yt7176s"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-20,"such a neat little game. a perfect game for those interested in atmospheric horror, puzzles, and stories that leave you scratching your head. i wish i could forget it so that i could experience it all over again."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"amusing to play but too easy especially if you played limbo. i wish it was more challenging. however, unlike limbo, it is generally shocking in the way the kid dies by gunshots and torn by dogs and the alternative reality. it gives lots of moments of what just happened?."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"what a fantastic game. the art style is definitely simplistic, but the amount of detail and effort gone into it all  the backgrounds, the lighting, etc.  a good bit of which you may never see, is stunning. i started off considering it a lot alike unravelunravel 2, but without even having a unique gameplay mechanic like that does, but it constantly improved upon itself and really blew me away. the balance between the challenge and a consistent pace of progression was really impressive, and only rarely annoying if figuring something out meant trips back and forth between spots. there are also really neat mechanics, which don't really stop being introduced even until the very end, but never confuse or overwhelm. inside's atmosphere is also utterly striking. as i touched on, i was skeptical early on, but at some point my cynicism faded away without my noticing and i was just totally immersed in the moment. the sound design is amazing and the nature of this absurd world is really easy to be intrigued by. along with that, there's a brilliant story, all told without any dialogue. i'm a huge fan of television and movies and have an absurd amount to watch in each of those mediums, so when i play a video game i'm never looking for a movie that i have to pay money to sit at my computer and press buttons at, i want something utilising this medium in specific. luckily, inside does this incredibly. as i already mentioned, all of the gameplay is very engaging, but the game in terms of visual storytelling utilises the video game medium and makes something that would undeniably be inferior as something else. spoilerrealising that the character you played as was only a vessel for the story, to be thrown away as an amalgamation of other people, just as people are dispensable in the corporate world we live in that this game depicts, is enough to make your heart sink. people are born as a product here, a child who makes it out has slipped through the cracks of this cold system, and once his path, unstoppable by your input, turns him into a monster, the masses turn on him while the individuals help him. he is cast out completely as a monster, but there is a sunny spot left for him where he may stay as long as he pleases. spoiler there's so much to reflect on in this game, but feeling it in the moment was incredible. loved this. 810"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"inside got me thinking a lot when i finished playing it the first time. i really enjoy dystopian games, movies, shows, books. great design and game play. the art style is spot on with the ambiance of the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-18,"masterfully executed platformer, with a world building and a backstory that will hit you hard and leave a lasting impact long after you've played it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-17,"good, spooky game with nice mechanics and a nice puzzle style approach. enjoyed it!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-17,"finished my second playthrough and i'm blown away again by how great this little game is. it's not the longest but certainly worth it. challening puzzles, eerie and spooky atmosphere, and amazing artwork and sound. definitely recommend this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-17,extremely cool little game with an awesome atmosphere and intriguing setting. even a little scary sometimes.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-17,in my experience inside is very simple yet a very deep game. the puzzles can be challenging at times but in the end are very simple if you check your surroundings. i am not sure what the lore of the game is however through my first play through i've taken notes and wrote down theories for the events that happen in the game. overall for the price and experience of the game it is amazing. i would recommend this game if you want an in depth and lore rich experience.

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-13,"for a short game, i still enjoy it. i do however like the alternative ending, because it has a 4th wall break in a way, you're not in control of your character anymore."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-12,"beautiful graphics, dark interactions, smart puzzles, awesome game all the way around! highly recommend!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"for a game that at first glance may seem like a walking simulator, it's genuinely still decent as a game, and as a silent story. wish the game was longer due to its linear gameplay for reference, i was able to complete the main story  collectable aside  in three hours wo a guide, and at 20 without a sale, it's a questionable pricing by modern standards. but as it goes frequently on sale for 1.99 usd  you should be able to pick up the game for pretty cheap eventually. while it may not per say be the most visually impressive game of all time, for a 2016 indie title, you have to give credit for how nice the game looks  in particular the underwater bubbling is pretty neat. beyond that, i don't have much to say in regards to it without going into spoilers, but as someone who doesn't typically find reaction to games  and even though i find traditional jumpscare horror to be ineffective once you get used to it  i do believe the game has its moments where you will feel dread and some disgust in moments. in short  if the game interests you, i highly recommend picking up on sale, rather than full price  due to its short runtime. but once you do find that opportunity, i think it'll keep you company once playing the first time around."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"is freedom real, or is it just another illusion created by the very systems we seek to escape? these are the questions that inside left me with. at first glance, inside is a dark, eerie puzzleplatformer, but as i played, i realized it wasnt just about survival. the game explores society, control, and the unsettling truth that even rebellion can be manipulated. control, society, and the power structures at play one of the games core mechanics is the ability to control other people using a headsetlike device. some individuals are reduced to mindless puppets, obeying orders without resistance. others are imprisoned  caged but left alive, as if they serve no purpose beyond being contained. to me, this is a direct reflection of how society functions. capitalism, politics, and power structures are designed to control and use people. some are turned into obedient workers, while others, deemed useless, are simply locked away and ignored. the game doesnt show an active oppressor  it presents a system that maintains itself, where control is the default state. why a boy? the rebellious nature of youth the choice of protagonist  a young boy  stood out to me. unlike the controlled and imprisoned adults, the boy is vulnerable  every mistake results in death. this reflects how only at a young age do we question the system and try to break free. when you are young, you ask, why is society like this? how can i escape it? as you grow older, you either conform or exhaust yourself trying. the boy represents that phase of life where rebellion feels possible. but inside punishes every misstep harshly  just as society does to those who refuse to conform. the huddle a trap for revolutionaries eventually, the boy reaches the huddle, a grotesque mass of bodies. some players see this as a horrifying fate, but i see something more the huddle is made up of those who tried to break free before him. they werent destroyed  they were absorbed. maybe they were once rebels, just like the boy. maybe they tried to resist and were captured, studied, and turned into something controllable. even in its united form, the huddle remains connected to machines, still under control. this is one of the games most unsettling messages even revolution can be manipulated. even the strongest rebellion can be contained. does freedom even exist? at the end of the game, the huddle escapes  or so it seems. after crashing through barriers, it finally reaches a peaceful, sunlit area. and then nothing. the game just stops. no resolution, no victory. just silence. was this freedom? or a designed endpoint where the system knew it would end up all along? to me, this is insides final, haunting message if everything is built inside, then outside has no meaning. the boy believes he can find true freedom outside, but what if there is no outside? the world is structured to contain every possibility  including escape. if there is no true out"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"this game teaches you its mechanics by killing you until you get it. the ingame tutorial is almost nonexistent. would be a neutral review, but tends more towards positive."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"haunting, fun, and stays with you inside is one of those games that sucks you in right from the start and doesnt let go. theres no handholding, no dialoguejust you, a boy, and a world that feels unsettling in all the right ways. the gameplay is smooth, with clever puzzles and platforming that never feel frustrating, but what really makes this game special is the atmosphere. its eerie, mysterious, and full of moments that make you stop and wonder what the hell is actually going on. and the best part? everyone walks away with a different interpretation of the story. is it about control? free will? a dystopian nightmare? something even stranger? inside never gives you clear answers, and thats what makes it so brilliant. if you love games that are fun but also make you think and maybe even haunt you a little after youre done, this is a mustplay."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-20,"inside is a masterfully crafted puzzleplatformer that showcases the brilliance of playdead, the developers behind the iconic limbo. building on their signature style, inside offers a dark, atmospheric journey that is equal parts haunting and captivating. the game's minimalist approach to storytelling draws players into its mysterious world, leaving much to interpretation. the visuals are stunning, with a striking use of light, shadow, and sound that amplifies the eerie tone. the puzzles are clever and seamlessly integrated into the environment, ensuring the gameplay remains engaging from start to finish. as a big fan of limbo, inside feels like an evolution of that same eerie charm, delivering a more refined experience with deeper emotional weight. it's an unforgettable journey that lingers with you long after the credits roll. highly recommended for fans of atmospheric and thoughtprovoking games."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-23,"it's so simple, but the execution is so well done, that those few hours i spent in the game were really cool. will always remember it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-01,"inside is a puzzleplatformer set in a bleak, dystopian world. we control an unnamed boy, navigating through the environment as we solve puzzles to carry on. deadly threats loom throughout and must be avoided in various ways. the story is open to interpretation, with no dialogue and only visual cues to guide us along. the game is artistically beautiful, replete with dark silhouette designs. this is a fairly short adventure but is a memorable, innovative experience."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-11,"inside is a fascinating game with a strange yet captivating story. its fun, but not something you can play for long stretches without feeling a bit drained. that said, after a while, youll find yourself wanting to jump back in during your free time. overall, its a unique and interesting experience!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-16,"inside is quite a particular game, from the creators of limbo. it follows a similar gameplay loop, and even the way the story is told or rather, not told is also along the same lines. however, where i found limbo to be somewhat frustrating, i found myself enjoying this game quite a whole lot, even if i still had my issues with it. our story begins with an unnamed boy in an unnamed forest, being chased around by an unnamed group. and, as it stands, the whole game is like that we get to see a lot of stuff happen, but we never get clear answers as to how this worlds works, only that it looks somewhat dystopian, and dare i say, decaying. usually, i don't enjoy vague stories such as this one, but inside had something in it that kept me going forward, wanting to, if not learn, at least see more of this world. i can't go into a lot more details about the story, as i feel doing so would spoil the experience, and this game is certainly an experience. as for the gameplay, i already mentioned it's simlar to limbo. in case you're unfamiliar, it's a thirdperson platformer with puzzles and a small touch of exploration. there's no combat perse, whenever there's enemies, or, as i'd prefer to call them in this case, hostile elements, your usual course of action is either avoiding them through stealth or outrunning them. other than that, you'll have to move boxes, pull switches, push objects... lots of puzzles sprinkled throughout the game. personally, i found this part of the game and the exploration itself to be the better part of it in regards to the presence of hostile elements, the dogs in particular, i found them somewhat annoying. sound design is quite minimal, but where the game makes use of sound, it makes an impact. musical cues, soundtracks that faintly play in the background, i think it's all excellently crafted. and the art style is fantastic as well. while the gameplay remains 2d, the game makes good use of 3d environments, and the level design is great. sure, you won't get to that platform far away in the background, but seeing it gives this game a huge sense of scale. all in all, a solid experience, with an eerie atmosphere bordering on horror. i definitely recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-22,"i was genuinely surprised by how dark this minimalist game could become. its storyrich narrative, paired with sidescrolling puzzle platforming, strikes the perfect balance of challenge and engagement. as they say, a good puzzle makes the solver think they will get it. a great puzzle makes them feel smart when they do."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-02,"good game, i liked it!  similar in style to limbo, but an improved experience for me."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-15,"i think this game was a good experience, but i'm not recommending it because the ending or, in my opinion, the lack of one was terrible and a detriment to the overall experience, and i feel the need to stress that with how many positive reviews there are. the game threw me right into the actionalmost literallyand i was pleasantly surprised by how well that worked. i hesitate to call the puzzles particularly challenging, but they weren't overly easy either. they were enjoyable. the hardest puzzles were the ones with platforming, but even those were solvable after many tries. however, while the game's minimalistic approach to story tellingbuilding was very engaging, the game'squite franklyweird and open ended ending very quickly nullified all my investment into this world and its...story? i'm not going to spoil what the ending is, but it was like if a dragon ate the heroine on the last episode of a scifi show, right before she could reveal what her ultimate goal for this journey was. leaving me with questions such as, so what was that entire journey for?, when did dragons come into play?, what was the point of this story?, and, most importantly, what the f?!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-16,"controversial. yes, in the end i checked the box for recommending the game, but there is a but that lies in the fact it's not my genre a 2.5d platform game and i realized it only started playing it. one of the reasons i don't mark it as i don't recommend this game is because i didn't expect anything from it from the beginning and when i was buying it i was aware the game could turn out to be not my favotire genre. another reason is that despite the platform, i was curious about the story. its ending reserves many questions which is not bad at all. if you're not sure about the game same as i wasn't sure about it for some time but want to discover a new type of games, i'd recommend to take a chance."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-05,"amazing environmental storytelling. the ending was clever and satisfying. however, this is in dire need of an editor because it is way too long for what it is. the beginning is excellent, as it sets up the mystery and puts you into the world, and nothing overstays its welcome as it shows you something new about every 30 seconds, which is about correct for a gameplaylight walking simulator where you're mostly just moving forwards. but towards the middle of the game, the world grows larger and larger making your progress slow down significantly. this would be fine, except not only did they just start reusing ideas, none of which were particularly difficult puzzles in the first place, more than a couple areas of the game particularly the mermaid part are just extremely tedious. would be a strong recommendation if it was about an hour shorterif you start to get bored, maybe just look up a playthrough on youtube."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"i recently had a few hours of free time and decided to give the game inside a try. what i experienced was nothing short of mesmerizing. from start to finish, the game gripped me with its eerie atmosphere, clever puzzles, and a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. the games length is one of its strong suitsits not so long that it overstays its welcome, nor too short to feel incomplete. every moment is packed with intrigue, making it an experience that never becomes boring or repetitive. the puzzles are another highlight. they strike a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility, demanding just enough thought to be engaging without ever becoming frustrating. beyond gameplay, inside excels in storytelling without words. the dark, mysterious world unfolds through its stunning visuals and subtle environmental storytelling. every frame is crafted with precision, drawing players into its hauntingly beautiful world. overall, inside is a mustplay for fans of atmospheric puzzleplatformers. its masterful design and immersive experience make it one of the most memorable indie games ive played. a solid 910 in my book."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-20,"this game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and intrigue, offering a truly unique experience that lingers long after the credits roll. the puzzles are just the right level of difficultynot too easy, not too hardand they feel incredibly interactive with the environment. its not just about solving puzzles you really have to observe your surroundings, think critically, and make use of the world around you to progress. the lore is another standout aspect. its mysterious and intentionally vague, leaving you to piece things together through your own observations and interpretations. the game doesnt spoonfeed you answers, and thats part of what makes it so engaging. its a world where you feel like a small part of a much larger, unsettling narrative, and figuring out whats going on is as much about perception as it is about puzzlesolving. atmospherewise, inside nails it. the dark, gloomy dystopian setting envelops you from start to finish. the background objects and events make the environment feel alive, and youre simply caught up in this eerie world while trying to escape it. the sound design and music perfectly complement the tone of the game, creating tension and dread without overplaying it. one particular highlight for me was the physics of the game. it adds to the immersion, making each moment feel more intense. the parts with the dog chasing you, especially, had me on edge. the dogs movements, sounds, and the overall physics made those sequences feel so realit really made my heart race. the game isnt overly long, but it doesnt need to be. it delivers a compact but thoroughly thrilling experience, and the mystery of the dystopian world stays with you long after you finish. if you enjoy atmospheric puzzle games with a touch of dark, psychological storytelling, inside is definitely worth playing."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"art is recognized in the details. inside is a game that speaks without words, yet tells a story more powerfully than many games filled with dialogue. every moment is meticulously crafted, with the narrative unfolding through the eerie environment, haunting sound design, fluid animation, and clever gameplay situations. there are no explanationsonly you, the world around you, and the unsettling feeling that something is terribly wrong. the physics in the game are near perfect, making every movement feel weighty and real. the way the hero stumbles, climbs, or pushes objects adds to the immersion, making you feel his fragility in this cold and oppressive world. the gameplay, though minimalist, is masterfully designed. the puzzles blend seamlessly into the environment, never feeling out of place. the sound design is simply phenomenal. theres no background music in the traditional sensejust the ambient noises of distant machinery, echoing footsteps, and moments of eerie silence that make your heart race. the atmosphere constantly shifts between tension and curiosity, keeping you on edge while pulling you deeper into its mystery. and then theres the ending. it doesnt just surpriseit shocks, unsettles, and leaves you with more questions than answers. even after the credits roll, youll find yourself staring at the screen, trying to process what you just experienced. inside is not just a gameits a masterpiece of atmosphere, storytelling, and design. it lingers in your mind long after you put it down, and thats what makes it truly unforgettable."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,the game combines horror with strategy. it's very short but definitely worth the 1.99.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"inside is a short indie game with solid puzzle solving elements, and a story that will keep you curious. inside's story is told entirely through its visuals, with no human dialogue to speak of. its dull, watercolouresque visuals paints a clear picture of the dull reality in which the boy must survive. the story, however simple, is told very competently through these visuals, invoking feeling of unease and curiosity. additionally, the game offers collectables in the form of futuristiclooking orbs that you can dismantle. an alternative ending is present if they are all dismantled, providing some closure to the boy's story. despite it's 2 hour run time, perhaps 3 if you're going for all the collectables, inside provides an experience i am pleased to recommend."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"how the heck did they come up with this idea  it's incredible. although the game is short, it's evident the developers put a lot of work into this. short but sweet, as they say. i'm very picky with games  at one time i went without playing for years and years as i just got disinterested in all the various games that came out. this one is the first game i've played in a very long time, where i can't stop playing. it reminds me of dark souls that same kind of addiction 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"i played it blind, and the ending really amazed me! the puzzles and general visual and sound design were all great, in my opinion. really liked playing it, though after replaying a couple times, after finding all items, i stopped. it's totally worth the experience on a sale, i think, although at full price it's probably not worth it. it's only a couple hours of gameplay i think, and it's very linear. extremely superb atmospheric storytelling and story pacing, regardless. controls were easy to get the hang of too!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"inside, a phenomenal dark puzzle game that explores themes of control and to break free from said control. the atmosphere is incredibly eerie, perfectly complementing the dystopian setting. the ending is intentionally vague leaving players with head scratching moments but if you pay attention to the to details and connect the pieces of the puzzle, a picture begins to form. although the plot still remains open to interpretation which is something i personally love in games, it invites speculation and discussion among players and fans. overall, i consider inside a true work of art and i highly recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"lovely game with that kind of psychologicalthriller vibe to it. it's obscure and intriguing atmosphere complemented with interesting puzzles result in a beautiful game full of little details. i really enjoyed the experience, it was short but totally worth it! would love to see more like this."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"i cannot highly recommend this game enough. the gameplay is smooth. the story, while silent, does a very good job at illustrating what's going on. the learning curve isn't too bad either. you have to replay it a couple times to get all the endings and figure out all the easter eggs, which is definitely worth it."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"this game did something not many games have done to me before disturb me. it has a certain dystopian atmosphere, and despite the ending being a good one, it still feels.. uneasy. the game does a great job at what it sets out to do, and i applaud it for being one of the most immersive puzzle platformers i've ever played."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"further improving on the limbo formula by a long shot, playdead's inside is a remarkable feat of cinematic gaming. the nuanced gameplay and intricate puzzles are engaging, and the superb sound design, amazing animations and lighting compositions really immerse you in the storyrich world of inside."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-08,"the whole story line is superb. the controls and the gameplay. amazing. it sounds like horror but not horror, just keeping u edge away. must play."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i was very enthusiastic about limbo, both in terms of the concept and the amazing design. i liked inside as a conceptual successor even more. the eerie atmosphere, the dark setting and the overall game design of inside are impressive, a true work of art. the already great concept of limbo has been coherently expanded and improved in many respects. the game is very straightforward, you are thrown directly into the story without any explanation, the story only gradually reveals itself, but in many aspects it remains vague and open to interpretation until the end. it was very exciting to explore the game world with all its deadly dangers. compared to limbo, i often found the challenging puzzles and tests of skill much less frustrating. they never stopped me from enjoying the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i absolutely love inside. i think it is a perfect 2d puzzle platformer. i have already beaten it on the switch, but i just had to get it on steam and replay it again. it is creepy, stressful, and captivating. the art direction, the sound design, and the animations are all masterfully done. i also really like the handheld movement on the camera. it makes the game feel very immersive and cinematic. it may be a short experience but inside is the perfect example of quality over quantity."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,great experience with many memorable moments. amazing atmosphere coupled with thoughtprovoking extravagant storytelling with unexpectedly satisfying gameplay.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"a masterpiece of atmosphere and puzzle platforming inside by playdead is nothing short of a masterpiece. if you're a fan of atmospheric puzzleplatformers, this game should be at the top of your list. the game is visually stunning, featuring a dark, moody world that is full of mystery and tension. every scene is crafted with incredible attention to detail, with an eerie atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. the gameplay is simple but effective. you control a young boy navigating through a dystopian world filled with peril. the puzzles are integrated seamlessly into the environment, making each section feel like an organic part of the story. while the puzzles themselves aren't overly complex, they require you to think critically about how to progress, and the solutions are always satisfying when you figure them out. the real strength of inside lies in its ability to tell a gripping story without a single word of dialogue. the narrative is delivered through the environment, actions, and subtle details, creating an emotional connection to the protagonist and a desire to uncover the truth behind the strange world youre exploring. every moment is filled with tension, and the atmosphere alone is enough to make you feel both curious and unnerved. the games sound design is equally impressive, with ambient noises and a minimalist soundtrack that perfectly complements the worldbuilding. the sound effects help immerse you in the experience, whether it's the distant hum of machinery or the unsettling sounds of the world around you. while the game is relatively short, it's packed with memorable moments and puzzles that stay with you long after you finish. the pacing is excellent, and the ending, though open to interpretation, will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. overall, inside is a brilliant and haunting experience. it's a game that excels in atmosphere, narrative, and puzzle design. if you enjoy games that evoke emotion and make you think, this one is a mustplay. rating 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i've played this twice now and somehow my second playthrough hit even harder, it's been a while so i can't fully remember but what an incredible experience even the second time around... genuinely so few games can hope to capture the incredible beauty of inside. it's simply stunning in every way, fully recommend. the sound design and lighting in particular are stellar and elevate this beyond anything else. 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-05,"every moment of the game is satisfying. the environmental storytelling is a masterpiece, and i love how the atmosphere captures simple details and makes them even more captivating. i keep coming back to play this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"this is a really interesting, fun and short game that makes you feel a lot of things. at first you begin the game right off the main menu screen seamlessly which was a really cool idea and like it a lot. you are seemingly a little boy in a really strange world but by the end there are a lot of theories what exactly is happening but you can read them yourself. this is an indie game everyone should play and own at some point if you haven't."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"overall highly recommend, even for people like me who usually do not enjoy puzzle games. pros  astonishingly simplistic graphics that make for beautiful, powerful scenery  fantastic sound design  smooth and dynamic animation  intriguing worldbuilding  an ending that changes the context of the entire game up until that point for me  perfectly balanced puzzle difficulty for people like me who are quickly frustrated by games like this, did not once have to get help from the internet to solve any of the puzzles and yet they were difficult enough to be a fun challenge and satisfying to figure out, getting stuck for no longer than 10 minutes at the most difficult puzzles  lots of room for interpretation and theories  simple controls  introductions of game mechanics are weaved subtly into the gameplay itself without any outright tutorial throwing too much information at you at once  genuinely suspenseful at times, in the kind of way that makes you hold your breath and press the buttons on the keyboard down way too hard even though you know it won't make you run faster  merciful, well thoughtout checkpoints which prevent you having to redo annoying sections of the map just to get back to a difficult part of a puzzle without dying  curiosity driving a need for exploration which is granted tenfold in this game  this game does not spell everything out for you and allows you to explore, interpret, experiment and be immersed  the gameplay and mechanics are built upon, evolved and spiced up at a satisfying pace to prevent gameplay becoming stale or too repetitive  short and snappy, nothing felt like filler content, i completed the game in just over 4 hours  all puzzles have logical solutions, unlike some other puzzle games where it feels like the only way to find the answer is pure luck potential cons  while most did not, a few puzzles involved timed stuff, which i am not too big a fan of. but these were rare, usually not that difficult and had closeby checkpoints to easily try again  i would not recommend this game to people who do not like heavy topics such as violence or mind control. this game is beautiful! but in a scary, bleak and occasionally sad way  far as i can tell you cannot pet the dogs  at the very start i had to go into the settings to see which button you had to press to interact with stuff, i personally did not mind this since it was only one single button i had to check one single time the controls are very simple but to all you tutorialenjoyers out there it could be a pet peeve at the start maybe it also showed me the button but i was too dumb to see it or something, this was just my experience conclusion i do not like platformers. i do not like puzzle games. this one changed my mind."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"i did not expect to love this game as much as i did. the controls are so simple, but the complexities and sheer variety of puzzles coupled with the intricate depthdefying level design of a 2d environment really made me feel compelled to see that happens next. it felt like a bad dream in a good way."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"best use of show, dont tell. you'll see why the game is called inside later, it's a short 2hour puzzle platformer with some really well thought of puzzles and mechanics, and it frequently drops on a 90 sale. even if not on sale, highly recommend everyone to experience this once in their life."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"an amazing game. it a couple notches above limbo and it really shows. a gripping story where you don't understand what's going on. as you go on, some pieces might make sense, but on the whole no explanation is provided. haven't finished it yet, right at the end, but if you're looking for a game that makes your brain work, this is it. interesting puzzles, amazing world building, eery atmosphere and a unique look are things that make this game a must have if you like brain storming in your games. fully recommended."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"fantastically dark, fun puzzles  great mechanics!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game is the perfect embodiment show don't tell. the atmosphere and world building are probably the best i've ever seen in a platformer. it builds the world without any dialogue, but with great visuals, intricate gameplaypuzzles, and an amazing soundtrack. there's also dozens of secrets that only further rewards players with a keen eye with extra story beats. definitely a must buy for anybody."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game very emotional content , dont like little nightmare .. this game very straight lane storyline you just move foward very easy to play .. the puzzle very realistic enviroment . you should play this game"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"i don't really have much to say about this game, positive or negative. the atmosphere and aesthetics are great and the creative team clearly put in a lot of effort to bring out the mysterious and creepy vibe that they were trying to. a for that. the puzzles were okay. nothing felt particularly challenging but i also wasn't bored while playing. if you're someone who prioritises game play over everything else in a game then maybe you'd be better off with a different puzzle game. overall, solid few hours of entertainment and i can understand why steam has this at a 96 positive reviews."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,very good looking game incredibly interesting storyline and great atmosphere!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,after almost 20 hours of playing this game i still havent completed it so there are definitely a lot of levels and puzzles. if you get this game on sale like i did just for 2 euros then its a w and underrated. but if you buy it at full price 20 euros then its still goated but kinda mid cuz of the price
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,"i never even knew about this game until my wife told me about it after she saw some people playing it on tiktok. it was one of those rare occasions where she was really interested in playing something, so i got it and found out it was by the same developers as limbo, which i had played in the past. i got the bundle and sat there watching her play while offering ideas on how to solve different puzzles. they weren't that hard, in my opinion. we completed it in under 8 hours, including achievements. it's a short, quick game that may seem challenging for some players who haven't developed the habit of backtracking or mapping out an entire zone before advancing, or timing out some of the puzzles the shockwave one was the trickiest at the end with the rotating thing, but it's enjoyable overall. i liked the fact that it quick saves after each puzzle, so you don't have to go through a lot of solved stuff again. storywise, well, you just have to piece most of it together in your mind and come up with your own theories. personally, i would've liked more chases like in the beginning since those are what sold the game to us in those tiktoks with people playing it. it's a really cool game, but i still think that limbo is far superiorcreepier, darker, and scarier."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,gameplay time is not as long as limbo but the graphics and the gameplay is way more interesting. the fact that the surrounding and the characters are more realistic makes the game more fun.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"fucking amazing game, great story"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,inside a must play game. its a puzzle adventure game just finished it and loved the whole journey!! the story goes like how a unknown factory runs test on humans and we the child stops it by completing multiple puzzles the puzzles are very good with a little twists. dont read any more reviews just go and play this!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,a game was really fun with a good graphic and a good story i loved
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"incredible game, the artwork, storyline and interactions are all well thought out and executed. refined, elegant and clean. thoroughly enjoyed this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"huge improvement over the developer's previous game, limbo. inside is creepy and a ton of fun. the dark and dismal world is bizarre and fascinating. the puzzles are intuitive but require some thought to work out. i enjoyed this game thoroughly, though i wasn't crazy about the anticlimactic ending."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,one of the greatest indie games of all times. inside tells a story which lets you decide what is going on. simple and effective graphics and gameplay. definitely worth a buy if you can catch this game and limbo on sale.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"very good game, just like limbo. would love for it to be longer, and for the devs to make more games"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"h1stellar sidescroller story tellingh1 what an interesting story and concept, i'd liken its mechanics and fidelity to little nightmares. very well put together, a masterpiece of art, with a story that will have you asking what's really going on, and with a splash of horror."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"its a really nice game. you are thrown into a world without any explanation, and that never change, because even now i am confused about what happened, what it was trying to say, or what the hell was going on. but that lack of explanation is actually charming after a while. i definitely recommend playing this game to anybody who is up for approx. 6 hours of total confusion and occasional laughter. personally i would rate this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"incredible how such a simple game can transmit so much fear, surprises and tension. also curiosity. i believe this is a masterpiece concept of a game. despite being 2.5d it is super entertaining and well worth going through it for both endings. recommended!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-25,"h1 1010 h1 sorry that i'm comparing it to little nightmares, has a similar wibe.. this game is super depressive and unsettling in an amazing way! the graphics are both simple and beautiful and unsettling, the sounds fit perfectly. i'm not 100 sure what is going on with the story but it's fine, it does not answer all my questions which is ok. littlenightmares was more scarry, it had more horror elements, it was more grotex. inside is more grounded, yet it is just as unsettling as lnm or maybe even a little more, which is nice. the puzzles are really creative and fun and require both thinking and timing but not in a irritating amount. there are many checkpoints, so i did not have to replay already done sections over and over again which is a great plus. i had many ahaaa and oh nooo and oh yeahhh moments. the first playthrough was 3 hours, maybe i will go for all the hidden stuff, otherwise there is not much replayability, same as at lnm. 100 recommended, especially for that nobrainer 12 usdeur current price which contains their other game as well which i did not play yet.. inside was more recommended and i can see why it was so well received"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"great game, love puzzles mixed in with a game that makes you ask questions about whats going on, if you like a mystery game with a good puzzle then this is for you"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"an excellent game of puzzle solving in a very atmospheric setting. very enjoyable, brilliant."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"a quite unique atmosphere, nice animation and fluid movement, entertaining and accessible puzzles. i am very happy to have had the opportunity to play this game. 100 recommend!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"beautiful. atmospheric, ominous, surprising, surreal. satisfying puzzle design that balances challenge with environmental hints."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"another terrific, sidescrolling platform game that told its dark and compelling story through constant movement and action. i finished it in 3.5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"absolutely amazing game. visually stunning. mechanics are wonderful and fluid. kept me asking questions and begging for answers that leave me with more mystery than when i went in. i'm so curious about the universe and what led to the events of this game. i love being given the freedom to figure it out myself or try and put together the lore in my own assumptions. wonderful journey we get to go on, i loved how interesting and challenging the puzzles were. great job! inside my playthrough httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v3jqyw5v2q5yt7176s"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-20,"such a neat little game. a perfect game for those interested in atmospheric horror, puzzles, and stories that leave you scratching your head. i wish i could forget it so that i could experience it all over again."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"amusing to play but too easy especially if you played limbo. i wish it was more challenging. however, unlike limbo, it is generally shocking in the way the kid dies by gunshots and torn by dogs and the alternative reality. it gives lots of moments of what just happened?."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"what a fantastic game. the art style is definitely simplistic, but the amount of detail and effort gone into it all  the backgrounds, the lighting, etc.  a good bit of which you may never see, is stunning. i started off considering it a lot alike unravelunravel 2, but without even having a unique gameplay mechanic like that does, but it constantly improved upon itself and really blew me away. the balance between the challenge and a consistent pace of progression was really impressive, and only rarely annoying if figuring something out meant trips back and forth between spots. there are also really neat mechanics, which don't really stop being introduced even until the very end, but never confuse or overwhelm. inside's atmosphere is also utterly striking. as i touched on, i was skeptical early on, but at some point my cynicism faded away without my noticing and i was just totally immersed in the moment. the sound design is amazing and the nature of this absurd world is really easy to be intrigued by. along with that, there's a brilliant story, all told without any dialogue. i'm a huge fan of television and movies and have an absurd amount to watch in each of those mediums, so when i play a video game i'm never looking for a movie that i have to pay money to sit at my computer and press buttons at, i want something utilising this medium in specific. luckily, inside does this incredibly. as i already mentioned, all of the gameplay is very engaging, but the game in terms of visual storytelling utilises the video game medium and makes something that would undeniably be inferior as something else. spoilerrealising that the character you played as was only a vessel for the story, to be thrown away as an amalgamation of other people, just as people are dispensable in the corporate world we live in that this game depicts, is enough to make your heart sink. people are born as a product here, a child who makes it out has slipped through the cracks of this cold system, and once his path, unstoppable by your input, turns him into a monster, the masses turn on him while the individuals help him. he is cast out completely as a monster, but there is a sunny spot left for him where he may stay as long as he pleases. spoiler there's so much to reflect on in this game, but feeling it in the moment was incredible. loved this. 810"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"inside got me thinking a lot when i finished playing it the first time. i really enjoy dystopian games, movies, shows, books. great design and game play. the art style is spot on with the ambiance of the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"for a game that at first glance may seem like a walking simulator, it's genuinely still decent as a game, and as a silent story. wish the game was longer due to its linear gameplay for reference, i was able to complete the main story  collectable aside  in three hours wo a guide, and at 20 without a sale, it's a questionable pricing by modern standards. but as it goes frequently on sale for 1.99 usd  you should be able to pick up the game for pretty cheap eventually. while it may not per say be the most visually impressive game of all time, for a 2016 indie title, you have to give credit for how nice the game looks  in particular the underwater bubbling is pretty neat. beyond that, i don't have much to say in regards to it without going into spoilers, but as someone who doesn't typically find reaction to games  and even though i find traditional jumpscare horror to be ineffective once you get used to it  i do believe the game has its moments where you will feel dread and some disgust in moments. in short  if the game interests you, i highly recommend picking up on sale, rather than full price  due to its short runtime. but once you do find that opportunity, i think it'll keep you company once playing the first time around."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"its a game where when you finish you are going to be like what have i just played, knowing its a masterpiece."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"a beautiful, bleak, cinematic nightmare fuel. puzzles are challenging enough to be fun. the detailed physics of the game amazed me, especially the blob's. so many beautiful but uncomfortable situations, i ran through the game with so many questions in mind."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,"dark and freaky game game voice acting and simple details make it more attractive , short game but enjoyable experience"

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"is freedom real, or is it just another illusion created by the very systems we seek to escape? these are the questions that inside left me with. at first glance, inside is a dark, eerie puzzleplatformer, but as i played, i realized it wasnt just about survival. the game explores society, control, and the unsettling truth that even rebellion can be manipulated. control, society, and the power structures at play one of the games core mechanics is the ability to control other people using a headsetlike device. some individuals are reduced to mindless puppets, obeying orders without resistance. others are imprisoned  caged but left alive, as if they serve no purpose beyond being contained. to me, this is a direct reflection of how society functions. capitalism, politics, and power structures are designed to control and use people. some are turned into obedient workers, while others, deemed useless, are simply locked away and ignored. the game doesnt show an active oppressor  it presents a system that maintains itself, where control is the default state. why a boy? the rebellious nature of youth the choice of protagonist  a young boy  stood out to me. unlike the controlled and imprisoned adults, the boy is vulnerable  every mistake results in death. this reflects how only at a young age do we question the system and try to break free. when you are young, you ask, why is society like this? how can i escape it? as you grow older, you either conform or exhaust yourself trying. the boy represents that phase of life where rebellion feels possible. but inside punishes every misstep harshly  just as society does to those who refuse to conform. the huddle a trap for revolutionaries eventually, the boy reaches the huddle, a grotesque mass of bodies. some players see this as a horrifying fate, but i see something more the huddle is made up of those who tried to break free before him. they werent destroyed  they were absorbed. maybe they were once rebels, just like the boy. maybe they tried to resist and were captured, studied, and turned into something controllable. even in its united form, the huddle remains connected to machines, still under control. this is one of the games most unsettling messages even revolution can be manipulated. even the strongest rebellion can be contained. does freedom even exist? at the end of the game, the huddle escapes  or so it seems. after crashing through barriers, it finally reaches a peaceful, sunlit area. and then nothing. the game just stops. no resolution, no victory. just silence. was this freedom? or a designed endpoint where the system knew it would end up all along? to me, this is insides final, haunting message if everything is built inside, then outside has no meaning. the boy believes he can find true freedom outside, but what if there is no outside? the world is structured to contain every possibility  including escape. if there is no true out"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"this game teaches you its mechanics by killing you until you get it. the ingame tutorial is almost nonexistent. would be a neutral review, but tends more towards positive."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-20,"inside is bleak, something to think about, unfortunately the world remains frustratingly elusive. hints and subtexts are found throughout, but there are no clear answers, i would have liked to know a little more. very reminiscent of the puzzles from aperture science from portal, only without humor and with much more existential horror. in some places funny references, it's a pity that the crowbar and freeman is not ours, apparently he did get to the water. who are those silent figures in the background? what is the true purpose of the mind control experiments? and most importantly, why doesit allseem so, uh. familiar? at times i expected to stumble upon a rusty crowbar, a relic of a scientist who finally made it to the water. but no, there's no escape or resistance here  just the quiet terror of submission."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"haunting, fun, and stays with you inside is one of those games that sucks you in right from the start and doesnt let go. theres no handholding, no dialoguejust you, a boy, and a world that feels unsettling in all the right ways. the gameplay is smooth, with clever puzzles and platforming that never feel frustrating, but what really makes this game special is the atmosphere. its eerie, mysterious, and full of moments that make you stop and wonder what the hell is actually going on. and the best part? everyone walks away with a different interpretation of the story. is it about control? free will? a dystopian nightmare? something even stranger? inside never gives you clear answers, and thats what makes it so brilliant. if you love games that are fun but also make you think and maybe even haunt you a little after youre done, this is a mustplay."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,silent storytelling masterpiece. this is gonna get tucked away in my single brain cell forever.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-04,a short but incredibly well done cinematic puzzle platformer.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"save ur money, boring repetitive overrated game, not even worth on sale"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-17,"managed to pick this up for less than two quid! on sale, this is a nobrainer. it's a fun, shortish horizonalish puzzler with updownleftrightgrab and that's it. nice game. no narrationcommentary, so you're working your way through the possible scenario as you go in your head. and it's dark. very dark! states it steam deck verified, but i wish you the best of luck finding some of the tiny little things you're supposed to spot to solve some of the puzzles. to be honest, there are are a few times where i've sold a section and thought yeah, that wasn't straightforward. but overall, brilliant. you should pick this up on sale and enjoy yourself !"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-16,"yet another fun and engaging puzzle platformer by playdead. worth a play, get that brain working."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-09,inside is a short game about some interesting horror concepts. it is very atmospheric with simple but fun gameplay.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-09,"very enjoyable game. nice graphics, interesting levels and fascinating storyline, i recommend!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,i had a lot of fun! the puzzles were varied and welldesigned. some felt a bit unfair at timesat least until i checked the solutions then i just felt not the smartest. the mystical and eerie atmosphere added perfectly to the experience.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"i completed after 3 days aof playing here and there for an hour at a time, i saw a post on 9gag showing the 3 doggo's near the fence and thought i'd try it, and oh my days!!! this game is something else, just wow!!, well done devs, and steam for making it cheap enough to buy, i have downloaded the limboinside pack and im still even after completing it wanting to play it again and complete the hidden parts, totally recommended and thank you to the person who posted it on 9gag."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"i thought inside was just going to be an edgy platformer little did i know that it would be a superb blend of lighting, sound design, and ambience that couples with an intriguing setting that doesn't hold your hand to tell you what's going on. i love how inside just scatters information and leaves the player put together the pieces."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,this game is better than it looks on the screenshots and the ambiance is amazing. turn the volume up! clever puzzles. if yo liked little nightmares you are probably gonna like this one. the the visual choice grows on you!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"an intriguing little puzzle game with some dark tones. fun quick puzzles compelling short adventure definitely keeps ya guessing, you just have to be along for the ride."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-22,"super game, best thing are bpuzzles and sound designb. i'm sad that i got this game for free.."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"yes. just play the game! it's usually a one and done deal but this game is so good i played it 3 times!! this game is well made and vague enough to let you infer what you need to about it. this game is a great game to get into gaming and a game all people should play to have it under their belt! h3 pros h3 list it's a great puzzle game, hard enough to make you think, but not to hard where you'd need extra help to figure it out the art style is creative and unique the storyworld is captivating and interesting it's like 20 last time i checked so that's a pretty good price for a mind bending game list h3 cons h3 list the story can be quite hard to follow at time, you can feel lost or not know whats happening getting the secret ending definitely requires some help list that's literally all the cons. if you don't have the game already, get it. you won't regret it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,a very good game. i highly recommend this if you like atmospheric horrorpsycho horror together with riddles

Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-20,"inside is a masterfully crafted puzzleplatformer that showcases the brilliance of playdead, the developers behind the iconic limbo. building on their signature style, inside offers a dark, atmospheric journey that is equal parts haunting and captivating. the game's minimalist approach to storytelling draws players into its mysterious world, leaving much to interpretation. the visuals are stunning, with a striking use of light, shadow, and sound that amplifies the eerie tone. the puzzles are clever and seamlessly integrated into the environment, ensuring the gameplay remains engaging from start to finish. as a big fan of limbo, inside feels like an evolution of that same eerie charm, delivering a more refined experience with deeper emotional weight. it's an unforgettable journey that lingers with you long after the credits roll. highly recommended for fans of atmospheric and thoughtprovoking games."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-23,"it's so simple, but the execution is so well done, that those few hours i spent in the game were really cool. will always remember it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-01,"inside is a puzzleplatformer set in a bleak, dystopian world. we control an unnamed boy, navigating through the environment as we solve puzzles to carry on. deadly threats loom throughout and must be avoided in various ways. the story is open to interpretation, with no dialogue and only visual cues to guide us along. the game is artistically beautiful, replete with dark silhouette designs. this is a fairly short adventure but is a memorable, innovative experience."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-11,"inside is a fascinating game with a strange yet captivating story. its fun, but not something you can play for long stretches without feeling a bit drained. that said, after a while, youll find yourself wanting to jump back in during your free time. overall, its a unique and interesting experience!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-16,"inside is quite a particular game, from the creators of limbo. it follows a similar gameplay loop, and even the way the story is told or rather, not told is also along the same lines. however, where i found limbo to be somewhat frustrating, i found myself enjoying this game quite a whole lot, even if i still had my issues with it. our story begins with an unnamed boy in an unnamed forest, being chased around by an unnamed group. and, as it stands, the whole game is like that we get to see a lot of stuff happen, but we never get clear answers as to how this worlds works, only that it looks somewhat dystopian, and dare i say, decaying. usually, i don't enjoy vague stories such as this one, but inside had something in it that kept me going forward, wanting to, if not learn, at least see more of this world. i can't go into a lot more details about the story, as i feel doing so would spoil the experience, and this game is certainly an experience. as for the gameplay, i already mentioned it's simlar to limbo. in case you're unfamiliar, it's a thirdperson platformer with puzzles and a small touch of exploration. there's no combat perse, whenever there's enemies, or, as i'd prefer to call them in this case, hostile elements, your usual course of action is either avoiding them through stealth or outrunning them. other than that, you'll have to move boxes, pull switches, push objects... lots of puzzles sprinkled throughout the game. personally, i found this part of the game and the exploration itself to be the better part of it in regards to the presence of hostile elements, the dogs in particular, i found them somewhat annoying. sound design is quite minimal, but where the game makes use of sound, it makes an impact. musical cues, soundtracks that faintly play in the background, i think it's all excellently crafted. and the art style is fantastic as well. while the gameplay remains 2d, the game makes good use of 3d environments, and the level design is great. sure, you won't get to that platform far away in the background, but seeing it gives this game a huge sense of scale. all in all, a solid experience, with an eerie atmosphere bordering on horror. i definitely recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-22,"i was genuinely surprised by how dark this minimalist game could become. its storyrich narrative, paired with sidescrolling puzzle platforming, strikes the perfect balance of challenge and engagement. as they say, a good puzzle makes the solver think they will get it. a great puzzle makes them feel smart when they do."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-02,"good game, i liked it!  similar in style to limbo, but an improved experience for me."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-15,"i think this game was a good experience, but i'm not recommending it because the ending or, in my opinion, the lack of one was terrible and a detriment to the overall experience, and i feel the need to stress that with how many positive reviews there are. the game threw me right into the actionalmost literallyand i was pleasantly surprised by how well that worked. i hesitate to call the puzzles particularly challenging, but they weren't overly easy either. they were enjoyable. the hardest puzzles were the ones with platforming, but even those were solvable after many tries. however, while the game's minimalistic approach to story tellingbuilding was very engaging, the game'squite franklyweird and open ended ending very quickly nullified all my investment into this world and its...story? i'm not going to spoil what the ending is, but it was like if a dragon ate the heroine on the last episode of a scifi show, right before she could reveal what her ultimate goal for this journey was. leaving me with questions such as, so what was that entire journey for?, when did dragons come into play?, what was the point of this story?, and, most importantly, what the f?!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-16,"controversial. yes, in the end i checked the box for recommending the game, but there is a but that lies in the fact it's not my genre a 2.5d platform game and i realized it only started playing it. one of the reasons i don't mark it as i don't recommend this game is because i didn't expect anything from it from the beginning and when i was buying it i was aware the game could turn out to be not my favotire genre. another reason is that despite the platform, i was curious about the story. its ending reserves many questions which is not bad at all. if you're not sure about the game same as i wasn't sure about it for some time but want to discover a new type of games, i'd recommend to take a chance."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-05,"amazing environmental storytelling. the ending was clever and satisfying. however, this is in dire need of an editor because it is way too long for what it is. the beginning is excellent, as it sets up the mystery and puts you into the world, and nothing overstays its welcome as it shows you something new about every 30 seconds, which is about correct for a gameplaylight walking simulator where you're mostly just moving forwards. but towards the middle of the game, the world grows larger and larger making your progress slow down significantly. this would be fine, except not only did they just start reusing ideas, none of which were particularly difficult puzzles in the first place, more than a couple areas of the game particularly the mermaid part are just extremely tedious. would be a strong recommendation if it was about an hour shorterif you start to get bored, maybe just look up a playthrough on youtube."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-17,"quite possibly the best puzzle game i've ever played. the endings are a little melancholy for my taste but literally everything else is gold plated platinum. the strongest recommendation possible, particularly because i bought it at 1.69 gbp. literally the best value for money i've ever had for a game, because this would have been well worth it for the 15 quid normal price. buy this game, play it for 36 hours depending on if you want all the achievements, and be blown away."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"i recently had a few hours of free time and decided to give the game inside a try. what i experienced was nothing short of mesmerizing. from start to finish, the game gripped me with its eerie atmosphere, clever puzzles, and a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. the games length is one of its strong suitsits not so long that it overstays its welcome, nor too short to feel incomplete. every moment is packed with intrigue, making it an experience that never becomes boring or repetitive. the puzzles are another highlight. they strike a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility, demanding just enough thought to be engaging without ever becoming frustrating. beyond gameplay, inside excels in storytelling without words. the dark, mysterious world unfolds through its stunning visuals and subtle environmental storytelling. every frame is crafted with precision, drawing players into its hauntingly beautiful world. overall, inside is a mustplay for fans of atmospheric puzzleplatformers. its masterful design and immersive experience make it one of the most memorable indie games ive played. a solid 910 in my book."

Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-31,"absolutely loved playing this game. the 2.5d gameplay, along with the eerie visuals and music makes this an interesting experience. i would definitely recommend playing this if you want to try something light and casual but with a mindbendinghorror twist to it 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-29,one of best gameplays. interesting puzzles. nice graphics. especcialy recommend for long flights
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-28,"big fan, the visuals and ambient is good. the music and puzzles are also, of course, good. some of the puzzles might be a bit too hard but asides from that. the game has the good quality's limbo has."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-20,"this game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and intrigue, offering a truly unique experience that lingers long after the credits roll. the puzzles are just the right level of difficultynot too easy, not too hardand they feel incredibly interactive with the environment. its not just about solving puzzles you really have to observe your surroundings, think critically, and make use of the world around you to progress. the lore is another standout aspect. its mysterious and intentionally vague, leaving you to piece things together through your own observations and interpretations. the game doesnt spoonfeed you answers, and thats part of what makes it so engaging. its a world where you feel like a small part of a much larger, unsettling narrative, and figuring out whats going on is as much about perception as it is about puzzlesolving. atmospherewise, inside nails it. the dark, gloomy dystopian setting envelops you from start to finish. the background objects and events make the environment feel alive, and youre simply caught up in this eerie world while trying to escape it. the sound design and music perfectly complement the tone of the game, creating tension and dread without overplaying it. one particular highlight for me was the physics of the game. it adds to the immersion, making each moment feel more intense. the parts with the dog chasing you, especially, had me on edge. the dogs movements, sounds, and the overall physics made those sequences feel so realit really made my heart race. the game isnt overly long, but it doesnt need to be. it delivers a compact but thoroughly thrilling experience, and the mystery of the dystopian world stays with you long after you finish. if you enjoy atmospheric puzzle games with a touch of dark, psychological storytelling, inside is definitely worth playing."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"the visual look so gorgeous. the puzzle are really interesting. its not really hard, but sometimes you need to think for a few minute to find the solution. the story are great, even though i don't fully understand the meaning behind it. hot takes, this game is much better than limbo. recommended. 910"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"inside is a dark, atmospheric puzzle game where you control a young boy in a strange, dangerous world. the game tells its story without words, using visuals and the environment to keep you guessing. the puzzles are challenging, and the eerie music and setting make the experience very intense. the games simple controls and beautiful art style make it a unique and memorable adventure. its a great example of how storytelling and gameplay can work together in a game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"art is recognized in the details. inside is a game that speaks without words, yet tells a story more powerfully than many games filled with dialogue. every moment is meticulously crafted, with the narrative unfolding through the eerie environment, haunting sound design, fluid animation, and clever gameplay situations. there are no explanationsonly you, the world around you, and the unsettling feeling that something is terribly wrong. the physics in the game are near perfect, making every movement feel weighty and real. the way the hero stumbles, climbs, or pushes objects adds to the immersion, making you feel his fragility in this cold and oppressive world. the gameplay, though minimalist, is masterfully designed. the puzzles blend seamlessly into the environment, never feeling out of place. the sound design is simply phenomenal. theres no background music in the traditional sensejust the ambient noises of distant machinery, echoing footsteps, and moments of eerie silence that make your heart race. the atmosphere constantly shifts between tension and curiosity, keeping you on edge while pulling you deeper into its mystery. and then theres the ending. it doesnt just surpriseit shocks, unsettles, and leaves you with more questions than answers. even after the credits roll, youll find yourself staring at the screen, trying to process what you just experienced. inside is not just a gameits a masterpiece of atmosphere, storytelling, and design. it lingers in your mind long after you put it down, and thats what makes it truly unforgettable."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,the game combines horror with strategy. it's very short but definitely worth the 1.99.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"inside is a short indie game with solid puzzle solving elements, and a story that will keep you curious. inside's story is told entirely through its visuals, with no human dialogue to speak of. its dull, watercolouresque visuals paints a clear picture of the dull reality in which the boy must survive. the story, however simple, is told very competently through these visuals, invoking feeling of unease and curiosity. additionally, the game offers collectables in the form of futuristiclooking orbs that you can dismantle. an alternative ending is present if they are all dismantled, providing some closure to the boy's story. despite it's 2 hour run time, perhaps 3 if you're going for all the collectables, inside provides an experience i am pleased to recommend."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"how the heck did they come up with this idea  it's incredible. although the game is short, it's evident the developers put a lot of work into this. short but sweet, as they say. i'm very picky with games  at one time i went without playing for years and years as i just got disinterested in all the various games that came out. this one is the first game i've played in a very long time, where i can't stop playing. it reminds me of dark souls that same kind of addiction 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"i played it blind, and the ending really amazed me! the puzzles and general visual and sound design were all great, in my opinion. really liked playing it, though after replaying a couple times, after finding all items, i stopped. it's totally worth the experience on a sale, i think, although at full price it's probably not worth it. it's only a couple hours of gameplay i think, and it's very linear. extremely superb atmospheric storytelling and story pacing, regardless. controls were easy to get the hang of too!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"inside, a phenomenal dark puzzle game that explores themes of control and to break free from said control. the atmosphere is incredibly eerie, perfectly complementing the dystopian setting. the ending is intentionally vague leaving players with head scratching moments but if you pay attention to the to details and connect the pieces of the puzzle, a picture begins to form. although the plot still remains open to interpretation which is something i personally love in games, it invites speculation and discussion among players and fans. overall, i consider inside a true work of art and i highly recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"lovely game with that kind of psychologicalthriller vibe to it. it's obscure and intriguing atmosphere complemented with interesting puzzles result in a beautiful game full of little details. i really enjoyed the experience, it was short but totally worth it! would love to see more like this."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"i cannot highly recommend this game enough. the gameplay is smooth. the story, while silent, does a very good job at illustrating what's going on. the learning curve isn't too bad either. you have to replay it a couple times to get all the endings and figure out all the easter eggs, which is definitely worth it."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"this game did something not many games have done to me before disturb me. it has a certain dystopian atmosphere, and despite the ending being a good one, it still feels.. uneasy. the game does a great job at what it sets out to do, and i applaud it for being one of the most immersive puzzle platformers i've ever played."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"further improving on the limbo formula by a long shot, playdead's inside is a remarkable feat of cinematic gaming. the nuanced gameplay and intricate puzzles are engaging, and the superb sound design, amazing animations and lighting compositions really immerse you in the storyrich world of inside."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i was very enthusiastic about limbo, both in terms of the concept and the amazing design. i liked inside as a conceptual successor even more. the eerie atmosphere, the dark setting and the overall game design of inside are impressive, a true work of art. the already great concept of limbo has been coherently expanded and improved in many respects. the game is very straightforward, you are thrown directly into the story without any explanation, the story only gradually reveals itself, but in many aspects it remains vague and open to interpretation until the end. it was very exciting to explore the game world with all its deadly dangers. compared to limbo, i often found the challenging puzzles and tests of skill much less frustrating. they never stopped me from enjoying the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i absolutely love inside. i think it is a perfect 2d puzzle platformer. i have already beaten it on the switch, but i just had to get it on steam and replay it again. it is creepy, stressful, and captivating. the art direction, the sound design, and the animations are all masterfully done. i also really like the handheld movement on the camera. it makes the game feel very immersive and cinematic. it may be a short experience but inside is the perfect example of quality over quantity."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,great experience with many memorable moments. amazing atmosphere coupled with thoughtprovoking extravagant storytelling with unexpectedly satisfying gameplay.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"a masterpiece of atmosphere and puzzle platforming inside by playdead is nothing short of a masterpiece. if you're a fan of atmospheric puzzleplatformers, this game should be at the top of your list. the game is visually stunning, featuring a dark, moody world that is full of mystery and tension. every scene is crafted with incredible attention to detail, with an eerie atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. the gameplay is simple but effective. you control a young boy navigating through a dystopian world filled with peril. the puzzles are integrated seamlessly into the environment, making each section feel like an organic part of the story. while the puzzles themselves aren't overly complex, they require you to think critically about how to progress, and the solutions are always satisfying when you figure them out. the real strength of inside lies in its ability to tell a gripping story without a single word of dialogue. the narrative is delivered through the environment, actions, and subtle details, creating an emotional connection to the protagonist and a desire to uncover the truth behind the strange world youre exploring. every moment is filled with tension, and the atmosphere alone is enough to make you feel both curious and unnerved. the games sound design is equally impressive, with ambient noises and a minimalist soundtrack that perfectly complements the worldbuilding. the sound effects help immerse you in the experience, whether it's the distant hum of machinery or the unsettling sounds of the world around you. while the game is relatively short, it's packed with memorable moments and puzzles that stay with you long after you finish. the pacing is excellent, and the ending, though open to interpretation, will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. overall, inside is a brilliant and haunting experience. it's a game that excels in atmosphere, narrative, and puzzle design. if you enjoy games that evoke emotion and make you think, this one is a mustplay. rating 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i've played this twice now and somehow my second playthrough hit even harder, it's been a while so i can't fully remember but what an incredible experience even the second time around... genuinely so few games can hope to capture the incredible beauty of inside. it's simply stunning in every way, fully recommend. the sound design and lighting in particular are stellar and elevate this beyond anything else. 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-05,"every moment of the game is satisfying. the environmental storytelling is a masterpiece, and i love how the atmosphere captures simple details and makes them even more captivating. i keep coming back to play this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"this is a really interesting, fun and short game that makes you feel a lot of things. at first you begin the game right off the main menu screen seamlessly which was a really cool idea and like it a lot. you are seemingly a little boy in a really strange world but by the end there are a lot of theories what exactly is happening but you can read them yourself. this is an indie game everyone should play and own at some point if you haven't."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"overall highly recommend, even for people like me who usually do not enjoy puzzle games. pros  astonishingly simplistic graphics that make for beautiful, powerful scenery  fantastic sound design  smooth and dynamic animation  intriguing worldbuilding  an ending that changes the context of the entire game up until that point for me  perfectly balanced puzzle difficulty for people like me who are quickly frustrated by games like this, did not once have to get help from the internet to solve any of the puzzles and yet they were difficult enough to be a fun challenge and satisfying to figure out, getting stuck for no longer than 10 minutes at the most difficult puzzles  lots of room for interpretation and theories  simple controls  introductions of game mechanics are weaved subtly into the gameplay itself without any outright tutorial throwing too much information at you at once  genuinely suspenseful at times, in the kind of way that makes you hold your breath and press the buttons on the keyboard down way too hard even though you know it won't make you run faster  merciful, well thoughtout checkpoints which prevent you having to redo annoying sections of the map just to get back to a difficult part of a puzzle without dying  curiosity driving a need for exploration which is granted tenfold in this game  this game does not spell everything out for you and allows you to explore, interpret, experiment and be immersed  the gameplay and mechanics are built upon, evolved and spiced up at a satisfying pace to prevent gameplay becoming stale or too repetitive  short and snappy, nothing felt like filler content, i completed the game in just over 4 hours  all puzzles have logical solutions, unlike some other puzzle games where it feels like the only way to find the answer is pure luck potential cons  while most did not, a few puzzles involved timed stuff, which i am not too big a fan of. but these were rare, usually not that difficult and had closeby checkpoints to easily try again  i would not recommend this game to people who do not like heavy topics such as violence or mind control. this game is beautiful! but in a scary, bleak and occasionally sad way  far as i can tell you cannot pet the dogs  at the very start i had to go into the settings to see which button you had to press to interact with stuff, i personally did not mind this since it was only one single button i had to check one single time the controls are very simple but to all you tutorialenjoyers out there it could be a pet peeve at the start maybe it also showed me the button but i was too dumb to see it or something, this was just my experience conclusion i do not like platformers. i do not like puzzle games. this one changed my mind."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"i did not expect to love this game as much as i did. the controls are so simple, but the complexities and sheer variety of puzzles coupled with the intricate depthdefying level design of a 2d environment really made me feel compelled to see that happens next. it felt like a bad dream in a good way."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"best use of show, dont tell. you'll see why the game is called inside later, it's a short 2hour puzzle platformer with some really well thought of puzzles and mechanics, and it frequently drops on a 90 sale. even if not on sale, highly recommend everyone to experience this once in their life."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"an amazing game. it a couple notches above limbo and it really shows. a gripping story where you don't understand what's going on. as you go on, some pieces might make sense, but on the whole no explanation is provided. haven't finished it yet, right at the end, but if you're looking for a game that makes your brain work, this is it. interesting puzzles, amazing world building, eery atmosphere and a unique look are things that make this game a must have if you like brain storming in your games. fully recommended."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"fantastically dark, fun puzzles  great mechanics!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game is the perfect embodiment show don't tell. the atmosphere and world building are probably the best i've ever seen in a platformer. it builds the world without any dialogue, but with great visuals, intricate gameplaypuzzles, and an amazing soundtrack. there's also dozens of secrets that only further rewards players with a keen eye with extra story beats. definitely a must buy for anybody."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game very emotional content , dont like little nightmare .. this game very straight lane storyline you just move foward very easy to play .. the puzzle very realistic enviroment . you should play this game"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"i don't really have much to say about this game, positive or negative. the atmosphere and aesthetics are great and the creative team clearly put in a lot of effort to bring out the mysterious and creepy vibe that they were trying to. a for that. the puzzles were okay. nothing felt particularly challenging but i also wasn't bored while playing. if you're someone who prioritises game play over everything else in a game then maybe you'd be better off with a different puzzle game. overall, solid few hours of entertainment and i can understand why steam has this at a 96 positive reviews."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,very good looking game incredibly interesting storyline and great atmosphere!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,after almost 20 hours of playing this game i still havent completed it so there are definitely a lot of levels and puzzles. if you get this game on sale like i did just for 2 euros then its a w and underrated. but if you buy it at full price 20 euros then its still goated but kinda mid cuz of the price
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,"i never even knew about this game until my wife told me about it after she saw some people playing it on tiktok. it was one of those rare occasions where she was really interested in playing something, so i got it and found out it was by the same developers as limbo, which i had played in the past. i got the bundle and sat there watching her play while offering ideas on how to solve different puzzles. they weren't that hard, in my opinion. we completed it in under 8 hours, including achievements. it's a short, quick game that may seem challenging for some players who haven't developed the habit of backtracking or mapping out an entire zone before advancing, or timing out some of the puzzles the shockwave one was the trickiest at the end with the rotating thing, but it's enjoyable overall. i liked the fact that it quick saves after each puzzle, so you don't have to go through a lot of solved stuff again. storywise, well, you just have to piece most of it together in your mind and come up with your own theories. personally, i would've liked more chases like in the beginning since those are what sold the game to us in those tiktoks with people playing it. it's a really cool game, but i still think that limbo is far superiorcreepier, darker, and scarier."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,gameplay time is not as long as limbo but the graphics and the gameplay is way more interesting. the fact that the surrounding and the characters are more realistic makes the game more fun.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"fucking amazing game, great story"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,inside a must play game. its a puzzle adventure game just finished it and loved the whole journey!! the story goes like how a unknown factory runs test on humans and we the child stops it by completing multiple puzzles the puzzles are very good with a little twists. dont read any more reviews just go and play this!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,a game was really fun with a good graphic and a good story i loved
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"incredible game, the artwork, storyline and interactions are all well thought out and executed. refined, elegant and clean. thoroughly enjoyed this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"huge improvement over the developer's previous game, limbo. inside is creepy and a ton of fun. the dark and dismal world is bizarre and fascinating. the puzzles are intuitive but require some thought to work out. i enjoyed this game thoroughly, though i wasn't crazy about the anticlimactic ending."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,one of the greatest indie games of all times. inside tells a story which lets you decide what is going on. simple and effective graphics and gameplay. definitely worth a buy if you can catch this game and limbo on sale.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"very good game, just like limbo. would love for it to be longer, and for the devs to make more games"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"h1stellar sidescroller story tellingh1 what an interesting story and concept, i'd liken its mechanics and fidelity to little nightmares. very well put together, a masterpiece of art, with a story that will have you asking what's really going on, and with a splash of horror."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"its a really nice game. you are thrown into a world without any explanation, and that never change, because even now i am confused about what happened, what it was trying to say, or what the hell was going on. but that lack of explanation is actually charming after a while. i definitely recommend playing this game to anybody who is up for approx. 6 hours of total confusion and occasional laughter. personally i would rate this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"incredible how such a simple game can transmit so much fear, surprises and tension. also curiosity. i believe this is a masterpiece concept of a game. despite being 2.5d it is super entertaining and well worth going through it for both endings. recommended!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-25,"h1 1010 h1 sorry that i'm comparing it to little nightmares, has a similar wibe.. this game is super depressive and unsettling in an amazing way! the graphics are both simple and beautiful and unsettling, the sounds fit perfectly. i'm not 100 sure what is going on with the story but it's fine, it does not answer all my questions which is ok. littlenightmares was more scarry, it had more horror elements, it was more grotex. inside is more grounded, yet it is just as unsettling as lnm or maybe even a little more, which is nice. the puzzles are really creative and fun and require both thinking and timing but not in a irritating amount. there are many checkpoints, so i did not have to replay already done sections over and over again which is a great plus. i had many ahaaa and oh nooo and oh yeahhh moments. the first playthrough was 3 hours, maybe i will go for all the hidden stuff, otherwise there is not much replayability, same as at lnm. 100 recommended, especially for that nobrainer 12 usdeur current price which contains their other game as well which i did not play yet.. inside was more recommended and i can see why it was so well received"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"great game, love puzzles mixed in with a game that makes you ask questions about whats going on, if you like a mystery game with a good puzzle then this is for you"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"an excellent game of puzzle solving in a very atmospheric setting. very enjoyable, brilliant."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"a quite unique atmosphere, nice animation and fluid movement, entertaining and accessible puzzles. i am very happy to have had the opportunity to play this game. 100 recommend!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"beautiful. atmospheric, ominous, surprising, surreal. satisfying puzzle design that balances challenge with environmental hints."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"another terrific, sidescrolling platform game that told its dark and compelling story through constant movement and action. i finished it in 3.5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"absolutely amazing game. visually stunning. mechanics are wonderful and fluid. kept me asking questions and begging for answers that leave me with more mystery than when i went in. i'm so curious about the universe and what led to the events of this game. i love being given the freedom to figure it out myself or try and put together the lore in my own assumptions. wonderful journey we get to go on, i loved how interesting and challenging the puzzles were. great job! inside my playthrough httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v3jqyw5v2q5yt7176s"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-20,"such a neat little game. a perfect game for those interested in atmospheric horror, puzzles, and stories that leave you scratching your head. i wish i could forget it so that i could experience it all over again."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"amusing to play but too easy especially if you played limbo. i wish it was more challenging. however, unlike limbo, it is generally shocking in the way the kid dies by gunshots and torn by dogs and the alternative reality. it gives lots of moments of what just happened?."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"what a fantastic game. the art style is definitely simplistic, but the amount of detail and effort gone into it all  the backgrounds, the lighting, etc.  a good bit of which you may never see, is stunning. i started off considering it a lot alike unravelunravel 2, but without even having a unique gameplay mechanic like that does, but it constantly improved upon itself and really blew me away. the balance between the challenge and a consistent pace of progression was really impressive, and only rarely annoying if figuring something out meant trips back and forth between spots. there are also really neat mechanics, which don't really stop being introduced even until the very end, but never confuse or overwhelm. inside's atmosphere is also utterly striking. as i touched on, i was skeptical early on, but at some point my cynicism faded away without my noticing and i was just totally immersed in the moment. the sound design is amazing and the nature of this absurd world is really easy to be intrigued by. along with that, there's a brilliant story, all told without any dialogue. i'm a huge fan of television and movies and have an absurd amount to watch in each of those mediums, so when i play a video game i'm never looking for a movie that i have to pay money to sit at my computer and press buttons at, i want something utilising this medium in specific. luckily, inside does this incredibly. as i already mentioned, all of the gameplay is very engaging, but the game in terms of visual storytelling utilises the video game medium and makes something that would undeniably be inferior as something else. spoilerrealising that the character you played as was only a vessel for the story, to be thrown away as an amalgamation of other people, just as people are dispensable in the corporate world we live in that this game depicts, is enough to make your heart sink. people are born as a product here, a child who makes it out has slipped through the cracks of this cold system, and once his path, unstoppable by your input, turns him into a monster, the masses turn on him while the individuals help him. he is cast out completely as a monster, but there is a sunny spot left for him where he may stay as long as he pleases. spoiler there's so much to reflect on in this game, but feeling it in the moment was incredible. loved this. 810"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"inside got me thinking a lot when i finished playing it the first time. i really enjoy dystopian games, movies, shows, books. great design and game play. the art style is spot on with the ambiance of the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"for a game that at first glance may seem like a walking simulator, it's genuinely still decent as a game, and as a silent story. wish the game was longer due to its linear gameplay for reference, i was able to complete the main story  collectable aside  in three hours wo a guide, and at 20 without a sale, it's a questionable pricing by modern standards. but as it goes frequently on sale for 1.99 usd  you should be able to pick up the game for pretty cheap eventually. while it may not per say be the most visually impressive game of all time, for a 2016 indie title, you have to give credit for how nice the game looks  in particular the underwater bubbling is pretty neat. beyond that, i don't have much to say in regards to it without going into spoilers, but as someone who doesn't typically find reaction to games  and even though i find traditional jumpscare horror to be ineffective once you get used to it  i do believe the game has its moments where you will feel dread and some disgust in moments. in short  if the game interests you, i highly recommend picking up on sale, rather than full price  due to its short runtime. but once you do find that opportunity, i think it'll keep you company once playing the first time around."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"its a game where when you finish you are going to be like what have i just played, knowing its a masterpiece."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"a beautiful, bleak, cinematic nightmare fuel. puzzles are challenging enough to be fun. the detailed physics of the game amazed me, especially the blob's. so many beautiful but uncomfortable situations, i ran through the game with so many questions in mind."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"is freedom real, or is it just another illusion created by the very systems we seek to escape? these are the questions that inside left me with. at first glance, inside is a dark, eerie puzzleplatformer, but as i played, i realized it wasnt just about survival. the game explores society, control, and the unsettling truth that even rebellion can be manipulated. control, society, and the power structures at play one of the games core mechanics is the ability to control other people using a headsetlike device. some individuals are reduced to mindless puppets, obeying orders without resistance. others are imprisoned  caged but left alive, as if they serve no purpose beyond being contained. to me, this is a direct reflection of how society functions. capitalism, politics, and power structures are designed to control and use people. some are turned into obedient workers, while others, deemed useless, are simply locked away and ignored. the game doesnt show an active oppressor  it presents a system that maintains itself, where control is the default state. why a boy? the rebellious nature of youth the choice of protagonist  a young boy  stood out to me. unlike the controlled and imprisoned adults, the boy is vulnerable  every mistake results in death. this reflects how only at a young age do we question the system and try to break free. when you are young, you ask, why is society like this? how can i escape it? as you grow older, you either conform or exhaust yourself trying. the boy represents that phase of life where rebellion feels possible. but inside punishes every misstep harshly  just as society does to those who refuse to conform. the huddle a trap for revolutionaries eventually, the boy reaches the huddle, a grotesque mass of bodies. some players see this as a horrifying fate, but i see something more the huddle is made up of those who tried to break free before him. they werent destroyed  they were absorbed. maybe they were once rebels, just like the boy. maybe they tried to resist and were captured, studied, and turned into something controllable. even in its united form, the huddle remains connected to machines, still under control. this is one of the games most unsettling messages even revolution can be manipulated. even the strongest rebellion can be contained. does freedom even exist? at the end of the game, the huddle escapes  or so it seems. after crashing through barriers, it finally reaches a peaceful, sunlit area. and then nothing. the game just stops. no resolution, no victory. just silence. was this freedom? or a designed endpoint where the system knew it would end up all along? to me, this is insides final, haunting message if everything is built inside, then outside has no meaning. the boy believes he can find true freedom outside, but what if there is no outside? the world is structured to contain every possibility  including escape. if there is no true out"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"this game teaches you its mechanics by killing you until you get it. the ingame tutorial is almost nonexistent. would be a neutral review, but tends more towards positive."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-20,"inside is bleak, something to think about, unfortunately the world remains frustratingly elusive. hints and subtexts are found throughout, but there are no clear answers, i would have liked to know a little more. very reminiscent of the puzzles from aperture science from portal, only without humor and with much more existential horror. in some places funny references, it's a pity that the crowbar and freeman is not ours, apparently he did get to the water. who are those silent figures in the background? what is the true purpose of the mind control experiments? and most importantly, why doesit allseem so, uh. familiar? at times i expected to stumble upon a rusty crowbar, a relic of a scientist who finally made it to the water. but no, there's no escape or resistance here  just the quiet terror of submission."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"haunting, fun, and stays with you inside is one of those games that sucks you in right from the start and doesnt let go. theres no handholding, no dialoguejust you, a boy, and a world that feels unsettling in all the right ways. the gameplay is smooth, with clever puzzles and platforming that never feel frustrating, but what really makes this game special is the atmosphere. its eerie, mysterious, and full of moments that make you stop and wonder what the hell is actually going on. and the best part? everyone walks away with a different interpretation of the story. is it about control? free will? a dystopian nightmare? something even stranger? inside never gives you clear answers, and thats what makes it so brilliant. if you love games that are fun but also make you think and maybe even haunt you a little after youre done, this is a mustplay."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,silent storytelling masterpiece. this is gonna get tucked away in my single brain cell forever.

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"i completed after 3 days aof playing here and there for an hour at a time, i saw a post on 9gag showing the 3 doggo's near the fence and thought i'd try it, and oh my days!!! this game is something else, just wow!!, well done devs, and steam for making it cheap enough to buy, i have downloaded the limboinside pack and im still even after completing it wanting to play it again and complete the hidden parts, totally recommended and thank you to the person who posted it on 9gag."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"i thought inside was just going to be an edgy platformer little did i know that it would be a superb blend of lighting, sound design, and ambience that couples with an intriguing setting that doesn't hold your hand to tell you what's going on. i love how inside just scatters information and leaves the player put together the pieces."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"yes. just play the game! it's usually a one and done deal but this game is so good i played it 3 times!! this game is well made and vague enough to let you infer what you need to about it. this game is a great game to get into gaming and a game all people should play to have it under their belt! h3 pros h3 list it's a great puzzle game, hard enough to make you think, but not to hard where you'd need extra help to figure it out the art style is creative and unique the storyworld is captivating and interesting it's like 20 last time i checked so that's a pretty good price for a mind bending game list h3 cons h3 list the story can be quite hard to follow at time, you can feel lost or not know whats happening getting the secret ending definitely requires some help list that's literally all the cons. if you don't have the game already, get it. you won't regret it."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-20,"inside is a masterfully crafted puzzleplatformer that showcases the brilliance of playdead, the developers behind the iconic limbo. building on their signature style, inside offers a dark, atmospheric journey that is equal parts haunting and captivating. the game's minimalist approach to storytelling draws players into its mysterious world, leaving much to interpretation. the visuals are stunning, with a striking use of light, shadow, and sound that amplifies the eerie tone. the puzzles are clever and seamlessly integrated into the environment, ensuring the gameplay remains engaging from start to finish. as a big fan of limbo, inside feels like an evolution of that same eerie charm, delivering a more refined experience with deeper emotional weight. it's an unforgettable journey that lingers with you long after the credits roll. highly recommended for fans of atmospheric and thoughtprovoking games."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-23,"it's so simple, but the execution is so well done, that those few hours i spent in the game were really cool. will always remember it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-01,"inside is a puzzleplatformer set in a bleak, dystopian world. we control an unnamed boy, navigating through the environment as we solve puzzles to carry on. deadly threats loom throughout and must be avoided in various ways. the story is open to interpretation, with no dialogue and only visual cues to guide us along. the game is artistically beautiful, replete with dark silhouette designs. this is a fairly short adventure but is a memorable, innovative experience."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-11,"inside is a fascinating game with a strange yet captivating story. its fun, but not something you can play for long stretches without feeling a bit drained. that said, after a while, youll find yourself wanting to jump back in during your free time. overall, its a unique and interesting experience!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-16,"inside is quite a particular game, from the creators of limbo. it follows a similar gameplay loop, and even the way the story is told or rather, not told is also along the same lines. however, where i found limbo to be somewhat frustrating, i found myself enjoying this game quite a whole lot, even if i still had my issues with it. our story begins with an unnamed boy in an unnamed forest, being chased around by an unnamed group. and, as it stands, the whole game is like that we get to see a lot of stuff happen, but we never get clear answers as to how this worlds works, only that it looks somewhat dystopian, and dare i say, decaying. usually, i don't enjoy vague stories such as this one, but inside had something in it that kept me going forward, wanting to, if not learn, at least see more of this world. i can't go into a lot more details about the story, as i feel doing so would spoil the experience, and this game is certainly an experience. as for the gameplay, i already mentioned it's simlar to limbo. in case you're unfamiliar, it's a thirdperson platformer with puzzles and a small touch of exploration. there's no combat perse, whenever there's enemies, or, as i'd prefer to call them in this case, hostile elements, your usual course of action is either avoiding them through stealth or outrunning them. other than that, you'll have to move boxes, pull switches, push objects... lots of puzzles sprinkled throughout the game. personally, i found this part of the game and the exploration itself to be the better part of it in regards to the presence of hostile elements, the dogs in particular, i found them somewhat annoying. sound design is quite minimal, but where the game makes use of sound, it makes an impact. musical cues, soundtracks that faintly play in the background, i think it's all excellently crafted. and the art style is fantastic as well. while the gameplay remains 2d, the game makes good use of 3d environments, and the level design is great. sure, you won't get to that platform far away in the background, but seeing it gives this game a huge sense of scale. all in all, a solid experience, with an eerie atmosphere bordering on horror. i definitely recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-22,"i was genuinely surprised by how dark this minimalist game could become. its storyrich narrative, paired with sidescrolling puzzle platforming, strikes the perfect balance of challenge and engagement. as they say, a good puzzle makes the solver think they will get it. a great puzzle makes them feel smart when they do."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-02,"good game, i liked it!  similar in style to limbo, but an improved experience for me."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-15,"i think this game was a good experience, but i'm not recommending it because the ending or, in my opinion, the lack of one was terrible and a detriment to the overall experience, and i feel the need to stress that with how many positive reviews there are. the game threw me right into the actionalmost literallyand i was pleasantly surprised by how well that worked. i hesitate to call the puzzles particularly challenging, but they weren't overly easy either. they were enjoyable. the hardest puzzles were the ones with platforming, but even those were solvable after many tries. however, while the game's minimalistic approach to story tellingbuilding was very engaging, the game'squite franklyweird and open ended ending very quickly nullified all my investment into this world and its...story? i'm not going to spoil what the ending is, but it was like if a dragon ate the heroine on the last episode of a scifi show, right before she could reveal what her ultimate goal for this journey was. leaving me with questions such as, so what was that entire journey for?, when did dragons come into play?, what was the point of this story?, and, most importantly, what the f?!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-16,"controversial. yes, in the end i checked the box for recommending the game, but there is a but that lies in the fact it's not my genre a 2.5d platform game and i realized it only started playing it. one of the reasons i don't mark it as i don't recommend this game is because i didn't expect anything from it from the beginning and when i was buying it i was aware the game could turn out to be not my favotire genre. another reason is that despite the platform, i was curious about the story. its ending reserves many questions which is not bad at all. if you're not sure about the game same as i wasn't sure about it for some time but want to discover a new type of games, i'd recommend to take a chance."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-05,"amazing environmental storytelling. the ending was clever and satisfying. however, this is in dire need of an editor because it is way too long for what it is. the beginning is excellent, as it sets up the mystery and puts you into the world, and nothing overstays its welcome as it shows you something new about every 30 seconds, which is about correct for a gameplaylight walking simulator where you're mostly just moving forwards. but towards the middle of the game, the world grows larger and larger making your progress slow down significantly. this would be fine, except not only did they just start reusing ideas, none of which were particularly difficult puzzles in the first place, more than a couple areas of the game particularly the mermaid part are just extremely tedious. would be a strong recommendation if it was about an hour shorterif you start to get bored, maybe just look up a playthrough on youtube."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-17,"quite possibly the best puzzle game i've ever played. the endings are a little melancholy for my taste but literally everything else is gold plated platinum. the strongest recommendation possible, particularly because i bought it at 1.69 gbp. literally the best value for money i've ever had for a game, because this would have been well worth it for the 15 quid normal price. buy this game, play it for 36 hours depending on if you want all the achievements, and be blown away."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"i recently had a few hours of free time and decided to give the game inside a try. what i experienced was nothing short of mesmerizing. from start to finish, the game gripped me with its eerie atmosphere, clever puzzles, and a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. the games length is one of its strong suitsits not so long that it overstays its welcome, nor too short to feel incomplete. every moment is packed with intrigue, making it an experience that never becomes boring or repetitive. the puzzles are another highlight. they strike a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility, demanding just enough thought to be engaging without ever becoming frustrating. beyond gameplay, inside excels in storytelling without words. the dark, mysterious world unfolds through its stunning visuals and subtle environmental storytelling. every frame is crafted with precision, drawing players into its hauntingly beautiful world. overall, inside is a mustplay for fans of atmospheric puzzleplatformers. its masterful design and immersive experience make it one of the most memorable indie games ive played. a solid 910 in my book."

Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-31,"absolutely loved playing this game. the 2.5d gameplay, along with the eerie visuals and music makes this an interesting experience. i would definitely recommend playing this if you want to try something light and casual but with a mindbendinghorror twist to it 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-29,one of best gameplays. interesting puzzles. nice graphics. especcialy recommend for long flights
Puzzle,Inside,2024-12-28,"big fan, the visuals and ambient is good. the music and puzzles are also, of course, good. some of the puzzles might be a bit too hard but asides from that. the game has the good quality's limbo has."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-01-20,"this game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and intrigue, offering a truly unique experience that lingers long after the credits roll. the puzzles are just the right level of difficultynot too easy, not too hardand they feel incredibly interactive with the environment. its not just about solving puzzles you really have to observe your surroundings, think critically, and make use of the world around you to progress. the lore is another standout aspect. its mysterious and intentionally vague, leaving you to piece things together through your own observations and interpretations. the game doesnt spoonfeed you answers, and thats part of what makes it so engaging. its a world where you feel like a small part of a much larger, unsettling narrative, and figuring out whats going on is as much about perception as it is about puzzlesolving. atmospherewise, inside nails it. the dark, gloomy dystopian setting envelops you from start to finish. the background objects and events make the environment feel alive, and youre simply caught up in this eerie world while trying to escape it. the sound design and music perfectly complement the tone of the game, creating tension and dread without overplaying it. one particular highlight for me was the physics of the game. it adds to the immersion, making each moment feel more intense. the parts with the dog chasing you, especially, had me on edge. the dogs movements, sounds, and the overall physics made those sequences feel so realit really made my heart race. the game isnt overly long, but it doesnt need to be. it delivers a compact but thoroughly thrilling experience, and the mystery of the dystopian world stays with you long after you finish. if you enjoy atmospheric puzzle games with a touch of dark, psychological storytelling, inside is definitely worth playing."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"the visual look so gorgeous. the puzzle are really interesting. its not really hard, but sometimes you need to think for a few minute to find the solution. the story are great, even though i don't fully understand the meaning behind it. hot takes, this game is much better than limbo. recommended. 910"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"inside is a dark, atmospheric puzzle game where you control a young boy in a strange, dangerous world. the game tells its story without words, using visuals and the environment to keep you guessing. the puzzles are challenging, and the eerie music and setting make the experience very intense. the games simple controls and beautiful art style make it a unique and memorable adventure. its a great example of how storytelling and gameplay can work together in a game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"art is recognized in the details. inside is a game that speaks without words, yet tells a story more powerfully than many games filled with dialogue. every moment is meticulously crafted, with the narrative unfolding through the eerie environment, haunting sound design, fluid animation, and clever gameplay situations. there are no explanationsonly you, the world around you, and the unsettling feeling that something is terribly wrong. the physics in the game are near perfect, making every movement feel weighty and real. the way the hero stumbles, climbs, or pushes objects adds to the immersion, making you feel his fragility in this cold and oppressive world. the gameplay, though minimalist, is masterfully designed. the puzzles blend seamlessly into the environment, never feeling out of place. the sound design is simply phenomenal. theres no background music in the traditional sensejust the ambient noises of distant machinery, echoing footsteps, and moments of eerie silence that make your heart race. the atmosphere constantly shifts between tension and curiosity, keeping you on edge while pulling you deeper into its mystery. and then theres the ending. it doesnt just surpriseit shocks, unsettles, and leaves you with more questions than answers. even after the credits roll, youll find yourself staring at the screen, trying to process what you just experienced. inside is not just a gameits a masterpiece of atmosphere, storytelling, and design. it lingers in your mind long after you put it down, and thats what makes it truly unforgettable."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,the game combines horror with strategy. it's very short but definitely worth the 1.99.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"inside is a short indie game with solid puzzle solving elements, and a story that will keep you curious. inside's story is told entirely through its visuals, with no human dialogue to speak of. its dull, watercolouresque visuals paints a clear picture of the dull reality in which the boy must survive. the story, however simple, is told very competently through these visuals, invoking feeling of unease and curiosity. additionally, the game offers collectables in the form of futuristiclooking orbs that you can dismantle. an alternative ending is present if they are all dismantled, providing some closure to the boy's story. despite it's 2 hour run time, perhaps 3 if you're going for all the collectables, inside provides an experience i am pleased to recommend."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-17,"i didn't know what to expect when picking this game up but it exceeded all my expectations. from the well thought out story to the beautiful design of the landscape, not to mention the mechanics which make you think outside the box when solving the different puzzles. i absolutely loved this game. what a masterpiece!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-17,"okay so really good game was able to get all achievements they took a bit of time to find but not much of a hassle, i was actually really pulled into this game, i loved the story it had behind it had suspense and you get that feeling of always wanting to know what's next. can't really say anything else apart from try this game you won't regret it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-16,the game is engaging with great graphic and excellent sound design. i request the team to bring more of this with different creepy creatures and with more playtime.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"wow, what a beautiful game. audio and visuals were top tier. idk why i waited so long to play, and idk how the ending wasn't ruined for me. stop reading reviews and just go play it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,extremely good game. super cool story and graphic style!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"how the heck did they come up with this idea  it's incredible. although the game is short, it's evident the developers put a lot of work into this. short but sweet, as they say. i'm very picky with games  at one time i went without playing for years and years as i just got disinterested in all the various games that came out. this one is the first game i've played in a very long time, where i can't stop playing. it reminds me of dark souls that same kind of addiction 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,"i played it blind, and the ending really amazed me! the puzzles and general visual and sound design were all great, in my opinion. really liked playing it, though after replaying a couple times, after finding all items, i stopped. it's totally worth the experience on a sale, i think, although at full price it's probably not worth it. it's only a couple hours of gameplay i think, and it's very linear. extremely superb atmospheric storytelling and story pacing, regardless. controls were easy to get the hang of too!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"inside, a phenomenal dark puzzle game that explores themes of control and to break free from said control. the atmosphere is incredibly eerie, perfectly complementing the dystopian setting. the ending is intentionally vague leaving players with head scratching moments but if you pay attention to the to details and connect the pieces of the puzzle, a picture begins to form. although the plot still remains open to interpretation which is something i personally love in games, it invites speculation and discussion among players and fans. overall, i consider inside a true work of art and i highly recommend it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-14,"lovely game with that kind of psychologicalthriller vibe to it. it's obscure and intriguing atmosphere complemented with interesting puzzles result in a beautiful game full of little details. i really enjoyed the experience, it was short but totally worth it! would love to see more like this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"another amazing game by playdead. i like this even more than limbo, such a unique experience. i love how you always feel like you're being watchedchased. one of the best puzzle platformers i've played."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"i cannot highly recommend this game enough. the gameplay is smooth. the story, while silent, does a very good job at illustrating what's going on. the learning curve isn't too bad either. you have to replay it a couple times to get all the endings and figure out all the easter eggs, which is definitely worth it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"this game is definitely giving george orwells 1984 vibes and i love it. it's eery, it's uncomfortable, it's stressful  in such a good way. wowowowow!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"recommended it when played it then, i recommend it today as well, it holds up fantastically"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,this game prove that you don't need any dialogues or any cutscences to tell an amazing story
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"great dark atmosphere, captivating music that fits the world and the game perfectly. gameplay is simple yet efficient and provides a very enjoyable experience. puzzles present enough challenge and remain engaging and fresh throughout the game as they do not repeat, and all of them have some uniqueness and cleverness to them. this all comes together in a deeply dark and orwellian world that left me wanting more. i had an amazing experience myself with this game. it is a must buy and a must play."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-13,"this game did something not many games have done to me before disturb me. it has a certain dystopian atmosphere, and despite the ending being a good one, it still feels.. uneasy. the game does a great job at what it sets out to do, and i applaud it for being one of the most immersive puzzle platformers i've ever played."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"further improving on the limbo formula by a long shot, playdead's inside is a remarkable feat of cinematic gaming. the nuanced gameplay and intricate puzzles are engaging, and the superb sound design, amazing animations and lighting compositions really immerse you in the storyrich world of inside."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"this game is amazing. 1010 the animations, the graphics, the sounds, the scenery, .... a must play"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"quite an immersive, engaging, interesting, creative and philosophical game, to be honest. i really, really enjoyed playing this game all the way twice. the first time i played it like usual and the second was to collect all those collectibles to get all the achievements, which i did. highly recommended for gamers and other people to try it out and voice their respective opinions. thanks."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-10,"like playdead's other game limbo, inside is filled with a lot of really cool puzzles and situations. but it's even better. definitely one of the best puzzle platformers i've ever played. i'd love to see more games from this developer, they seem to excel at this genre."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-10,"this game is a masterpiece. its haunting atmosphere, smooth gameplay, and subtle storytelling creates an unforgettable experience that stays with you long after you finish it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-09,"this game is a really cool experience, it's not very long but it left me speechless, the ambiance either visual or audio is really well done, the animations are awesome, i've rarely seen such good animations in a game, and the gameplay is really fun and make you think multiple times of how to do something, in short it's a good game that's really cool to play. and if you also like dark universes like limbo, little nightmares, or games that have a similar feeling, you will definitively like inside a lot."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-08,"the whole story line is superb. the controls and the gameplay. amazing. it sounds like horror but not horror, just keeping u edge away. must play."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i was very enthusiastic about limbo, both in terms of the concept and the amazing design. i liked inside as a conceptual successor even more. the eerie atmosphere, the dark setting and the overall game design of inside are impressive, a true work of art. the already great concept of limbo has been coherently expanded and improved in many respects. the game is very straightforward, you are thrown directly into the story without any explanation, the story only gradually reveals itself, but in many aspects it remains vague and open to interpretation until the end. it was very exciting to explore the game world with all its deadly dangers. compared to limbo, i often found the challenging puzzles and tests of skill much less frustrating. they never stopped me from enjoying the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i absolutely love inside. i think it is a perfect 2d puzzle platformer. i have already beaten it on the switch, but i just had to get it on steam and replay it again. it is creepy, stressful, and captivating. the art direction, the sound design, and the animations are all masterfully done. i also really like the handheld movement on the camera. it makes the game feel very immersive and cinematic. it may be a short experience but inside is the perfect example of quality over quantity."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,great experience with many memorable moments. amazing atmosphere coupled with thoughtprovoking extravagant storytelling with unexpectedly satisfying gameplay.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"a masterpiece of atmosphere and puzzle platforming inside by playdead is nothing short of a masterpiece. if you're a fan of atmospheric puzzleplatformers, this game should be at the top of your list. the game is visually stunning, featuring a dark, moody world that is full of mystery and tension. every scene is crafted with incredible attention to detail, with an eerie atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. the gameplay is simple but effective. you control a young boy navigating through a dystopian world filled with peril. the puzzles are integrated seamlessly into the environment, making each section feel like an organic part of the story. while the puzzles themselves aren't overly complex, they require you to think critically about how to progress, and the solutions are always satisfying when you figure them out. the real strength of inside lies in its ability to tell a gripping story without a single word of dialogue. the narrative is delivered through the environment, actions, and subtle details, creating an emotional connection to the protagonist and a desire to uncover the truth behind the strange world youre exploring. every moment is filled with tension, and the atmosphere alone is enough to make you feel both curious and unnerved. the games sound design is equally impressive, with ambient noises and a minimalist soundtrack that perfectly complements the worldbuilding. the sound effects help immerse you in the experience, whether it's the distant hum of machinery or the unsettling sounds of the world around you. while the game is relatively short, it's packed with memorable moments and puzzles that stay with you long after you finish. the pacing is excellent, and the ending, though open to interpretation, will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. overall, inside is a brilliant and haunting experience. it's a game that excels in atmosphere, narrative, and puzzle design. if you enjoy games that evoke emotion and make you think, this one is a mustplay. rating 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-06,"i've played this twice now and somehow my second playthrough hit even harder, it's been a while so i can't fully remember but what an incredible experience even the second time around... genuinely so few games can hope to capture the incredible beauty of inside. it's simply stunning in every way, fully recommend. the sound design and lighting in particular are stellar and elevate this beyond anything else. 1010"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-05,"every moment of the game is satisfying. the environmental storytelling is a masterpiece, and i love how the atmosphere captures simple details and makes them even more captivating. i keep coming back to play this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"this is a really interesting, fun and short game that makes you feel a lot of things. at first you begin the game right off the main menu screen seamlessly which was a really cool idea and like it a lot. you are seemingly a little boy in a really strange world but by the end there are a lot of theories what exactly is happening but you can read them yourself. this is an indie game everyone should play and own at some point if you haven't."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"overall highly recommend, even for people like me who usually do not enjoy puzzle games. pros  astonishingly simplistic graphics that make for beautiful, powerful scenery  fantastic sound design  smooth and dynamic animation  intriguing worldbuilding  an ending that changes the context of the entire game up until that point for me  perfectly balanced puzzle difficulty for people like me who are quickly frustrated by games like this, did not once have to get help from the internet to solve any of the puzzles and yet they were difficult enough to be a fun challenge and satisfying to figure out, getting stuck for no longer than 10 minutes at the most difficult puzzles  lots of room for interpretation and theories  simple controls  introductions of game mechanics are weaved subtly into the gameplay itself without any outright tutorial throwing too much information at you at once  genuinely suspenseful at times, in the kind of way that makes you hold your breath and press the buttons on the keyboard down way too hard even though you know it won't make you run faster  merciful, well thoughtout checkpoints which prevent you having to redo annoying sections of the map just to get back to a difficult part of a puzzle without dying  curiosity driving a need for exploration which is granted tenfold in this game  this game does not spell everything out for you and allows you to explore, interpret, experiment and be immersed  the gameplay and mechanics are built upon, evolved and spiced up at a satisfying pace to prevent gameplay becoming stale or too repetitive  short and snappy, nothing felt like filler content, i completed the game in just over 4 hours  all puzzles have logical solutions, unlike some other puzzle games where it feels like the only way to find the answer is pure luck potential cons  while most did not, a few puzzles involved timed stuff, which i am not too big a fan of. but these were rare, usually not that difficult and had closeby checkpoints to easily try again  i would not recommend this game to people who do not like heavy topics such as violence or mind control. this game is beautiful! but in a scary, bleak and occasionally sad way  far as i can tell you cannot pet the dogs  at the very start i had to go into the settings to see which button you had to press to interact with stuff, i personally did not mind this since it was only one single button i had to check one single time the controls are very simple but to all you tutorialenjoyers out there it could be a pet peeve at the start maybe it also showed me the button but i was too dumb to see it or something, this was just my experience conclusion i do not like platformers. i do not like puzzle games. this one changed my mind."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-03,"i did not expect to love this game as much as i did. the controls are so simple, but the complexities and sheer variety of puzzles coupled with the intricate depthdefying level design of a 2d environment really made me feel compelled to see that happens next. it felt like a bad dream in a good way."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"best use of show, dont tell. you'll see why the game is called inside later, it's a short 2hour puzzle platformer with some really well thought of puzzles and mechanics, and it frequently drops on a 90 sale. even if not on sale, highly recommend everyone to experience this once in their life."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"an amazing game. it a couple notches above limbo and it really shows. a gripping story where you don't understand what's going on. as you go on, some pieces might make sense, but on the whole no explanation is provided. haven't finished it yet, right at the end, but if you're looking for a game that makes your brain work, this is it. interesting puzzles, amazing world building, eery atmosphere and a unique look are things that make this game a must have if you like brain storming in your games. fully recommended."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"fantastically dark, fun puzzles  great mechanics!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game is the perfect embodiment show don't tell. the atmosphere and world building are probably the best i've ever seen in a platformer. it builds the world without any dialogue, but with great visuals, intricate gameplaypuzzles, and an amazing soundtrack. there's also dozens of secrets that only further rewards players with a keen eye with extra story beats. definitely a must buy for anybody."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"this game very emotional content , dont like little nightmare .. this game very straight lane storyline you just move foward very easy to play .. the puzzle very realistic enviroment . you should play this game"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"i don't really have much to say about this game, positive or negative. the atmosphere and aesthetics are great and the creative team clearly put in a lot of effort to bring out the mysterious and creepy vibe that they were trying to. a for that. the puzzles were okay. nothing felt particularly challenging but i also wasn't bored while playing. if you're someone who prioritises game play over everything else in a game then maybe you'd be better off with a different puzzle game. overall, solid few hours of entertainment and i can understand why steam has this at a 96 positive reviews."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,very good looking game incredibly interesting storyline and great atmosphere!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,after almost 20 hours of playing this game i still havent completed it so there are definitely a lot of levels and puzzles. if you get this game on sale like i did just for 2 euros then its a w and underrated. but if you buy it at full price 20 euros then its still goated but kinda mid cuz of the price
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-01,"i never even knew about this game until my wife told me about it after she saw some people playing it on tiktok. it was one of those rare occasions where she was really interested in playing something, so i got it and found out it was by the same developers as limbo, which i had played in the past. i got the bundle and sat there watching her play while offering ideas on how to solve different puzzles. they weren't that hard, in my opinion. we completed it in under 8 hours, including achievements. it's a short, quick game that may seem challenging for some players who haven't developed the habit of backtracking or mapping out an entire zone before advancing, or timing out some of the puzzles the shockwave one was the trickiest at the end with the rotating thing, but it's enjoyable overall. i liked the fact that it quick saves after each puzzle, so you don't have to go through a lot of solved stuff again. storywise, well, you just have to piece most of it together in your mind and come up with your own theories. personally, i would've liked more chases like in the beginning since those are what sold the game to us in those tiktoks with people playing it. it's a really cool game, but i still think that limbo is far superiorcreepier, darker, and scarier."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,gameplay time is not as long as limbo but the graphics and the gameplay is way more interesting. the fact that the surrounding and the characters are more realistic makes the game more fun.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,"fucking amazing game, great story"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,inside a must play game. its a puzzle adventure game just finished it and loved the whole journey!! the story goes like how a unknown factory runs test on humans and we the child stops it by completing multiple puzzles the puzzles are very good with a little twists. dont read any more reviews just go and play this!
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-28,a game was really fun with a good graphic and a good story i loved
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"incredible game, the artwork, storyline and interactions are all well thought out and executed. refined, elegant and clean. thoroughly enjoyed this."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"huge improvement over the developer's previous game, limbo. inside is creepy and a ton of fun. the dark and dismal world is bizarre and fascinating. the puzzles are intuitive but require some thought to work out. i enjoyed this game thoroughly, though i wasn't crazy about the anticlimactic ending."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,one of the greatest indie games of all times. inside tells a story which lets you decide what is going on. simple and effective graphics and gameplay. definitely worth a buy if you can catch this game and limbo on sale.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"very good game, just like limbo. would love for it to be longer, and for the devs to make more games"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"h1stellar sidescroller story tellingh1 what an interesting story and concept, i'd liken its mechanics and fidelity to little nightmares. very well put together, a masterpiece of art, with a story that will have you asking what's really going on, and with a splash of horror."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"its a really nice game. you are thrown into a world without any explanation, and that never change, because even now i am confused about what happened, what it was trying to say, or what the hell was going on. but that lack of explanation is actually charming after a while. i definitely recommend playing this game to anybody who is up for approx. 6 hours of total confusion and occasional laughter. personally i would rate this game 1010."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-26,"incredible how such a simple game can transmit so much fear, surprises and tension. also curiosity. i believe this is a masterpiece concept of a game. despite being 2.5d it is super entertaining and well worth going through it for both endings. recommended!"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-25,"h1 1010 h1 sorry that i'm comparing it to little nightmares, has a similar wibe.. this game is super depressive and unsettling in an amazing way! the graphics are both simple and beautiful and unsettling, the sounds fit perfectly. i'm not 100 sure what is going on with the story but it's fine, it does not answer all my questions which is ok. littlenightmares was more scarry, it had more horror elements, it was more grotex. inside is more grounded, yet it is just as unsettling as lnm or maybe even a little more, which is nice. the puzzles are really creative and fun and require both thinking and timing but not in a irritating amount. there are many checkpoints, so i did not have to replay already done sections over and over again which is a great plus. i had many ahaaa and oh nooo and oh yeahhh moments. the first playthrough was 3 hours, maybe i will go for all the hidden stuff, otherwise there is not much replayability, same as at lnm. 100 recommended, especially for that nobrainer 12 usdeur current price which contains their other game as well which i did not play yet.. inside was more recommended and i can see why it was so well received"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"great game, love puzzles mixed in with a game that makes you ask questions about whats going on, if you like a mystery game with a good puzzle then this is for you"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-24,"an excellent game of puzzle solving in a very atmospheric setting. very enjoyable, brilliant."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-23,"a quite unique atmosphere, nice animation and fluid movement, entertaining and accessible puzzles. i am very happy to have had the opportunity to play this game. 100 recommend!"

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"another terrific, sidescrolling platform game that told its dark and compelling story through constant movement and action. i finished it in 3.5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-21,"absolutely amazing game. visually stunning. mechanics are wonderful and fluid. kept me asking questions and begging for answers that leave me with more mystery than when i went in. i'm so curious about the universe and what led to the events of this game. i love being given the freedom to figure it out myself or try and put together the lore in my own assumptions. wonderful journey we get to go on, i loved how interesting and challenging the puzzles were. great job! inside my playthrough httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v3jqyw5v2q5yt7176s"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-20,"such a neat little game. a perfect game for those interested in atmospheric horror, puzzles, and stories that leave you scratching your head. i wish i could forget it so that i could experience it all over again."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"amusing to play but too easy especially if you played limbo. i wish it was more challenging. however, unlike limbo, it is generally shocking in the way the kid dies by gunshots and torn by dogs and the alternative reality. it gives lots of moments of what just happened?."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"what a fantastic game. the art style is definitely simplistic, but the amount of detail and effort gone into it all  the backgrounds, the lighting, etc.  a good bit of which you may never see, is stunning. i started off considering it a lot alike unravelunravel 2, but without even having a unique gameplay mechanic like that does, but it constantly improved upon itself and really blew me away. the balance between the challenge and a consistent pace of progression was really impressive, and only rarely annoying if figuring something out meant trips back and forth between spots. there are also really neat mechanics, which don't really stop being introduced even until the very end, but never confuse or overwhelm. inside's atmosphere is also utterly striking. as i touched on, i was skeptical early on, but at some point my cynicism faded away without my noticing and i was just totally immersed in the moment. the sound design is amazing and the nature of this absurd world is really easy to be intrigued by. along with that, there's a brilliant story, all told without any dialogue. i'm a huge fan of television and movies and have an absurd amount to watch in each of those mediums, so when i play a video game i'm never looking for a movie that i have to pay money to sit at my computer and press buttons at, i want something utilising this medium in specific. luckily, inside does this incredibly. as i already mentioned, all of the gameplay is very engaging, but the game in terms of visual storytelling utilises the video game medium and makes something that would undeniably be inferior as something else. spoilerrealising that the character you played as was only a vessel for the story, to be thrown away as an amalgamation of other people, just as people are dispensable in the corporate world we live in that this game depicts, is enough to make your heart sink. people are born as a product here, a child who makes it out has slipped through the cracks of this cold system, and once his path, unstoppable by your input, turns him into a monster, the masses turn on him while the individuals help him. he is cast out completely as a monster, but there is a sunny spot left for him where he may stay as long as he pleases. spoiler there's so much to reflect on in this game, but feeling it in the moment was incredible. loved this. 810"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"inside got me thinking a lot when i finished playing it the first time. i really enjoy dystopian games, movies, shows, books. great design and game play. the art style is spot on with the ambiance of the game."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"for a game that at first glance may seem like a walking simulator, it's genuinely still decent as a game, and as a silent story. wish the game was longer due to its linear gameplay for reference, i was able to complete the main story  collectable aside  in three hours wo a guide, and at 20 without a sale, it's a questionable pricing by modern standards. but as it goes frequently on sale for 1.99 usd  you should be able to pick up the game for pretty cheap eventually. while it may not per say be the most visually impressive game of all time, for a 2016 indie title, you have to give credit for how nice the game looks  in particular the underwater bubbling is pretty neat. beyond that, i don't have much to say in regards to it without going into spoilers, but as someone who doesn't typically find reaction to games  and even though i find traditional jumpscare horror to be ineffective once you get used to it  i do believe the game has its moments where you will feel dread and some disgust in moments. in short  if the game interests you, i highly recommend picking up on sale, rather than full price  due to its short runtime. but once you do find that opportunity, i think it'll keep you company once playing the first time around."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-12,"its a game where when you finish you are going to be like what have i just played, knowing its a masterpiece."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-27,"a beautiful, bleak, cinematic nightmare fuel. puzzles are challenging enough to be fun. the detailed physics of the game amazed me, especially the blob's. so many beautiful but uncomfortable situations, i ran through the game with so many questions in mind."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-02,"is freedom real, or is it just another illusion created by the very systems we seek to escape? these are the questions that inside left me with. at first glance, inside is a dark, eerie puzzleplatformer, but as i played, i realized it wasnt just about survival. the game explores society, control, and the unsettling truth that even rebellion can be manipulated. control, society, and the power structures at play one of the games core mechanics is the ability to control other people using a headsetlike device. some individuals are reduced to mindless puppets, obeying orders without resistance. others are imprisoned  caged but left alive, as if they serve no purpose beyond being contained. to me, this is a direct reflection of how society functions. capitalism, politics, and power structures are designed to control and use people. some are turned into obedient workers, while others, deemed useless, are simply locked away and ignored. the game doesnt show an active oppressor  it presents a system that maintains itself, where control is the default state. why a boy? the rebellious nature of youth the choice of protagonist  a young boy  stood out to me. unlike the controlled and imprisoned adults, the boy is vulnerable  every mistake results in death. this reflects how only at a young age do we question the system and try to break free. when you are young, you ask, why is society like this? how can i escape it? as you grow older, you either conform or exhaust yourself trying. the boy represents that phase of life where rebellion feels possible. but inside punishes every misstep harshly  just as society does to those who refuse to conform. the huddle a trap for revolutionaries eventually, the boy reaches the huddle, a grotesque mass of bodies. some players see this as a horrifying fate, but i see something more the huddle is made up of those who tried to break free before him. they werent destroyed  they were absorbed. maybe they were once rebels, just like the boy. maybe they tried to resist and were captured, studied, and turned into something controllable. even in its united form, the huddle remains connected to machines, still under control. this is one of the games most unsettling messages even revolution can be manipulated. even the strongest rebellion can be contained. does freedom even exist? at the end of the game, the huddle escapes  or so it seems. after crashing through barriers, it finally reaches a peaceful, sunlit area. and then nothing. the game just stops. no resolution, no victory. just silence. was this freedom? or a designed endpoint where the system knew it would end up all along? to me, this is insides final, haunting message if everything is built inside, then outside has no meaning. the boy believes he can find true freedom outside, but what if there is no outside? the world is structured to contain every possibility  including escape. if there is no true out"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"this game teaches you its mechanics by killing you until you get it. the ingame tutorial is almost nonexistent. would be a neutral review, but tends more towards positive."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-20,"inside is bleak, something to think about, unfortunately the world remains frustratingly elusive. hints and subtexts are found throughout, but there are no clear answers, i would have liked to know a little more. very reminiscent of the puzzles from aperture science from portal, only without humor and with much more existential horror. in some places funny references, it's a pity that the crowbar and freeman is not ours, apparently he did get to the water. who are those silent figures in the background? what is the true purpose of the mind control experiments? and most importantly, why doesit allseem so, uh. familiar? at times i expected to stumble upon a rusty crowbar, a relic of a scientist who finally made it to the water. but no, there's no escape or resistance here  just the quiet terror of submission."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"haunting, fun, and stays with you inside is one of those games that sucks you in right from the start and doesnt let go. theres no handholding, no dialoguejust you, a boy, and a world that feels unsettling in all the right ways. the gameplay is smooth, with clever puzzles and platforming that never feel frustrating, but what really makes this game special is the atmosphere. its eerie, mysterious, and full of moments that make you stop and wonder what the hell is actually going on. and the best part? everyone walks away with a different interpretation of the story. is it about control? free will? a dystopian nightmare? something even stranger? inside never gives you clear answers, and thats what makes it so brilliant. if you love games that are fun but also make you think and maybe even haunt you a little after youre done, this is a mustplay."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-15,silent storytelling masterpiece. this is gonna get tucked away in my single brain cell forever.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-04,a short but incredibly well done cinematic puzzle platformer.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-18,"save ur money, boring repetitive overrated game, not even worth on sale"
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-17,"managed to pick this up for less than two quid! on sale, this is a nobrainer. it's a fun, shortish horizonalish puzzler with updownleftrightgrab and that's it. nice game. no narrationcommentary, so you're working your way through the possible scenario as you go in your head. and it's dark. very dark! states it steam deck verified, but i wish you the best of luck finding some of the tiny little things you're supposed to spot to solve some of the puzzles. to be honest, there are are a few times where i've sold a section and thought yeah, that wasn't straightforward. but overall, brilliant. you should pick this up on sale and enjoy yourself !"

Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,i had a lot of fun! the puzzles were varied and welldesigned. some felt a bit unfair at timesat least until i checked the solutions then i just felt not the smartest. the mystical and eerie atmosphere added perfectly to the experience.
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"i completed after 3 days aof playing here and there for an hour at a time, i saw a post on 9gag showing the 3 doggo's near the fence and thought i'd try it, and oh my days!!! this game is something else, just wow!!, well done devs, and steam for making it cheap enough to buy, i have downloaded the limboinside pack and im still even after completing it wanting to play it again and complete the hidden parts, totally recommended and thank you to the person who posted it on 9gag."
Puzzle,Inside,2025-03-07,"i thought inside was just going to be an edgy platformer little did i know that it would be a superb blend of lighting, sound design, and ambience that couples with an intriguing setting that doesn't hold your hand to tell you what's going on. i love how inside just scatters information and leaves the player put together the pieces."

Puzzle,Inside,2025-02-19,"yes. just play the game! it's usually a one and done deal but this game is so good i played it 3 times!! this game is well made and vague enough to let you infer what you need to about it. this game is a great game to get into gaming and a game all people should play to have it under their belt! h3 pros h3 list it's a great puzzle game, hard enough to make you think, but not to hard where you'd need extra help to figure it out the art style is creative and unique the storyworld is captivating and interesting it's like 20 last time i checked so that's a pretty good price for a mind bending game list h3 cons h3 list the story can be quite hard to follow at time, you can feel lost or not know whats happening getting the secret ending definitely requires some help list that's literally all the cons. if you don't have the game already, get it. you won't regret it."
