"Another terrific, side-scrolling platform game that told its dark and compelling story through constant movement and action. I finished it in 3.5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it.",True,1,0,2025-02-21 23:43:27
"For a game that at first glance may seem like a walking simulator, it's genuinely still decent as a game, and as a silent story.

Wish the game was longer due to its linear gameplay (for reference, I was able to complete the main story - collectable aside - in three hours w/o a guide), and at $20 without a sale, it's a questionable pricing by modern standards.
But as it goes frequently on sale for $1.99 USD - you should be able to pick up the game for pretty cheap eventually.

While it may not per say be the most visually impressive game of all time, for a 2016 Indie title, you have to give credit for how nice the game looks - in particular the underwater bubbling is pretty neat.

Beyond that, I don't have much to say in regards to it without going into spoilers, but as someone who doesn't typically find reaction to games - and even though I find traditional jumpscare horror to be ineffective once you get used to it - I do believe the game has its moments where you will feel dread and some disgust in moments.

In short - if the game interests you, I highly recommend picking up on sale, rather than full price - due to its short runtime.
But once you do find that opportunity, I think it'll keep you company once playing the first time around.",True,1,0,2025-02-27 02:58:15

"Huge improvement over the developer's previous game, Limbo. Inside is creepy and a ton of fun. The dark and dismal world is bizarre and fascinating.

One of the greatest Indie games of all times.  Inside tells a story which lets you decide what is going on.  Simple and effective graphics and gameplay.  Definitely worth a buy if you can catch this game and Limbo on sale.,True,0,0,2025-02-27 01:02:20

"[h1]Stellar side-scroller story telling[/h1]

What an interesting story and concept, I'd liken its mechanics and fidelity to Little Nightmares. Very well put together, a masterpiece of art, with a story that will have you asking what's really going on, and with a splash of horror.",True,0,0,2025-02-26 12:27:26
"Its a really nice game. You are thrown into a world without any explanation, and that never change, because even now I am confused about what happened, what it was trying to say, or what the hell was going on.

"[h1] 10/10 [/h1]

sorry that I'm comparing it to Little Nightmares, has a similar wibe..
this game is super depressive and unsettling in an amazing way!  the graphics are both simple and beautiful and unsettling, the sounds fit perfectly. I'm not 100% sure what is going on with the story but it's fine, it does not answer all my questions which is OK.
LittleNightMares was more scarry, it had more horror elements, it was more grotex. INSIDE is more grounded, yet it is just as unsettling as LNM or maybe even a little more, which is nice. 
The puzzles are really creative and fun and require both thinking and timing but not in a irritating amount.
There are many checkpoints, so I did not have to replay already done sections over and over again which is a great PLUS.

I had many AHAAA and Oh NOOO and OH YEAHHH moments. The first playthrough was 3 hours, maybe I will go for all the hidden stuff, otherwise there is not much replayability, same as at LNM.

100% recommended, especially for that nobrainer 1-2 USD/EUR current price which contains their other game as well (which I did not play yet.. Inside was more recommended and I can see why it was so well received)

"Amusing to play but too easy especially if you played limbo. I wish it was more challenging. However, unlike limbo, it is generally shocking in the way the kid dies by gunshots and torn by dogs and the alternative reality. It gives lots of moments of ""what just happened?"".",True,1,0,2025-02-19 23:31:57
"What a fantastic game. The art style is definitely simplistic, but the amount of detail and effort gone into it all - the backgrounds, the lighting, etc. - a good bit of which you may never see, is stunning.

I started off considering it a lot alike Unravel/Unravel 2, but without even having a unique gameplay mechanic like that does, but it constantly improved upon itself and really blew me away. The balance between the challenge and a consistent pace of progression was really impressive, and only rarely annoying if figuring something out meant trips back and forth between spots. There are also really neat mechanics, which don't really stop being introduced even until the very end, but never confuse or overwhelm.

INSIDE's atmosphere is also utterly striking. As I touched on, I was skeptical early on, but at some point my cynicism faded away without my noticing and I was just totally immersed in the moment. The sound design is amazing and the nature of this absurd world is really easy to be intrigued by.

Along with that, there's a brilliant story, all told without any dialogue. I'm a huge fan of television and movies and have an absurd amount to watch in each of those mediums, so when I play a video game I'm never looking for a movie that I have to pay money to sit at my computer and press buttons at, I want something utilising this medium in specific. Luckily, INSIDE does this incredibly.

As I already mentioned, all of the gameplay is very engaging, but the game in terms of visual storytelling utilises the video game medium and makes something that would undeniably be inferior as something else. [spoiler]Realising that the character you played as was only a vessel for the story, to be thrown away as an amalgamation of other people, just as people are dispensable in the corporate world we live in that this game depicts, is enough to make your heart sink. People are born as a product here, a child who makes it out has slipped through the cracks of this cold system, and once his path, unstoppable by your input, turns him into a monster, the masses turn on him while the individuals help him. He is cast out completely as a monster, but there is a sunny spot left for him where he may stay as long as he pleases. [/spoiler]

There's so much to reflect on in this game, but feeling it in the moment was incredible. Loved this.

Extremely cool little game with an awesome atmosphere and intriguing setting. Even a little scary sometimes.,True,0,0,2025-02-17 09:38:53
In my experience Inside is very simple yet a very deep game. The puzzles can be challenging at times but in the end are very simple if you check your surroundings. I am not sure what the lore of the game is however through my first play through I've taken notes and wrote down theories for the events that happen in the game. Overall for the price and experience of the game it is amazing. I would recommend this game if you want an in depth and lore rich experience.,True,0,0,2025-02-17 01:06:47

"My definition for ""Master piece"" is when you can't add or remove anything from a piece without changing its point or diminishing its strength. INSIDE pass that test. It may not be your favorite game but it's perfection at what it does. That is thought inducing gameplay perfectly intricated into powerful art (not just the visual, audio is absolutely ace in that game too) to actually say things but not in a heavy handed way. Now that I write this I realise it's pretty much the opposite of ""What Remains of Edith Finch"" which was saying very little but in a very heavy handed way. A game I had reviewed negatively so I am happy to present with INSIDE evidence I like me some indy artsy game a lot when they're... well brilliant like that one.

One of my favourites when it comes to puzzle-platformer! I need MORE from PlayDead. The developpers know really well how to draw in a player with visual story-telling. It is those type of games where visual details help you understand the universe that the main character is set in and leaves room to the player to create their own theories of what the story is about which I love.

"This game drew me in. Made me interested from the beginning. AAA games don’t do that.

I've only just recently discovered this game and it is without a doubt one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life (and I'm 37 now). It’s probably the most fulfilling videogame experience I’ve ever had, and is easily one of my favourite games of all time. I went into it praying for more Limbo and it just held my standards down and pimp-slapped the sh*t out of them. I’m struggling to think of the last time a game made me step back and say ""Wow"". An absolute masterpiece. This game is the epitome of quality over quantity. There are games out there that last months to complete but are nowhere near as satisfying as Inside. 

Inside was honestly such a roller coaster of emotions. It's become one of my favorite games, and I was just impressed how it could just grasp my attention so well without any words. The art style, the simple gameplay, thoughtful puzzles throughout the game, etc. I loved it all. It was so thrilling and an amazing journey. Many atypical gamers might label Inside as pretentious gibberish, however I think that what Playdead managed to pull off here is really quite extraordinary. Much similarly to something like Journey, Inside attempts to immerse you in sound and visuals, whilst slowly peeling away bits of this mysterious world that you find yourself in. I could clearly see that they took and learned from limbo and expanded on it every single way, rather than attempting to do something on an absurd scale like most sequels tend to. If you feel alienated by this game, so be it, however I am happy that for once a game asked for my participation.

For those curious, Inside has the same amount of story as Limbo, i.e. not much at all. BUT theres just enough little bits of the world that will get people wondering and making theories for a long time. The atmosphere is one of the best ever. Don't know how else to put it. Everything just feels so creepy and wrong, even though you can never really put your finger on what exactly is happening in this world. The puzzles are good too. Very similar to Limbo's puzzles (push this block, climb that rope, do both of those things together) but with several cool new gimmicks that get thrown in later. 

In Inside, there could be a theoretical timeline of events leading up to the beginning of the story. You wander through environments thinking, ""My god, what happened here? Who did this and what were their motivations?"". By the time the credits roll, some of those questions may have been answered, most only hinted at, and others you will have to find closure with on your own terms. I love how you get dropped into a new situation and you can easily pick up what you're supposed to do from the cues. It's so brilliantly designed. I hate when any story dumps exposition into my ears, so having the world speak to me visually was enough. I'd stare at the background in awe or horror. It's crazy how intense it can be at times. In Limbo, the world is intriguing, but it doesn't feel as realistically inhabited as in Inside. This is easily one of the most unsettling horrible series of scenes and vignettes I've ever seen in videogames. It made me feel awful in the best way. The gameplay is more playdead, but streamlined and more thoughtful.

I think it's totally worth full price though, especially if you're looking for shorter experiences that you can complete if your gaming time is limited. I always think that Inside answers the question of why do we love videogames. It is a masterpiece, a 10 out of a fu*king 10, and everyone should experience it.

10/10",True,77,3,2024-12-14 23:03:18
"INSIDE is a masterfully crafted puzzle-platformer that showcases the brilliance of Playdead, the developers behind the iconic Limbo. Building on their signature style, INSIDE offers a dark, atmospheric journey that is equal parts haunting and captivating.

The game's minimalist approach to storytelling draws players into its mysterious world, leaving much to interpretation. The visuals are stunning, with a striking use of light, shadow, and sound that amplifies the eerie tone. The puzzles are clever and seamlessly integrated into the environment, ensuring the gameplay remains engaging from start to finish.

As a big fan of Limbo, INSIDE feels like an evolution of that same eerie charm, delivering a more refined experience with deeper emotional weight. It's an unforgettable journey that lingers with you long after the credits roll. Highly recommended for fans of atmospheric and thought-provoking games.",True,19,0,2025-01-20 08:07:04

"Inside is a puzzle-platformer set in a bleak, dystopian world. We control an unnamed boy, navigating through the environment as we solve puzzles to carry on. Deadly threats loom throughout and must be avoided in various ways. The story is open to interpretation, with no dialogue and only visual cues to guide us along. The game is artistically beautiful, replete with dark silhouette designs. This is a fairly short adventure but is a memorable, innovative experience. 
",True,12,0,2025-01-01 08:36:20
"INSIDE is quite a particular game, from the creators of LIMBO. It follows a similar gameplay loop, and even the way the story is told -or rather, not told- is also along the same lines. However, where I found LIMBO to be somewhat frustrating, I found myself enjoying this game quite a whole lot, even if I still had my issues with it.

Our story begins with an unnamed boy in an unnamed forest, being chased around by an unnamed group. And, as it stands, the whole game is like that; we get to see a lot of stuff happen, but we never get clear answers as to how this worlds works, only that it looks somewhat dystopian, and dare I say, decaying. Usually, I don't enjoy vague stories such as this one, but INSIDE had something in it that kept me going forward, wanting to, if not learn, at least see more of this world. I can't go into a lot more details about the story, as I feel doing so would spoil the experience, and this game is certainly an experience.

As for the gameplay, I already mentioned it's simlar to LIMBO. In case you're unfamiliar, it's a third-person platformer with puzzles and a small touch of exploration. There's no combat per-se, whenever there's enemies, or, as I'd prefer to call them in this case, hostile elements, your usual course of action is either avoiding them through stealth or outrunning them. Other than that, you'll have to move boxes, pull switches, push objects... Lots of puzzles sprinkled throughout the game. Personally, I found this part of the game (and the exploration itself) to be the better part of it; in regards to the presence of hostile elements, the dogs in particular, I found them somewhat annoying.

Sound design is quite minimal, but where the game makes use of sound, it makes an impact. Musical cues, soundtracks that faintly play in the background, I think it's all excellently crafted. And the art style is fantastic as well. While the gameplay remains 2D, the game makes good use of 3D environments, and the level design is great. Sure, you won't get to that platform far away in the background, but seeing it gives this game a huge sense of scale.

All in all, a solid experience, with an eerie atmosphere bordering on horror. I definitely recommend it.",True,9,0,2025-01-16 21:56:33

"Controversial. Yes, in the end I checked the box for recommending the game, but there is a ""but"" that lies in the fact it's not my genre (a 2.5D platform game) and I realized it only started playing it. One of the reasons I don't mark it as ""I don't recommend this game"" is because I didn't expect anything from it from the beginning and when I was buying it I was aware the game could turn out to be not my favotire genre. Another reason is that despite the platform, I was curious about the story. Its ending reserves many questions (which is not bad at all). If you're not sure about the game (same as I wasn't sure about it for some time) but want to discover a new type of games, I'd recommend to take a chance.",True,2,0,2025-01-16 17:22:38

"Inside Review After 100% Achievements on Steam ⚫✨

Inside is not just a game—it’s an eerie, atmospheric journey that pulls you into a dark and unsettling world. Completing all achievements feels like peeling back the layers of a haunting mystery, only to discover more questions than answers. Inside thrives on silence, ambiguity, and a masterful sense of dread.

Every puzzle, every step, and every visual detail are meticulously crafted to deliver a minimalist experience packed with emotional weight. It’s not about words—it’s about the world, the sounds, and what isn’t said. Achieving 100% was both satisfying and thought-provoking, but the game does have its limitations.

Positives:

Atmosphere: A haunting, immersive environment that draws you in and doesn’t let go.
Visual Storytelling: Stunning visuals and animations that tell a rich, layered story without a single word.
Sound Design: Subtle and powerful, where every sound contributes to the oppressive tension.
Puzzles: Clever, challenging, and seamlessly integrated into the narrative.
Negatives:

Short Length: Despite its brilliance, the game’s brevity leaves you craving more.
Ambiguity Overload: While the mysterious story is part of its charm, the lack of clear explanations may feel unsatisfying to some players.
Conclusion:
Inside is an unforgettable experience that delivers a perfect blend of art, atmosphere, and puzzles. It’s a dark, thought-provoking masterpiece that speaks in shadows and silence. However, its short playtime and deliberately vague storytelling might leave some players wanting more clarity. Still, it’s a game that proves “sometimes, the most powerful stories are told without words.”

Final Rating: 85/100 ⚫✨

"Amazing environmental storytelling. The ending was clever and satisfying. However, this is in dire need of an editor because it is way too long for what it is.

The beginning is excellent, as it sets up the mystery and puts you into the world, and nothing overstays its welcome as it shows you something new about every 30 seconds, which is about correct for a gameplay-light walking simulator where you're mostly just moving forwards. 
But towards the middle of the game, the world grows larger and larger making your progress slow down significantly. This would be fine, except not only did they just start reusing ideas, none of which were particularly difficult puzzles in the first place, more than a couple areas of the game (particularly the mermaid part) are just extremely tedious.

Would be a strong recommendation if it was about an hour shorter--if you start to get bored, maybe just look up a playthrough on YouTube.",False,3,0,2025-01-05 05:14:09

"Big fan, the visuals and ambient is good. The music and puzzles are also, of course, good. some of the puzzles might be a bit too hard but asides from that. the game has the good quality's LIMBO has.",True,1,1,2024-12-28 08:39:22
"This game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and intrigue, offering a truly unique experience that lingers long after the credits roll. The puzzles are just the right level of difficulty—not too easy, not too hard—and they feel incredibly interactive with the environment. It’s not just about solving puzzles; you really have to observe your surroundings, think critically, and make use of the world around you to progress.

The lore is another standout aspect. It’s mysterious and intentionally vague, leaving you to piece things together through your own observations and interpretations. The game doesn’t spoon-feed you answers, and that’s part of what makes it so engaging. It’s a world where you feel like a small part of a much larger, unsettling narrative, and figuring out what’s going on is as much about perception as it is about puzzle-solving.

Atmosphere-wise, Inside nails it. The dark, gloomy dystopian setting envelops you from start to finish. The background objects and events make the environment feel alive, and you’re simply caught up in this eerie world while trying to escape it. The sound design and music perfectly complement the tone of the game, creating tension and dread without overplaying it.

One particular highlight for me was the physics of the game. It adds to the immersion, making each moment feel more intense. The parts with the dog chasing you, especially, had me on edge. The dogs’ movements, sounds, and the overall physics made those sequences feel so real—it really made my heart race.

The game isn’t overly long, but it doesn’t need to be. It delivers a compact but thoroughly thrilling experience, and the mystery of the dystopian world stays with you long after you finish. If you enjoy atmospheric puzzle games with a touch of dark, psychological storytelling, Inside is definitely worth playing.",True,1,0,2025-01-20 09:28:37
"For a game that at first glance may seem like a walking simulator, it's genuinely still decent as a game, and as a silent story.

Wish the game was longer due to its linear gameplay (for reference, I was able to complete the main story - collectable aside - in three hours w/o a guide), and at $20 without a sale, it's a questionable pricing by modern standards.
But as it goes frequently on sale for $1.99 USD - you should be able to pick up the game for pretty cheap eventually.

While it may not per say be the most visually impressive game of all time, for a 2016 Indie title, you have to give credit for how nice the game looks - in particular the underwater bubbling is pretty neat.

Beyond that, I don't have much to say in regards to it without going into spoilers, but as someone who doesn't typically find reaction to games - and even though I find traditional jumpscare horror to be ineffective once you get used to it - I do believe the game has its moments where you will feel dread and some disgust in moments.

In short - if the game interests you, I highly recommend picking up on sale, rather than full price - due to its short runtime.
But once you do find that opportunity, I think it'll keep you company once playing the first time around.",True,1,0,2025-02-27 02:58:15
"Awesome game, I only wish it was longer, its a very immersive side scrolling adventure puzzle game with an incredible soundtrack on top of that the art design and animation is breath taking, truly on another level.

For anybody that says games are not very expressive art forms in their own footprint, I would show them this game to maybe sway the argument in the yes category, I guess semantics always wins out but this game does stand on its own.

"[h1] 10/10 [/h1]

sorry that I'm comparing it to Little Nightmares, has a similar wibe..
this game is super depressive and unsettling in an amazing way!  the graphics are both simple and beautiful and unsettling, the sounds fit perfectly. I'm not 100% sure what is going on with the story but it's fine, it does not answer all my questions which is OK.
LittleNightMares was more scarry, it had more horror elements, it was more grotex. INSIDE is more grounded, yet it is just as unsettling as LNM or maybe even a little more, which is nice. 
The puzzles are really creative and fun and require both thinking and timing but not in a irritating amount.
There are many checkpoints, so I did not have to replay already done sections over and over again which is a great PLUS.

I had many AHAAA and Oh NOOO and OH YEAHHH moments. The first playthrough was 3 hours, maybe I will go for all the hidden stuff, otherwise there is not much replayability, same as at LNM.

100% recommended, especially for that nobrainer 1-2 USD/EUR current price which contains their other game as well (which I did not play yet.. Inside was more recommended and I can see why it was so well received)

"Amusing to play but too easy especially if you played limbo. I wish it was more challenging.

It gives lots of moments of ""what just happened?"".",True,1,0,2025-02-19 23:31:57
"What a fantastic game. The art style is definitely simplistic, but the amount of detail and effort gone into it all - the backgrounds, the lighting, etc. - a good bit of which you may never see, is stunning.

I started off considering it a lot alike Unravel/Unravel 2, but without even having a unique gameplay mechanic like that does, but it constantly improved upon itself and really blew me away. The balance between the challenge and a consistent pace of progression was really impressive, and only rarely annoying if figuring something out meant trips back and forth between spots. There are also really neat mechanics, which don't really stop being introduced even until the very end, but never confuse or overwhelm.

INSIDE's atmosphere is also utterly striking. As I touched on, I was skeptical early on, but at some point my cynicism faded away without my noticing and I was just totally immersed in the moment. The sound design is amazing and the nature of this absurd world is really easy to be intrigued by.

Along with that, there's a brilliant story, all told without any dialogue. I'm a huge fan of television and movies and have an absurd amount to watch in each of those mediums, so when I play a video game I'm never looking for a movie that I have to pay money to sit at my computer and press buttons at, I want something utilising this medium in specific. Luckily, INSIDE does this incredibly.

As I already mentioned, all of the gameplay is very engaging, but the game in terms of visual storytelling utilises the video game medium and makes something that would undeniably be inferior as something else. [spoiler]Realising that the character you played as was only a vessel for the story, to be thrown away as an amalgamation of other people, just as people are dispensable in the corporate world we live in that this game depicts, is enough to make your heart sink. People are born as a product here, a child who makes it out has slipped through the cracks of this cold system, and once his path, unstoppable by your input, turns him into a monster, the masses turn on him while the individuals help him. He is cast out completely as a monster, but there is a sunny spot left for him where he may stay as long as he pleases. [/spoiler]

There's so much to reflect on in this game, but feeling it in the moment was incredible. Loved this.

"I can't exactly put my finger on why I love this game so much, but it is so good. It just sucks me in and I can't put it down. I wish so badly that it was longer.",True,0,0,2025-01-13 22:45:50
