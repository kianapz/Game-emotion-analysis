Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-20,"only one disturbing scene? heck, they were all disturbing. you could almost say they were filled with... little nightmares"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,they were just trying to return your wallet after you dropped it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"yup, just one really disturbing scene, the rest of the game was nothing but flowers and sunshine."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"damn, i found myself holding my breath just watching this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,reminds me of when no face goes full monsterhttpi.imgur.combuddbgl.jpg in spirited away.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-20,"the one scne with the boy and the rat caught in a trap is more disturbing. fun game though, loved every minute of it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i imagine this is what a cat feels like when all the toddlers of the family are brought together.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,so is this game little big planet on the brown acid?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,and this little gif has made me purchase the game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,this looks astoundingly fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,the most disturbing scene? i doubt it. the worst for me was when the little girl got hunger pains and savaged one of the gnome helper creatures.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,this reminds me of chihiro...

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,whoa
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"avoiding the adults was most of the gameplay when your character eats, however, was the single most disturbing scene."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"ah, yes. bed time at the white house for melania trump."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,''one'' disturbing scene?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,was i the only one that thought of spirited away after seeing this?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"spoiler imo, when the little gnome brought you food and you instead ate the fucking gnome got me the worst. this scene is pretty disturbing too though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"yeah, fuck this..."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,what do you mean one disturbing scene? isn't the whole game just a sequence of disturbing scenes backtoback?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,runnn!!!! lill tax payer!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"out of al the scenes, this one is the one that disturbed you? not the one where you consume the poor thing that just helped you?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,are those monsters portraing something or are they just ugly ass monsters?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i'm getting some spirted away flashbacks. but in all seriousness what is this game even about? i've never seen anyone actually finish it. they all stop playing after 23 levels and that doesn't tell you anything
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"that game honestly looks terrifying to me. not the jump scares you get out of a lot of games, but the 'wake up in the middle of the night sweating after playing it' kinda terrifying."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,all i could hear was symbiote doc ock

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"i love this game. there's something so magical and beautiful about following the adevntures of a child through a nightmarish hell, where they are for reasons unknown, able to traverse and hide expertly. the best stories like these are the ones that reveal the innocent child, was never innocent to begin with. and shows exactly why, they too are in the nightmare."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,dont stop running theyre hungry
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,well now i gotta see a gif of him getting caught and gobbled up!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,basically what spirited away would have been if kohaku hadn't helped shihiro after he found her in the city. or if the old boiler man hadn't helped her get her job. or if the water spirit wasn't a nice dude. or if no face was trying to eat her. i miss that movie.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"i always think creators stop well short of what is actually disturbing, perhaps because it's neither nice to work or have people experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,nope
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,damn! i had my heart in my mouth for the entire clip. where can i get this to play?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"this game had such an amazing art style. as well as that, i thought the gameplay and storytelling were pretty good. if you guys want to watch a play through, that isn't about jump scares and over the top screaming, i would recommend the scary game squad play through. 4 friends who play scary games. they try and figure out the story and have hilarious banter in all of the games they play. they sometimes don't play the game well, try not get pissed off"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,the janitor one is still the most disturbing thing of the game for me. my heart rate was so high...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,that's terrifying. i must see more of this game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"the real question is, is this scarier than the dead space franchise?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i think i'm missing something. why is this scene disturbing? it's just a chase scene. is it something happening in the back rooms after the doors open?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,do those things have a story behind them? either in the game or just japanese mythology in general? it's too specifically weird to just be a one and done spook.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-05-03,im just now discovering more and more little nightmares stuff since i found out about the game super late to this post but.. wow at the spirited away vibes. really dark and disturbing but awesome.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-20,"did anyone else think the dlc was garbage? i loved the base game, but thought the dlc was majorly lacking."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"looks amazing but where's the game? he jumped on a table, then a bigger table but nothing else hindered him from just running. it looks cool but with no tension it's not scary."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,suck it blues...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,that is doubtlessly one of the most pantsshitting moments i've ever seen in a game using a third person perspective.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"very studio ghibli, which really took me out of the game when i was playing it because the first 2 levels roughly half the game has no indication that it will go anime inspired in its second half. i think most people agree the first half is much more tim burton inspired, so what happened. friendly reminder that after the first 2 levels, the game just stops being scary in general. this whole level was mostly just an action scene. disclaimer i don't mean it stops being creepy, i mean it trades the slow unease of the beginning with outright exaggerated panic. with the exception of the twist, and the final boss battle, the last 2 levels of the game really drop the ball on building up atmosphere. fitting for the climax of the game, if it wasn't for the fact that little nightmares is really only 4 levels long. anyone that has played the dlc can tell me if it's more consistent in tone?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,only one? have you played this game? and all of its dlc? if you even seen the whole game or play the whole game and the dlc you wouldn't be saying that.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"graphics look solid as does the screenplay. but this level looks super easy, tbh. you just run and jump a few times? the first level of super mario bros looks harder plus being chased by nightmarish goombas. is there something else going on that makes this harder?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,is it just me or this it seem like this entire section lacked much gameplay
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"as someone who has never played this, what exactly is disturbing about this scene?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"fun fact the game was originally going to be called hunger, but the developers realized it would be a bit hard to find the game on google since hunger game brings up a lot of a completely different thing in the search results. they then went with little nightmares because of how small the children are compared to the other monsters in this game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"i love the suspense of chases in games where it all kinda goes in one direction, but then you gotta make a turn like that staircase in this gif and it feels like you're not getting any farther away but you have to go that way. except for in games where the chases break immersion when they're scripted based on your movements. in the dmc reboot most.of the limbo chases where the world collapses on you just freeze if you stop moving. they're scripted with your distance."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"if you haven't played this game, genuinely think of it as spirited away except replace the whimsy with hyperbolic grotesqueness. it's the absolutely easiest way to describe little nightmares."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"it is, i definitely recommend it if you like creepy and cute. it plays much like limbo with 3d and the art is some of the best i've ever seen. as for spooks, it can get very tense but the checkpoints are quick and generally forgiving so the terrible deaths you suffer aren't drawn out."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"watch over the garden wall. that describes that series perfectly. it's a 10 episode miniseries and each episode is only 11 minutes, so it's not too much of a commitment."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"there's been a lot of mr. rogers on reddit today. he said to some opthamologists to help them be less scary remember when you were a child? playing as a child vs a typical hero type pulls you back to childhood. maybe even the fear is your childhood fear... because fear never grows up hey, i like that line!."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"this is the vibe ive gotten from the trailers ive seen, it looks like a more nightmarish spirited away. which is awesome. i still need to play this, but i have to finish kingdom come and the shadow of the colossus remake first."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i agree absolutely.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,fuck.that. i saw spirited away in theaters when i was 5 or 6 and i bawled my eyes out because no face scared the fuck out of me and i left the theater. i've yet to actually watch this movie because of no face. that thing gave me serious nightmares. this clip just made me feel so fucking uncomfortable.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,yeah i though this myself especially the stairs and well the whole concept. pretty sure sprited away had a massive influence on this game.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,both markiplier and jacksepticeye have played it. i find it a little depressing that this should be a metric for a game's quality or success. booper dooper!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,what do i search for if i wanna see people playing this exact scene on youtube?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,yeah. did not expect that at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,it gets worse once you finish the dlc for the game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"damn man, i had just pushed it out of my mind..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,upon reading more i discovered it is released on ps4. i have a nintendo switch and was stoked to see it in the latest nintendo direct. i though it was a new game not an adaptation. thank you though!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,will be watching this later today! thanks for the info
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,nope. they just got the inspiration for this one from limbo and inside.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,it's a crazy good game. the first one was called limbo. followed by inside.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,um...what?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i feel dirty now
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"to be fair, he was talking about other scenes from this particular game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,this scene and the one where noface eats the frog horrified me as a child
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"spoilers, obviously. i believe the scene hes talking about is where the little girl in the raincoat the girl you control eats one of the small, cute creatures that pop up all over the game. you can hug them if you go next to them, and throughout the game theyre pictured as cute and innocent inhabitants of the boat. one of them offers you some sausage meat, and instead of eating the sausage you chop down on the little dude instead. afterwards, the little dudes act a lot more skittish around you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,even more disturbing stuff. the game is a trip man.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,yuuuuup
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,it's up for interpretation
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"ehh kind of. the developers specifically made the plot very intangible so that they could leave it up to the players to figure out what was going on. you need to piece together many aspects of the game to figure out the whole story, and besides the story isn't really why people play it, they play it cause it's nerve raking as hell getting chased by creepy monsters!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"i really enjoyed it, a lot of people complained because it was too short but actually, i feel it was just right. sometimes games can drag on, probably like this comment! and i get bored or start something else i never finish it, but if i recall, it is 4 hours or so, minus the dlc. the whole game is designed beautifully, the creepy sound, the music, animation and watching six, the protagonist evolve. usually i don't care for horror games, at all, i find them tedious, predictable and uneventful. i'll sit there with one hand on my straight face and sigh because the predictable jump scare didn't do anything, i especially find screaming over the top little youtubers a bit embarrassing but when it came to this game, it really hammered on the suspense and actually left me satisfied while still running to the internet to find what other people thought of the end and all the wacky theories. it's a great game, as long as you're aware that it's short so you're not disappointed. the one grip i did have was how the dlc was set up to play, it was very awkward to actually start, but maybe they fixed that. httpstore.steampowered.comapp424840littlenightmares it is often on sale for 50 off."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"you're welcome! i suppose it's not 100 accurate as it's not a complete and total nightmarish hell, but it definitely has a very nightmarish vibe."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,couldn't remember the name of limbo. ive played inside a decent amount. limbo not as much
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"ohhh ok. damn, i didnt know it gets to that level of horror. im only an hour in and nothing too crazy has happened so far. definitely going to get back to it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"even more spoilers, obviously. you know, i could just go on and on about spoilers. really, if your reading this far, hide this comment already if you don't want spoilers. the nome you end up eating is actually the boy you play as in the dlcs after the witch lady turned him into a nome."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"there are multiple protagonists, if you count the dlcs."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i hate jump scares but this game was awesome. platform scary games are the only ones i can play without shutting my pants. also the lack of story is amazing if you manage to piece it all together
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"nope, it's not mine."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,it totally did. what a wonderfully weird ass game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,yeah from what i have read the controller is you. you are the person in charge and controlling the boys. from the start you werent playing as the boy but as the blob controlling the boy.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,i am a huge pussy and i was loving inside. stopped playing at this part.  still have not finished.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,the part where the rope breaks and you end up in the water... then dragged to the depths... i have no idea what happened but it gave my goosebumps.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"little nightmares is really rough around the edges by comparison, the depth perception and some of the 3d platforming areas are no where near as refined and crafted as insides are. i liked the game but i have zero motivation to play through it again, inside on the other hand fascinated me beyond my wildest expectations, the world feels so more fathomable than little nightmares which didnt feel like it went beyond the ship you inhabit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-03-21,"i'm in the same boat, scared me as a kid but when i came back to it as an adult, i loved it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"any time i see an announcement by supermassive games, i get momentarily excited that supergiant is making a new game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"i'm a little worried since supermassive are mainly known for games like until dawn, the quarry and the dark pictures anthology."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"what a great time for me to have played through 1 and 2, i feel like i lucked out. can't wait to see what's next for six."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,it's not a coop right?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,yeaaaaaaah. instant wishlist!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,holy fucking shit lets mother fucking go
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"probably unpopular opinion but i liked the first game, the second was kinda weird. not in a story perspective, that was awesome but the controls felt super clunky and weird to handle. at least we get to know more of the story"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"ill probably play it anyway, im just a bit concerned about the coop. i know its an optional thing but i dont want the single player to feel compromised in any way  like while i play it in single player i dont want to be constantly reminded that its coop in a similar manner to something like dead space 3 by having those elements come first i.e. switchesdoors that require 2 people  or the ai  to open, and coop based puzzles etc. i kinda enjoyed the first two because they are immersive and solitary experiences. also the change in studio is a minor red flag. supermassive are a fantastic studio in terms of cinematic experiences  as a matter of fact i have just watched my fianc play the quarry and it was a blast ill be starting a playthrough soon, but i just dont know how theyll handle this kind of game  cant be hard surely, but im a bit skeptical that it wont feel the same. also little nightmares felt complete with the second game. these are just minor concerns of course, ill play itwatch reviews before committing to an opinion."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"i love the first two and was excited, and i still am but supermassive are the masters of the mediocre horror game. and if it's multiplayer that'll just ruin the atmosphere, which is the whole point of these games. there's no such thing as a scary multiplayer game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,i dont like this at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i love supermassive and i love little nightmares but im scratching my head at this combo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"ooh, i hope they do it justice, the little nightmares games are amongst my favourites of all time. i even bought the mobileonly very little nightmares. the only phone game i've ever bought."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-27,i just wish the trailer showed spookier monsters because the monster baby didnt seem as scary to me personally
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"i feel like cutting it off at two was good enough. it was one of the few games i thought was okay to just leave it off where it was without adding anything to it. sometimes, it's nice to have a weird ending that doesn't make sense but is explained and makes sense at the same time. little nightmares feels like that kind of game that should leave some edge to it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,hmm. i didn't know tarsier let the rights to the ip go after the second game. not sure i have much faith in this lol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"i love the first 2 little nightmares games, but i can't picture supermassive being the best dev for it. will be very happy if i'm proven wrong."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-29,"i feel like it wouldve been best to leave it at 2, maybe like a dlc or something but not a third one. not upset or anything but i feel like it wouldve been the best to leave it how it was if they feel like six and mono story is done. plus idk how i feel about a new studio taking the gears."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,oh no
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"great news, can't wait."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i love supermassive there games are dope but idk if little nightmares fits their development style

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"these games are too scary for me to play, but i'll gladly watch!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,no idea who supermassive games is but wooooooooooo little nightmares 3
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,hope it actually has gameplay and isnt just mediocre quick time events and 90 endings which are just scenes either missing or added to the actual like three endings.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,make it coop. last one had coop potential
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,but everything supermassive makes is shite.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,my fianc is going to be stoked
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"by now they must be big nightmares, ngl"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"love this series, the best surprise of the gamescon opening night."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i found the first one too ploddingly slow.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i am excited for this one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,what happened to tarsier?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,finally
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i already know the coop will be crazy
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"oh, yes!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,looks cool
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,"yay!first game was very interesting for me, i hope it's will be cool too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-18,"i have an idea. since last they said about coop ruining the horror atmosphere. how about still allowing coop but both players get to see story cutscene story differently throught different glass that gives different cutscene each or if it's online coop its 2 different cutscene with the twist they are enemies. that way it's still horror of at some point one have to betray the other. if people happen to stream with this idea, it's gonna look amazing. who decide to betray. who was playing the villain and does the victim knows?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"they're focusing on hades ii right now, which i hope is a strong enough sequel to stand proud alongside the original. after all, hades ii is basically the first time supergiant's done a fullon sequel to one of their games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,dammit i did the same thing
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,ohhhhh
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,i was wondering why they were making this while hades ll is still in the works lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,can't wait until supercolossal make a game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"that's what i'm also worried about. tarsier provided dark games for sure, but very elegant and with perfect pacing. i hope supermassive are up to the task."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"didn't they develop little nightmares 2 with tarsier studios? they might not screw this one up, if they understood what makes little nightmares good. from that trailer alone, it did seem like they nailed it, from gameplay to the tone and music. edit well, tarsier studios created little nightmares 1 and 2, while supermassive made the enhanced edition of ln2, so this will be their first attempt at a making a little nightmares game from the ground up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"supermassive was responsible for the enhanced edition of little nightmares 2, so they do have some experience with the franchise at least. i think it's in good hands, and it's good to see they're doing coop since it was an idea they were considering at tarsier."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"until dawn was pretty good,the quarry excluding the lives system rocked and the dark pictures anthology qas a mixed bag imo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,oh dang i thought it was the creator of hades and bastion. thats a bummer.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,woah there! i think you're getting ahead of yourself!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"if you haven't played it yet, download the mobile game. it's really good and the story is also connected to ln1."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,did you try the downloadable ones? with the kid
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"have a look for very little nightmares. it's a mobile game, viewed from an isometric perspective, and it is a prequel to the main games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,it is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,optional with ai
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-27,honestly thats a very common perspective since i heard a lot of people didnt like the controls
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-12,oh man i recall that flashlight hospital area was the worst in this regard.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,dead space was completely playable solo and the coop option didn't hamper it at all.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,just don't get it. the normal people will enjoy it just fine
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"scary isn't really what little nightmares is going for though, at least i never felt scared, more so just unsettled. i might be being a little too optimistic but i mean little nightmares 2 also had two main characters so it could work"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,there's no such thing as a scary multiplayer game i feel that the existence of phasmophobia disproves this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-27,ikr? if tarsier was still there i wouldnt mind tho
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"they didn't, they never had the rights. their publisher bandai namco did but tarsier got bought by embracer group."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,"they got the trailer to mostly match the aesthetics and theme, they have worked lightly on previous games. lets hope that the single player isnt compromised"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,they're busy on silent hill 2. also i think supermassive have potential. on the one hand yeah their games are basically the gaming version of b movie horror films but that's what they're going for.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,cause it doesnt continue from the last story from what it looks like?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,"dark picture anthology, the quarry, until dawn. all great games, but nothing like little nightmares"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"you watched the gameplay trailer, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,co op has been confirmed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,bro.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,no
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,no it didn't
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,until dawn?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,bought by embracer group.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,one of them said in an interview that they like to always challenge themselves to do something new with each game and doing a sequel was something new for them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,yeah supermassive are known for making what are basically the gaming version of b movie horror games. on the one hand that's what they aim for but that's not what little nightmares is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,my only complaint is that ln2 is too short
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,yeah. how dare they be optimistic
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,f
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"it kinda did tho, the balance of dead space 3 was tailored for coop, you have to play on hardest difficulty on solo or youre gonna breeze through with how much ammo and health they give you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"thats not what i meant, the game is playable in solo but it feels like it was made to be coop. there are moments where youll see multiple switches for a door but you only need to pull one in single player, and the fact that your buddy is randomly in cutscenes but not the game itself, plus the incredibly long encounters make it feel like it was made for 2 people."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,"i mean, im not in a rush to get it, but if i do then my expectations will be slightly lower. obvs know nobody is forcing me to buy it and all  this is just a first impression. could be a masterpiece for all i know."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,the point stands. no such thing as an unsettling multiplayer game. unless the thing unsettling you is battle passes and the like
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,"to be fair, the trailer looks spot on so i feel like presentation will be solid. and the gameplay of the previous games isn't exactly complex so it shouldn't be too hard to replicate and improve on. i'm definitely optimistic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-22,i mean it's even possible than 2 is a prequel.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"i was just being snarky because i didnt enjoy like any of the games past until dawn, im sure itll be fine"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,so why aren't they making this then?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,bastion sequel when.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"never played dark pictures, but i liked until dawn a lot. it did have a bmovie vibe at times, but it fairly innovative with its themes and had a pretty cool and scary story."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-01,they were talking about the main character
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,theres also single player
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,you mean you have to play on the hard difficulty for the game to be hard? shocker!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"cutscenes were a bit weird, but not a big issues, i had no problem with the encounters either playing solo. the whole coop thing is over exaggerated."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,to be fair it can be played singleplayer too which might be how i first do it. we'll just have to wait and see how it turns out really
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,you think the name little nightmares only applies to six and mono from the first 2 games?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"bandai namco, their old publisher, owns the rights to little nightmares."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,until dawn is generally seen as their best game. the dark pictures started off rough but got better.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"i think you misunderstood my point, even on the hardest difficulty the game is still very easy because the amount of health and ammo the game gives you is way more then one player needs because the game was balanced for 2 players not 1."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,goddamn. so it was basically snatched from the hands of the devs?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-09-11,agreed. their best work in the dark pictures was house of ashes which is considered the best one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"exactly this, its like the single player was an afterthought and they forgot to tweak everything, reduce healthammo dropsnumber of enemies plus the random doorsswitches designed for two people, also the fact that your coop partner is only present in cutscenes and isnt even ai controlled. completely cheapened the experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"it wasn't any easier than the other games, and the game can easily give less ammo when only one player is playing, so i really doubt your claim."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"it's hard to say, statements they made about not making a third game made it sound like they were fine with it but apparently they're making a similar game. unfortunately it's common for the publishers to own the rights."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"it very much was easier and it didnt. so doubt all you want bruh but its true, it was a common point of criticism along wit many other issues, look up any in depth or even basic reviews of ds3, chances are theyll mention it, ds3 was very mismanaged and its considered the black sheep of the trilogy."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,sources please.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"ugh, seriously bruh? look up any ds3 retrospective on youtube yourself, theyre plenty like avalanche reviews. believe me or dont, its up to you."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,"ok, i won't believe you then."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,lol ok
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-25,what a critical thinker!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,"considering i've played the game, why would i need to look up viewpoints of people that are clearly wrong?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-28,"yes, i am, i played the game, thought critically about my experience, and decided that the claim here was bs. blindly following others like you do is the exact opposite of a critical thinker."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,"feel free to stay ignorant, but the ds3 has a multitude of issues due to its troubled development and eas intervening, this is a fact, there are plenty sources you can look up that go more indepth, youre a big kid you can do that yourself."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-11-11,bro youe so damn dumb! like people know how bad ds3 was made!! what more prooof that god damn reality! no one give an sit if your opinion is different! since no one will think poop is tasty! even tho you might think that!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,"ds3 has a multitude of issues it really doesn't, saying the same thing over and over doesn't make it true. there are plenty sources so many sources you can't even cite one, lolol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-11-16,"come back when you can form proper sentences, then maybe your opinion on game development will hold any weight, because right now it is worth less than the poop your are so fascinated with right now."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,more excited for reanimal than ln3 tbh
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"oh, i'm about halfway through ln1 stuck in a puzzle, and now you tell me we are getting a 3rd one? great news indeed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,picture unrelated?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,goddamnit i wanna get into horror but i can't even get through the first 5 minutes of batdr without quitting out immediately after a scare and playing karaoke in yakuza 6 to calm down
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,only until dawn and silent hill games have my interest. i already have ud for ps4 though so i don't see a reason for me to buy it again.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,wtf is silent hill f thats such a bad name
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,excited for horro in da hood lol

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,at least some of these will still be crap.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i'm absolutely starving for slitherhead.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i didnt even know silent hill 2 was being remade and saw it recently and genuinely almost cried. i cant wait for the game to make my asshole clench
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,there's also zoochosis. current release date is 092324
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"can anyone recomend a list of good couch horror games to play through with roomates? to give more context, we did resident viii, and was great. we can change controller but the story was engaging and the fact there is hidden stuff around meant we can all kinda contribute and enjoy not playing. good jump scares as well. we have done some of the until dawn but they arent always that great tbf. just checked the occultist and seems up that aley."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"woah, gonna be a great october"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i am so excited for little nightmares 3, dissapointing that it got delayed into next year but still excited."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,wowwwwww
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"first i've even heard of the occultist, but seems really cool. this might be damning with faint praise, but reminds me of murdered soul suspect. and that game has some deep flaws, but the atmosphere always impressed me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i just cannot wait for little nightmares 3. three games in and we just now are getting coop.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i'm praying sh2 doesn't suck.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,forgot reanimal
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,most of these look underwhelming tbh. i expect more from indie horrors like conscript.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'm a bit concerned about little nightmares 3 given the studio change, but reanimal looks amazing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,tbh i think horror genre is having the time of its life. it seems like the only good games for psvr are horror games. too bad i am not a big fan of horror games. but that is on me! too scary.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,are they rebooting until dawn??
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,nice
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i just want something like soma again man. that was really the only game that terrified me to my core, playing on both my fear of the deep ocean and heights. plus the huge existential crisis it gave you was truly mind fucking."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,also hollowbody and post trauma from the indie devs.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,cant wait.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,very soon? it already started with fnaf and killer clowns from outer space
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"don't have a lot of faith in silent hill 2 remake, nor silent hill f."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"as someone who's played through ln, the dlc, and lnii and loved them, i very much doubt lniii will be able to capture the same magic being that the developers have changed."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,wait little nightmares 3 is comong out. lets gooooo
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"this might be a bit far fetched, but does anyone have good book recommendations that are similar to games these or other horror games? im reading a bit too much lighthearted stuff and im looking for some darker stuff."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,subliminal just has its trailer come out too
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,ln3 but no reanimal and is wack
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the filmmakers have to step it up since every day reality is such a nightmare.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"if you're a survival horror game fan looking for a great experience right now, please check out signalis"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,hasnt until dawn been around since 2014?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i love the dark pictures games i wish there was more sort of co op games like that
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,but why not all horror gaming fans around the globe? sounds unfair to only include the ones from the us.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,so far out of that list im only interested in silent hill as until dawn imo hasnt had that much of an upgrade and have no clue what the other games are
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,a hideo kojima game?!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"instead of wasting money on the until dawn remake, may i suggest buying it on ps4 for way less or emulating it? also were getting nightmare house 2 as a standalone game and the original mod is coming to steam."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,waiting for zoochosis myself. looks fun
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"didnt until dawn already make a second game with a new title because of a dispute developer had, whos doing the remake?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the thing is also getting a remaster by nightdive.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,im a bit of a wuss and dont normally play horror games but i recently competed still wakes the deep as it had a local setting. voice acting was fantastic and i enjoyed it despite the discomfort it caused my heart.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i don't have much faith in remakes and remasters
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,joooooosh nooooo
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,don't forget alien rogue incursion and metro vr even if they will be more like action and horrro
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"apart from those two silent hill games by konami, yeah."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i hope so.. now let's see how many come.out as buggy mess.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,what's the occultist? i haven't heard of that one yet.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,refreshing to not have to read eating well. i'm exited for until dawn remake on pc. i finally get to play it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,silent hill 2 is the only one to care about
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"cant forget about the original resident evil trilogy rereleasing on gog. httpswww.gog.comengameresidentevilbundle resident evil out now. resident evil 2 is tomorrow, august 27th. resident evil 3 by end of 2024."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,there have been tons of horror games coming out in the past several years. it's not like there has been a drought of them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"late to the party, but theres a game based on a quiet place coming out in october too!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i don't know if little nightmares is in the same horror group as silent hill.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"oh man, don't get the sh community started about sh2, half of them love it, and the other half are foaming at the mouth over how bad it'll be"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,is it until dawn 2 or a remaster orrr what??
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"unless i missed something, i didn't think silent hill f was anywhere near being released?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,there is more than what you put on here lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,already played until dawn. but little nightmares 3 and reanimal are gonna be so fucking good
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,alien rogue incursion is what i'm looking forward too. looks like a spiritual successor to isolation in vr
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,im extremely iffy on little nightmares 3 cause it's not the same guys as the first two. far as i'm aware its the ip owner the developers of the games didn't own the ip handing it over to someone else cause the original devs said they were finished after the first two
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"theres a quiet place game coming too, not really in the same league horrorwise as many of these but will probably have some tension at least."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"i am so jealous of the people that will be able to play silent hill f and 2 on release, the way it goes now i wont even have the time to get a sick week off and just play them."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,yummy yummy in my tummy
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"tormented souls 2 for me, geniunely surprised by the first one"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i think little nightmares 3 is not a horror game anymore. after seeing the trailer i lost my hype for it. the other game that looked like a little nightmares game was looking a lot better
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,is until dawn will receive remake or remasterd?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,isn't there a proper alien isolation sequel coming too?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,im a newbie when it comes to silent hill! the new one looks great but do you guys recommend i play the og first? eager to hear what the community thinks?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i cant wait for little nightmares. been waiting for that one for yearsss
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,isn't there already a until dawn? or is it a sequel or some sort?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"i'm waiting for the casting of frank stone, ngl"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,don't forget reanimal
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i'm worried about silent hill 2. i saw a couple things saying that it only rakes 20 to 25 hours to platinum the game. if true then i am going to pass on this game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,they are all getting pirated
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,adding the huge incoming wave of horrific indie games to this list and you can call it an avalanche
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,dont forget subliminal httpsyoutu.bekvfq6a2wywi?sintnlrkxu9mpwhwdhttpsyoutu.bekvfq6a2wywi?sintnlrkxu9mpwhwd
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i'm terrified and excited all at the same time
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i'd be into trying little nightmares 3!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,cant wait for ln3
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"i'll play little nightmares 3, for sure. but i am hype as hell for reanimal"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,wheres frank stone?!!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,more stable frame rate for until dawn ?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i'm not sure remakes and sequels count as being treated nice more like milked.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-28,little nightmares is my favorite. i lit love it bro
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-28,"little nightmare iii? i didn't know that a second one was released! gotta go after it, the first one is awesome!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-29,genuinely excited about ittt.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-29,little nightmares 3 ? no one tells me. i'll be happy to get more trauma.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-02,has anyone played still wakes the deep. i thought it was a good horror game. short but good
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-24,i'm so curious what silent hill f is going to be like i grew up on sh2 and 3 with the western titles in my teens. i'm so excited i hope they do the remake and f well
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,nothing like a few remake to really get the fans excited!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i would caution against being excited for silent hill 2 remake all signs point to it being mediocre at best. the company konami bafflingly chose has a history of mediocrity. anyone remember the medium? came out just a few years back and people have already forgotten about it cuz it was just mid. plus that free silent hill thing they released leading up to this remake was apparently really bad.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"after a short message, im not sure about silent hill f..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"wouldn't count silent hill 2 remake on there since it's made by hacks, but everything else looks lit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"not only us fans, but fans from the rest of the world too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,silent hill f? what is that? first i've heard of it. is this a legit sh game or another halfassed konami fuckup?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,id say the casting of frank stone deserves to be listed here more than some of the others
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,until dawn is getting the skyrim treatment it shouldn't be on there like it's new
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,until dawn came out ages ago? you can literally play it now lmao.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,silent hill f is going to be hot garbage i feel. if its anything like that last game they released
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"us horror gaming fans, 80 going towards playstation lol. im not gonna see most of them for years"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,paying 6070 for supermassive's worst choice based game is certainly a choice
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"wtf is the third game, how did you put in the same list as the others"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"idk, i'd consider myself a horror gaming fan but am not looking forward to any of this except for maybe the kojima game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,iwillnotbuyondayone iwillnotbuyondayone iwillnotbuyondayone iwillnotbuyondayone
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,also the until dawn movie the scene looks amazing
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,everybody sleeping on amnesia the bunker
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,don't lie to yourself od is never coming out and silent hill 2 is going to tank. f is in purgatory like good and evil2
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the only miss on here is od  that trailer was horrendous
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,what about the callisto protocol? just went on gamepass and thinking about trying it out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'm so tired of seeing until dawn. it was great when it came out, but i'm done seeing it being released over and over again. at this point i'm more excited for the silent hill 2 remake. also, little nightmares iii is being made by a different developer now. the original devs said they were done with that world, and they're working on reanimal. oh, and we harvest shadows looks good too, so don't forget about that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,silent hill f isnt in the near future is it? seems like its still far away as there hasnt been any news in a while and given the silent hill brand i am not sure if i am actually hyped about a new game. od is also far off no as kojima is focusing on death stranding 2? until dawn is just a remaster or did they add new content? no idea what the nightmare and occultist are so cant say. about little nightmares 3 the last video at gamescom killed my hype about it. seems really lifeless after the original developer moved on and reanimal looks way better than whatever little nightmares 3 is supposed to be.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,no reanimal???
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,god please for the love of christ just no more online coop horror games.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,what's very soon? some of these don't even have steam pages yet. other's have unspecified release dates in 2025. nothing soon about this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,the one in the top left looks ai generated same for the one in the bottom left
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,"maybe you shouldn't praise games without knowing if it won't end a buggy, disapoointing mess of a game with mostly negative or mixed reviews."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,exclude until dawn from here and its good list
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,removed
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,until dawn is a remaster and remake
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i think we are going to wait a lot for it agreed. it'll be a ps6xbox whateverthefuck title.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"he specifically said that work on the espionage game will start after ds2. od and ds2 are being developed currently. and, at this point, ds2 is in the polish stage. so i plan hope to see od soon."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i can only hope its going to be a p.t type game expanding on it of course not the infinite loops but that type of scaryness i can onlyyyy hope
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,od is coming after death stranding 2 for sure.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,is there any other video released about od other than that purple dinosaur speech video?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,isn't the last game named psyint?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,hate that egoticstic guy. too full of himself.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,the studio behind the little nightmares games are also making a new horror game separate from l n with the same type of gameplay but cranked up to 40 i don't know what it's called but it's trailer is out and looks promising
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,ryukishi07 is goated
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,no way its him? never played a silent hill game before but i'm definitely getting that one
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,a new silent hill game? cool!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"as someone who doesnt know higurashi, i really want to see more of it. like, will it be a visual novel type thing? im so intrigued by that original trailer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"i think it looks the right amount of unsettling and uncomfortable. that combined with the setting is enough to get me interested in the game. so kind of curious, who is higurashi?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"it's gonna take a while. the console team at creative assembly who developed alien isolation has pretty much been axed due to the disastrous development of the cancelled hyenas. maybe someone other than ca will take up the mantles, who knows"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,what timeline would you propose the game explore?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"omg yes, it needs a sequel but i dont mind if they take alot of time for it. its hard to top that game or even make it an equal experience"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,or at least an 4k remaster with all the dlc.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"it will be really hard to improve on that, to write a new story on the same level and separate unnecessary tedium from necessary. not even saying to add new game features without shifting balance in either side"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,rogue incursion is looking to be somewhat similar
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,that trailer looked super good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,hk has never had anything to do with silent hill 2 wtf
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i didn't know about horror in da hood but its looking fresh and its free
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,silent hill 2 without hideo kojima. silent hill 2 without dwayne johnson. silent hill 2 without kevin hart. probably gonna suck since these guys arent working on it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,do we get norman reedus still?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,bloober team is making it so its gonna be at best mangled
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,with bloober behind it its gonna be real bad. maybe theyll add a new ending where maria convinces james to shoot himself because hes mentally disturbed
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i loved metal gear but i'm honestly glad kojima isn't involved. death stranding has some of the worst writing i've ever experienced in any media. honestly mg after 3 was pretty bad too, dude can't write dialogue to save his life. he has some interesting ideas but people don't talk like he writes them. it's terrible. okay rant over lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,it looks like they've already missed the point of silent hill 2's story from the trailer music alone honestly.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,yeap. imo ln3 reveal was a little underwhelming. reanimal looks amazing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,that game looks sick af. i am more hyped about this than little nightmares 3 tbh.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i personally think they both look great, but ln3 has me a bit more, probably the nostalgia talking"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,both have coop so im dragging my friend into both of them
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,still personally incredibly disappointed that the devs of ln3 are refusing to add local coop for some stupid reason. but i was very pleased to hear reanimal is going to have local coop d
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i wouldn't trust konami with a pair of safety scissors
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the previews seemed very positive
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"like paratrooper said the previews seem to be positive, but with most games these days i wanna see the reviews first before buying the game or considering it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the bits i've seen don't instill a lot of confidence
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i don't either with mgs delta but i gotta give credit what we've seen so far is actually very impressive
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"it has looked pretty uninteresting to me because it looks like its doing the bare minimum of a modern day remake. when you compare it to the re remakes, there was so much new life put into it while still perfectly capturing what made the original so good. the silent hill two remake in comparison looks stiff and stale, as if it was just phoned in and uninspired. i also think a lot of what made silent hill 2 such a classic is how they worked around the technical limitations at the time. i also have zero belief in team blooper. having played a lot of their games they never went beyond mid quality at best."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'm sitting here thinking fuck, i should finish the first one"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"that series gave me a trauma, just reading the name brings back the memories"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'd definitely recommend checking out stalker gamma while you wait! the stalker community remade the monolith engine that the original stalker games ran on and made their own game called stalker anomaly. then this dude grok released a mod pack with a full installer called gamma. i never played the older stalker games but gamma is without a doubt my favorite shooter of all time. best of all, it's 100 free. the base game is free and the mod pack is free while receiving constant updates."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i know nothing about it. what excites you about it?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,basically the actual little nightmares 3 considering it's made by the same devs.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,after below zeros lack of horror aspect i don't think subnautica 2 would be any more of a horror than the original
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,subnautica 3 iron lung now this would be an interesting collab
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,it's happening!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,is it really called silent hill f? that's a weird title.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,yup literally played it for the first time on ps5 late last year and was very impressed
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,cheeky breeki
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,hahaha good ol' bendy. well i'd say little nightmares is another good game to start. it's really upsetting though but it doesn't have many jumpscares
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"im the same way, but i loved until dawn. its more like a movie."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,supposedly the remake will have more possible deaths and some new scenes
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,don't forget supermassive's next horror game directive 8020. it's their next dark pictures game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,maybe it has something to do with music since the f is written as a clef.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,yeah the name is eh but the idea is very good
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,supermassive be feeding us
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"as dbd fan, i can't freaking wait."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,maybe in 20 years on the ps9
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"you mean, there's a remothered iii?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"thanks, ill check it out"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,and with games becoming more realistic they def have to step up their game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,they completely remastered the game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,apparently its a remake which doesn't make sense... usually people remake like 20 year old games but until dawn is still really new
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i liked the medium
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i wouldnt call silent hill the short message really bad. it just wasnt what silent hill fans wanted. it was better received by those new to the franchise. though, youre right about bloober  weird company to helm a remake of a beloved horror game when their track record isnt great."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,they have nothing to do with each other
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,got me there hahaha
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"us, as in 'we'. i thought the same when i read the title, haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"silent hill  is an upcoming survival horror video game developed by neobards entertainment and published by konami as the ninth mainline game in the silent hill franchise. in a departure from the majority of previous entries in the series, the game takes place in 1960s rural japan instead of the titular town."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"op doesnt include casting of frank stone, which comes out in a week, but makes sure to include horror in da hood lmao"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,one can only hope
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,wow.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,this sounds like ai lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"kinda crazy how xbox killed their own naming conventions right out of the gate with 360. meanwhile sony just adds 1, calls it a day and is infinitely easier to know what the latest model is."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i really think it'd be funny as hell if they just drop the xbox 2 after all these years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,xbox series playstation
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"yeah, didn't he also say that he wants to push the graphics to indistinguishable from a movie? i feel like that game is definitely in the works for future hardware"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,at this point i would not be surprised to microsoft name it xbox 2 just to fuck everybody.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,ps6 and xbox gamepass superultrafuckyou edition
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"lol, we never know what to expect with xbox names"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"there is a little leaked gameplay online. not sure how reflective it is of the intended release, but it seems to be a third person game with the goal of making you scream so you lose. generally games like that are somewhat procedurally generated to keep things fresh on replay, but it's kojimbo, so i assume there will be a decent amount of scripted story content too. i'm guessing it's mostly looking for stuff, light puzzles, and very light stealth mechanics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,the alien isolation tram actually split a long time ago. it was closer to after isolation being released. the actual people who worked on isolation were long gone before hyenas was even revealed.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,the timeline of setting the game after the first one and clearing up the cliffhanger they left it on.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,where did i say that? i said that hes not there. he worked on a silent hill game before
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,silent hill 2 without dwayne johnson muffled metallic voice can you smeeeelelelel ... what the head ... is cookin
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,can you even call it metal gear hill 2 rumble in the jungle without these guys? i heard michael bay isn't even being consulted for it anymore.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,maybe a different ending will help the game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,something about ln just doesn't feel right. that reanimal trailer has me ready though
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"ln2 was a bit of a let down, so i hope the third picks up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,if anything both the gameplay and visuals from reanimal look more like the og little nightmares than ln3 imo.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"reanimal is basically little nightmares 3 named differently because they don't develop the ip anymore. i don't really trust supermassive with making a truly creepy atmosphere and interesting unique experience since their 5 most recent games all were juse sizably worse versions of until dawn but i guess we'll see. either way this is the best of both worlds. tarsier said they weren't going to make another ln game regardless of being acquired, so now we get what tarsier are making and ln3."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"regardless people are right in being cautious with konami, they've mishandled a lot of remasters in the past decade, and their last big ip release for consoles and pc was metal gear survive... reputation matters a lot, and konami will have to have some gaming renaissance like capcom had in the late 2010s till now in order for gamers to trust konami again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"sh fans will eat up anything though, theyre starved."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-29,you shouldnt compare silent hill 2 remake to resident evil remakes. it should be compared to the original. silent hill will never ever play like resident evil and never should.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"gamma is so good. the stalker community has been warning people not to expect stalker 2 to be like gamma, which for me is a little bit of a buzzkill. the way that gamma refined the gameplay in stalker was a chefs kiss, and i'm worried stalker 2 will be too video gamey. that being said its still my most anticipated game. day one baby"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,it's a joke. just look at the trailer.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vl38ez15tvki
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"the original may not have been intended as a horror experience, but it was certainly filled with horrific little moments."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,yeah i finished that and the og which was less scary and only had like 2 true jumpscares tbh. loved it so now im trying
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i remember.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,isnt the casting of frank stone their next game?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,kind of looks like f as in forte in music... meaning loud. would be a strange turn to name it silent hill loud though
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"as far as i can tell, that isn't happening, unfortunately. not that i got around to finishing the second game yet lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"what a waste of resources. wasnt it kinda perfect? i mean how much can you improve on a walking dead, telltaleesque linear storytelling game thats more of a tv series with qtes? is hayden panettieres forehead extra shiny? or did they actually turn it into a whole ass game?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,nah the short message sucked. if it wasn't what the fans were looking for then it wasn't silent hill. it's like passing a dahr mann video as a christopher nolan movie.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"gosh, i can't believe that silent hill a short message and silent hill f have nothing to do with each other. i guess i was just being silly. on an unrelated note, isn't it weird how silent hill homecoming and silent hill dounpour and silent hill book of memories are all completely unrelated except for being games shoved out to small studios with small budgets and fast turn around? konami wouldn't do that again would they? what with silent hill ascention and silent hill a short message being as good and well reviewed as they are."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,also a story for silent hill  should be written by ryukishi07 who is wellknown japanese author of several horror visual novels. one of his the most famous works higurashi no nako koro ni takes place in rural japan of 80s which is somewhat close setting. this is easily one of the most interesting silent hill projects in years
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"yup, there's also reanimal, directive 8020, post trauma, slitterhead, the sinking city 2 and so many more...horror in da hood is just out of place here sorry op"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"from a marketing standpoint it makes sense because xbox was always gonna be a number behind and that's not good from a a casual consumer point of view. parents going out to buy their kids a new videogame... what do you want, the playstation 3 or the xbox 2? so i think 360 was pretty good choice on its own.. but then every other choice they made after was idiotic."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"yup, i have xbox one, and i have no idea what the latest xbox is called."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,nah. it'll be the xbox uno.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,xbox series x 2.0
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,introducing the xbox live.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"if they call it xbox two im going to not buy it, just like i did with xbox one"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i mean i was just playing hellblade 2. shit looked fucking incredible. maybe not necessarily a movie? but there was no difference between cutscenes and gameplay. the gameplay looked better than cutscenes in other games. it looks simply spectacular
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"he worked on pt not an actual released full game. i dont know why people think kojima is important to silent hill games because he sure as shit isnt, if you said team silent then its a different discussion"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,oh well
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,it definitely doesnt need a 6th? ending tacked on by bloober the mentally traumatized are better off killing themselves team.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,imo ln3 trailer has a similar resident evil 5 effect on me. having a companion makes it less scary. horrors are much frightening when fighting alone edit plus avoiding the gaze mechanich hiding behind an object is getting really old.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,low key ln1 was only good because of the aesthetics ripped from ghibli lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"that's cause reanimal is made by the same people as ln1 and 2, who due to corporate stuff lost the rights to their own ip, and the company who owns them hired another studio to make ln3 to milk as much money as possible"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,you say that but for more than half of the time sh2 remake has been announced theyve done nothing but complain about it lmfao. it wasnt until the last set of trailers dropped that they seemed to turn around and say its starting to look good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i feel called out.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-30,"youre missing my point. i'm not saying the silent hill remake should be exactly like resident evil. what i'm saying is that the silent hill remake lacks inspiration and new life injected into the source material. without those two things, it makes the remake redundant"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i did and i was confused if people were actually excited for it or not it looks ridiculous
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,hearing something massive close by while swimming in murky water made me shit my pants harder than any monster jumpscare or creepy room.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,this guys profile picture is the dark pictures logo for anyone who doesnt get it
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,its kinda poetic tho
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i mean you're not wrong lol. they had to do something to make it not seem inferior because bigger numberbetter, so they just made it confusing instead"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"first i thought wow that's very clever, then i thought, who cares if you skip a number, like windows 9"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"they have a chance to remedy that this generation by going with xbox 6. xbox, xbox 360 and xbox one gets us to three. then cheat on a technicality and treat series x and series s as two separate consoles to bring us to five. it's not the most straightforward logic, but it's not particularly egregious either. they don't feel like direct revisions of each other like the midgen refreshes do to their base hardware. it's the optimal chance to right their naming convention in my opinion. who am i kidding, microsoft are going to call it the xbox axv02 before revealing that there will be playstationexclusive cosmetics in the next halo game or something..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,they did kinda shit on that when they went with xbox one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"they took a page from the numbering strategy of basically every brand that came out later than their competitors. iosandroid, iphonegalaxy, iefirefoxchrome, intelamd, nvidiaati, etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,series x or series s i think.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,xbox 720
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,ya know what? they might actually go for that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"game wasn't great imo, but visually beautiful and the best game i've ever seen. worth it for that reason alone. without spoiling, there's a scene with a tornado that's just mindblowingly cool."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,im not sure what you mean. i loved that demo and it would have been a silenthill game so imho it would have been great to have him onboard
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,one thing i think we can all agree on is that p.t was and still is legendary
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,one of the endings in the original game is !james killing himself.!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'm fine with coop horror, even reanimal is coop i belive. i think it's that the characters looked overdesigned. i feel like most characters in the past had 1 or 2 things special about them and the 3rd game looks like they have more than that going on especially with the weapons"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'm well aware. my point is their game didn't have to look like little nightmares.. maybe they went into another direction. but since it does.. and they are the og developers... there's no reason to feel nostalgic for the actual franchise in comparison to reanimal, like op said, when the new entry does't even look and feel as much like the previous ones."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-30,i disagree. third person over the head camera doesnt mean it lacks inspiration or copies tlou or resident evil. if anything the gameplay snippets theyve shown looks like a natural evolution of silent hill if the series lived long enough to make the jump to the ps4 generation
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"exactly! for many people, subnautica constitutes a horror gaming experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,happy cakeday!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"they are the worst at consistency. it used to be windows 2000, xp, and vista. then they suddenly numbered it as 7...8...10?!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"i'm calling it, it's gonna be xbox squared. or make the console a cube and call it xbox cubed. alternatively, i don't think they'll actually make another console. i think they're going to lean way too hard into this cloud shit they're doing. and i'm saying this as a life long xbox fan."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"or just do their own thing but at least make it intuitive. use an a, b, c scale.. tie it to a decade.. whatever the hell doesn't involve a jump from one x to series x lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-28,"which is usually just shortened to series to include both of them, which i'm not sure if that is better or worse."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"yeah, i have no clue where they can go from here."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"im just a few hours in, but im really loving it. especially compared to the first one. i mean its cool that they made such a game, but i just absolutely couldnt get through the first one. the puzzles were awful. and the graphics made me nauseous.. but its like everything is improved. this is the hellblade they always wanted to make, the first one feels like a demo compared to this."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,would have is the key words. we have no idea how a total game would have ended up. but yes the demoexperience was really good. but hk was never a integral part of what made silent hill good horror games is the point.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,it single handedly revitalized resident evil which is hilarious.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,i know that. im clearly talking about a new ending akin to the medium that would make james shooting himself senseless and tasteless.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"oh don't get me wrong, i agree with you"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-30,you're still missing the point. i didn't say anything about a camera. read it again
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,i wonder if the next one will be windows 13 or if it's time to jump to something completely different.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,they've already said they're working on the next generation xbox.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,"yeah, i agree, microsoft gaming..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"huh, i actually feel like the first one is a bit better. i like the combat a lot more. feels more freeflowing and open, and the 1v2 or 1v3 are epic feeling at times. glad you're enjoying it, though. i think the last few hours are the best, so it only gets better from here"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,yeah he's not that important to the silent hill games by itself. i did see some rumors that he had input on em though. but yeah he's not an important factor in them.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-26,"all the endings in the original game were varied to some degree, so i really don't see them making an ending that's effectively no different from a preexisting one. they've already said all original endings will be in the remake. i've never played a bloober game, but i'm willing to give this one a shot, and both masahiro ito and akira yamaoka being heavily involved makes me feel better about it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-30,"yeah i used the camera element just as a slight explanation. i fail to see how its doing the bare minimum. if anything mgs delta is doing the bare minimum for a remake. as far as ive seen silent hill 2 remake checks the boxes for what a good remake should do. improve boss fights, levels, character models, voice acting and combat. everything is better"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-08-27,welcome to windows series x baby!!!!!

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i played recv shortly after it released on dreamcast and loved it...i am pleased to see that it held up well enough that someone college aged enjoyed a playthrough 24 years later.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,thats awesome. good worklife balance. maybe add a little more sleep. keep up the good work in both you gaming library and education
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,that is some good gaming p. how was scorn ?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i wish i could forget scorn so i can replay it again. that first time through was equal parts horrifying and mystified.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,gun survivor whattttt love to see people playing that still. its like a 6 out of 10. but it's a very special kind of 6.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"inscryption is a work of art. anyone who hasn't played it...don't google a thing just jump in. little nightmares ii is better than the first one, maybe give that a go ahead of the 3rd one coming out soon?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,resident evil survivor is 5 plsssssssssss
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"firewatch, nice. i bet it helped you ease off your mind from the routine."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,have you played the alan wake series yet? great games if you like horror especially 2 since 1 is a bit more of an action game

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,the pain of playing resident evil survivor is offset by the euphoria of resident evil nemesis
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,hell yeah. what did you think of the resident evil games you played?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,you play the remakes of the re games? i was wondering how you felt about them compared ti the originals.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,ooh survivor was fun. i remember staying the night at a friends house once and he had a ps1 with it. he said he didnt like the game because he couldnt get past a part in the opening. i tried it out and figured out how to open the manhole cover with the crowbar. i figured i was on a roll so i just kept on playing when he went to bed. he was surprised to see me still playing when he woke up the next morning. even more so when he realized i just beat the game. i liked the first person twist on the re formula. id not played many games up until that point so it was a unique experience for me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,itt people who think college is a huge time commitment.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,excellent taste my man.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"resident evil really is fantastic, original re2 is still one of my favorite video games of all time. glad to see you enjoyed it so much! i'd highly recommend checking out the original version of re1 just to see where it all started. and if you proceed further with the series consider playing both versions of 4, i think i like the original more for replayability but they were both worth playing in their own right. leon is the goat."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,im telling mom
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,is this on steam? are the resident evils on steam? i have just the remakes
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,why would you ever play resident evil survivor? its not good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,why original re23 but not original re1?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i just got done playing resident evil 2 for the first time ever. i've never played a resident evil game before. fucking phenomenal! i'm hooked. i want to play them all now.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,weak. each one of those games takes 2 days of small gaming sessions to beat.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i thought i would have more time on my hands for gaming after i graduated college and got rid of all the homework. turns out my grownup job is completely mentally exhausting and i barely play 2 games a year now, and only on weekends. im single too, couldnt imagine trying to play games with a spouse and kids. enjoy life while you can op"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,good selection of games. i am a fan of resident evil. i hope you are still going to college. don't drop it out!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,inscryption is definitely a 65. i'd also put fire watch as at minimum a 45. survivor i also didn't care for at all. now scorn was such a frustrating experience to me for some reason.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i beat the moon once. with no crystals. and an ability that gives me health back when i activate my shield. and a weapon that gave me a very high double jump ability.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,yea i sunk 20 hours into it the past month and it went by so quick. cant wait to recommend it to my girlfriends little brother when it releases on the ps5 haha got to get someone else addicted
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i love that you guys are all worried about my academics  im doing okay and i have a 3.74 gpa. kind of stressed about getting an internship though
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,instantly became one of my favorite games absolutely amazing gem !i was sad for leshy by the end!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"it was great, the second act was a slog, but the third was great again."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i was very intrigued by the first act, and then the rest of the game didn't really live up to it for me. i had fun with the gameplay, but there weren't really any satisfying answers to the questions posed early on in the game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i thought the art direction was phenomenal i think most people share this opinion and the vibes were good but i felt kind of disinterested by the end. i dont regret finishing it though and i am looking forward to their co op farm themed horror game theyre releasing
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,honestly i think i had trouble liking it coming off the high that was resident evil 2. i really liked the park area towards the end though and i liked the characters. cant wait to play the remakes of 2 and 3 this winter!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i am old enough to be op's father. that is a list i respect.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,ive heard good things. ill try it some dayalthough maybe i shouldnt you factorio players seem to be trapped
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i think hardnot totally sure though
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i was so disappointed by the ending and i wanted to be emotional but it just didnt do it for me. really good game though and i enjoyed it!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,freedom comes with a price  what game do i play next
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,maybe ill skip that whole career thing and retire nowno videogames sounds lame
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i hope he scares me extra good in the remake
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i cant seem to put it down will definitely 100 it
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i realize it does look that way but i think this was just a coincidence haha
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"ill definitely play it someday, just havent got around to it yet"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,3.74hopefully i can get it up a bit with my finals this week
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"yea, infinite backlog. its great. i leave little notes for myself about what i thought and give them a star review. i just use it in a browser though i dont think they have an app. so far, im really loving resident evil and cant wait to get to some more recent entries!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"haha i liked the arcadey feel and didnt totally hate it, it just has a hard time competing with these other games. i was thoroughly disappointed when code veronica was happening on a different island i 100 thought thered be a crossover"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,well i have to do something in my freetime haha
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"if you like dishonored for the gameplay, its okay and worth playing. i didnt love the story as it was told mainly through like documents and stuff and it was sort of hard to follow. i liked the characters though. i kind of ran the same loadout the whole game too so i didnt feel reason to explore and get more guns. worth a try i guess but honestly only if you liked dishonored alot. if you havent, just go play dishonored instead"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"not op here, i played it but didn't beat it. definitely had some fun with it for awhile but eventually got sick of the fact that the loop means you end up doing a lot of the same prep work again and again. also i seem to recall the online aspect had some performance issues. i would recommend trying it for yourself if you can get it cheap or play it through gamepass or something. op mentioned playing dishonored instead if you haven't played that, i'd agree that's probably a good call."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"yup, im a marketing major with a co major in fashion design i want to be a designer but worst case scenario i work as a marketer for a cool company. applied for a playstation internship this summer"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,nooo the second half of the game is crazy you missed out fr. that guy sucked though i had to go back to an old save to get enough ammo and heals to beat him. not an re game without a stupidly hard boss im somehow never prepared for
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"if it makes you feel better almost everyone gets stuck there their first time playing and has to restart. so you should try it again sometime. maybe utilize more of the save state slots this time though to make sure you have multiple backups ready to go, that's the worst when you end up softlocking yourself like that. i've been there before, my condolences."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,heroic probably. i honestly dont remember but i dont think i woudve done anything lower than that. another commenter informed me legendary is pretty crazy
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"never tried final fantasy, but if i did, i fear it would take me a long time to work up to ff16 haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i started ori and although the music is fire i dont really enjoy it that much. im sure ill finish it but it might be a while. inscryption was so amazing and its definitely in my top games
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,im pushing my friend to play it because i need someone to talk to about it with haha. loved it
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i thought the atmosphere was amazing and i thought about it alot afterwards. impactful experience. i dont think i was ever really weirded out because i went in kind of expecting that but it was quite the spectacle
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"to be fair, some of the games are quite short. i dont think ill be finishing any more in december unless i burn through the re2 remake, but im only starting that once im on winter break"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,its a unique game with great voice acting. its pretty much a walking simulator so if you can get past that its a short and sweet experience. i think 3.55 is the perfect rating for it but some people love it more than i
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,hmmmmmm ill check it out for sure
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"visually it was great, took me longer than 2 hours...more like 4 or 5 i think. it has a couple really good puzzles imo but the gameplay itself is normally quite bad. it really really stuck with me afterwards and i couldnt stop thinking about like what i saw and the meaning of it. its more of an experience if anything and its beautiful in a gross way"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"its great if you know what you're getting into. it was like walking through a 34hr dark surrealism art exhibit. if that sounds like something you'd dig, it'll be awesome but if not...best go for something else."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,honestly it just made me want to play dishonored
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,im sure it will be nostalgic to meeventually
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i had fun until the very end. i missed the grenade launcher so i ended up having to fight the final boss with only a pistol. he was easy to fight, but with a pistol, it took a whole hour straight without dying to kill him"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,it's pretty fun with a guncon if you ever got a chance to try it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,thats awesome! cant say im pulling many all nighters but im definitely waking up for those 8ams
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,inscryption is in my top games now and probably my favorite game ive played all year re 2 being a close second
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"man everyone wants to know about scorn haha. it was seriously a great experience, hesitant to recommend it to everyone though because its definitely not for everyone"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"exactly my thoughts on inscryption! honestly after playing the first, i dont even understand why there needed to be a second let alone a third. if i see it for cheap and i have lots of time to kill ill definitely try the second but theres many more games id like to play before that lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,i liked the arcade shooter feeling.i realize survivor came out long before ipadsbut it felt like an ipad game lol. in a good way
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,i wanna try it! i have never completed a story mode game. a break from fps games maybe hehe.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i do like horror, but i think these recently played makes it look like i like it more than i do lol. so heres the thingi sort of hated alan wake 1. i played it maybe 4 years ago and at the start i was enthralled by the story but the point flashlight and shoot gameplay got so boring that i hated it by the endmaybe ill get around to 2 since i heard it was good but the first one left a bad taste in my mouth despite being a cult classic"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,noooo
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i just finished it a few hours ago and although i really liked the characters and the gameplay was pretty fun i wish the story was told in a more linear way i like my cutscenes i just wish it explained to me !why colt got amnesia and then started to remember, why juliana seems to always remember, why it doesnt affect anyone else like this i guess cause theyre related?? and i just wish more was explained and included about the island that was explicitly provided to me within the story! if that makes sense. word vomit"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,youre right i had no idea  which one???
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"for the gameplay, no. some of the puzzles were really good, but for the most part, it was a drag. however the experience itself had me kind of in awe and it really stuck with me afterwards. ive grown really fond of it after finishing, but while playing it i just cant say i liked it very much. idk its just a great experience in a not great game. its short too 5 hours. i want to recommend it, but i am also hesitant to do so because peoples opinions on it vary so greatly"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"minimal gunplay, average puzzles, great eerie atmosphere, not very long. i enjoyed it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"scorn is quite hellish and horny in its own messy way so youre not far off. in regards to halo i played halo ce and reach maybe 4 years ago, i played halo 4 as a kid but didnt pay much attention to the story, and played halo 5 as a kid too but didnt touch the story at all. so im experiencing the story for the first time really, albeit quite slowly since i seem to i keep putting them down"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,cuz we all drop mages after they prove useless in raids
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i dont want to talk about my survivor experience. i got to the final boss with nothing but a pistol. i swear to god it actually took a whole hour to beat him. not like with deaths, a whole hour of fighting straight"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i loved them. took me a while to get into the remake of the first one but once i got far enough in i fell in love. loved the originals ive played and cant wait to try the 2 and 3 remakes this winter break
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"not yet, when i try a new series i always start from the beginning so i made sure to play the originals first except i started with the remake of the first one. im going play the 2 and 3 remakes this winter"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i would but i dont think this subreddit allows me to comment images lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"just finished the story for most of them, although i am addicted enough to roboquest to 100 that. i hear halo 2 100 is tough"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,marketing haha i have a co major in fashion design and i had a digital marketing minor but dropped it cause of the course load. doing like 19 credit hours
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"its not too bad and i definitely take more courses than most of my peers, just dont let the homework build up and youre okay normally. obviously there are rough weeks but generally i have a good amount of free time"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i knowwww its on my list for sure for sure especially since i liked dinos as a kid
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,thanks  i try to play alot of different games but this past few months really seem to have had a horror themeim not complaining though since they were all pretty enjoyable
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i 100 have re2 in my top games aswell. i think ill play the original orignal sometime but not anytime soon. probably whenever i can get my hands on a physical copy. taking a break from re for a bit because playing all these back to back is alot but i cant wait to try 4
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,why  no
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,the remake of the first one is but i emulated all the others. i liked them enough to collect them physically when i get a chance but unfortunately theyre not on steam. im looking forward to playing the remakes myself!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i have to play them all!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"not sure. picked up the 1 remake like a year ago, hardly played it. then i seriously tried to play it, ended up loving it by the end and decided to proceed based on release date since i was interested. ill play the original of 1 eventually, but i dont want to backtrack right now"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,yea re 2 is pretty phenomenal. ive enjoyed all of them so far!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i cant wait to get into 4! im going to play the remakes of 2 and 3 over this winter break but i hear 4 is a favorite! sorry if my halo 2 rating is too low  if it makes you feel any better i got halfway through halo 3 and i think that one will be a 55 for sure loving it so far i did put it down for a bit though
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"no combat at all. just walking, a bit of running, and some jumping. all story driven and a bit of explore this area to find this thing. short and worth playing because the characters are pretty well written imo but i have to admit i was a little let down by the conclusion of the game. good vibes though"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i studied for 2 today before finishing deathloop!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"it is a gem, i was just let down by how the mystery ended. but maybe i was supposed to be. the voice actors did great though and i liked their relationship throughout the game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,why thank you
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"risk of rain is something ill play eventually. ive played what remains of edith finch and it was pretty unique, i didnt love it but i liked it. never heard of that last one ill look it up"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,really put me through it thinking ark was vincent
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i loved scorn. some good puzzles, bad combat. it made me think at the end and really stuck with me. worthwhile experience in my opinion but not the best 'game'. it seems like you either love it or hate it. and my gpa is 3.74"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"it was incredible in my opinion. some people think a certain portion of the game is a slog, and i agree, but some like it. instantly became one of my top games ever. it managed to subvert so many of my expectations by always adjusting the gameplay. really really awesome game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"story and some side content. typically i dont go out of my way to 100 games because i normally dont play them after finishing the story and only return to replay years later, at which point i just want to play the story again haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,maybe i will...cant be that hard...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i don't work fulltime right now, so that helps alot. i get lots of time to relax on tuesday and thursday but my other days can be quite busy. i think most weeks, its not more than single digits unless i really have no classwork for whatever reason. i hate the lack of money this brings though...time to go home and work hella over break"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"in my own personal opinion, yes, i loved it. but others dont always say the same"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i liked re2 wayyyyyy more than 3. maybe ill have the opposite opinion on the remakes as you too. but probably not, i really loved re2"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,real
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"yes, thats exactly how i had the time to do it haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i knowsickening behavior
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i can get behind this opinion. specifically the part where you go on the ship or maybe leave a ship i dont remember, i thought that was beautiful plus the music was good."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,what would you recommend i add before the year is over?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i agree, surpassed all my expectations"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i hope i can find time to play videogames in the future, even if only on weekends that sounds great. im enjoying it now either way!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i wont be dropping out haha. yes i am now a fan myself of resident evil and cant wait to try some of the more recent entries!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i heard its roughmaybe ill try it out sometime
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,haha im sorryyyyy i didnt really like it that much i mean the art direction is incredible forsure but it was just kinda eh to me
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-15,hes just good at time management
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,i too felt like i was wandering in a maze at the beginning lol i get that
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,well im playing roughly in release order so i have to tackle re zero first. and i plan on playing the remakes of 2 and 3 over winter break. id guess i might make it to re4 in like april depending on when i start re zero. i hear good things about re4 so im definitely excited
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,its a unique game with great voice acting. its pretty much a walking simulator so if you can get past that its a short and sweet experience. imo definitely not a must play but some people do consider it one. if you have gamepass cant hurt to try
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-15,oh my bad let me take this down real quick
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i almost tapped out in the first hour but i ended up liking it. once you get a bit into the thick of it it plays just like dishonored so i didnt have a bad time. and i finished it pretty quick 6.5 hours.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i loved it so much haha. figure you disagree?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"another commenter asked so i checked haha. i have a 3.74 gpa, my lowest grade right now is an 88 and some a minuses. hopefully i can squeeze them into a territory with these 6 finals i have this week"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,id love to see a risk of rain game that played like this.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,they also just added the endless mode update which is quite fun!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"if the person interviewing you is a gamer, use that to your advantage."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,you got this!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i love the evolution of thinking leshy is the villain to find out he was just playing a part
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i completely disagree. the second act was my favorite part of the game, and i was really sad that it ended so suddenly. it reminded me a lot of snk vs capcom card fight for the neo geo pocket."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"oh man, funny enough i actually felt the opposite, loved act 2 but got tired of act 3. fantastic game, all around though. really had fun with kaycee's mod too. also shoutout to deathloop, while not a classic i had a ton of fun rolling through it. dishonored is one of my top series so just getting more of that gameplay style was such a treat."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,second act is just too easy. i shouldn't be able to beat every fight on my first try by just auto creating a deck. third act has the best mechanics but the aesthetic and atmosphere aren't nearly as good as the first.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i struggled with act 2 and just dropped the game after locking myself from progressing twice. just felt frustrating more than challenging. i enjoyed act 1 a lot, and i loved slay the spire enough to 100 it, i played tcgs as a kid. but act 2 was just not fun for me. any tips would be great, so maybe i can go back and enjoy act 3."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i agree second act was a slog, but the end of the second act was fire and really rejuvenated me for the third"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"if you're interested, i personally think little nightmares 2 is better in every way than the first"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"i agree 100. it was a fun game, i liked it, and the art direction is a 1010. however, to me, it was too similar to limbo and inside. while this isn't necessarily a problem, i felt there was a lack of surprise factor, as if i had played the game before."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"fascinating, i liked the park the least and loved the city start of 3 because i was left with wanting to explore the city in 2, since you get confined to the station very quickly and only get a very quick taste of the outdoors, so the start of 3 not to mention the introduction of nemesis were amazing to me, really wish i could go back the 25 years it has been since i played those for the first time. i remember talking about secrets we found ingame for hours on end at school!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,people call it cracktorio for a reason.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"heroic i'm guessing. there is no legendary, i think? with halo 2 lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i liked the ending a lot. you know your character wanted to meet the girl on the radio but the game teaches a valuable lesson that you don't always get the fairytale ending you hoped for.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"nah bro, what did you want? for them to meet each other and fall in love and live happily ever after? anyways, red lantern also made me feel emotions if you're looking for another story driven game like that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,ultrakill maybe?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i'm still playing video games. just don't get the time to finish one before the next must play comes out lol.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,oh you sweet summer child.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"the gunplay is just so addicting, i did the same thing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,hell yeah dude
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i turned off the multiplayer aspect because it seemed like something that would stress me out haha. i realize i probably did miss out on a big part of the game playing that way but i dont want people ruining my missions out of the blue that sounds scary
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,nice. what year are you?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,it caught me by surprise because i was sure i had enough ammo for him. cant tell you what i had at the time but i know it looked like it was enough? i am pretty sure i had enough firepower to get him to 90 percent of the way to a one box defeat but since it is damage gated i had to play out the entire fight. it was a war of attrition at that point that i was destined to lose lol. i had zero ammo and zero heals at that point and then it was me on the ground with two xs on my eyes xx
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,xx
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"for sure, man. thats awesome as halo 2 is my first xbox experience so huge. what did you think of the campaign?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,the good news is most of them are their own story so you can play out of order. big resident evil fan and i am glad code veronica made your list.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-31,"ori is in my top 10, both games easily. i will admit that the 2nd one is more enjoyable but i still love the first one."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i'm in the same boat brother. no one to talk to about inscryption or signalis cause no one i know has played them. i'm like that pablo escobar meme, just sitting by myself with my own thoughts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,good luck with your studies! see you out here
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,cool p. well it is on gamepass so i should check it out. i guess it is more of an experience than a fps?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"it is a good game just take your time with it, breathe it in."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,treat it like an interactive movie rather than a game and you'll have a great time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"so if i'm being  a lot of people on the ralanwake sub don't even like the first one. they all say the gameplay is too dated boring etc. but 2 is just about universally praised. it won a lot of goty awards last year along with bg3, that one earning more goty awards let's be real but those two games swept last year's awards. also idk if you know this but it's also tied into control. dunno if you played that but that's also an amazing game. i played it after aw2 and was amazed by how fluid the game is. you throw shit at enemies and hover and stuff. it's definitely a power fantasy. plays like a metroidvania anyhow, great games on your list. i really enjoyed halo 2, firewatch, and resident evil 2"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"alan wake 2 is one of the most well designed games in terms of both setsetting and gameplay. the first one definitely has charm but starts to feel a little cheesy, whereas the sequel everything has weight to it from the manner of interpreting clues to feeling the recoil of your weapon as you fire in the dark. 55 game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"it stuck with me too, so much so that i searched this thread for anyone talking about it. i dreaded the combat but the atmosphere is unlike anything i've ever experienced. they should have either leaned more into scarce, more horrorlike encounters or way more of the fucked up, gorey world interaction. i don't know what kind of price it's at on different platforms, but i'd say like 30 or less for the experience i got out of it is well worth it to me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,its a work of art. see it as a walking simulator. the art design is insane.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"damn, you keep saying as a kid to halo 4 and 5i assume you dont mean like17 years old, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"if real life had a boss fight, it'd be playing that game, and there is no reward at the end. just the relief of no longer suffering through it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"awesome. for what its worth, i bought re remake on gamecube the day it was released, and still play it to this day! ive also owned re2 on pretty much every platform known to man. absolute classics. have you tried tormented souls? its a newish fixed camera survival horror game and usually not too expensive. havent checked it out yet, but its in my steam library ready to go! reviews are pretty decent so im keen to give it a go. stay well my friend, happy christmas!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,3 is my favorite from the series. reach also kicks ass. you'd probably like dead space as well
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"thanks for the response im gonna go for it tonight, see what its all about!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,nice. still better completion rate than me. ive probably only finished 5 or so games in the last year.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,the gameplay was a little weird and time consuming. but i found the evniroment and story to be perfectly alien in every way. it was quite the experience
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,so how you didn't do more games despite having so much free time?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"its so simple but its amazing, the 2nd one is pretty good too"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-14,you seem like you have enough energy that i bet you can keep it going. i know plenty of work peers who do have more responsibilities than me and somehow find time to play every night. good luck!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,try skyrim ad borderlands too bro
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,i will try
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,just tell your teachers that you completed the old resident evil games. that's got to be worth some extra credit.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-15,now post your sleep schedule
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i applied for a few, but one im particularly interested in is a summer internship at playstation so fingers crossed! maybe i can talk about the perseverance it took beating some of those bullshit re bosses"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"the second act made me think, oh wow! what is this game!?!? what could be next! act 3 was like, oh, its kind of like act 1. ill admit, i hate card games, and mostly played inscription for for its weird, meta, storytelling. act 3 was an absolute slog for me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i will consider playing 2 if i see it on a steep sale i guess. what are the chances epic games gives me the second one for free this holiday season
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i don't feel that way exactly, it was great but there was a couple frustrating sections with the partner's ai, and having a partner either you was cool but also drew back from the horror angle a little bit. still an excellent game, still on par if not better than the first. also the runaway kid dlc from 1 is worth it"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"not yet, but ill get around to it. playing all these back to back got me tired so im taking a break, then playing 23 remakes, and then illl maybe play outbreak. i picked up re operation raccoon city for the xbox 360 but havent played it yet"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,everyday i wish i was like 10 in the 90s so i couldve experienced the resident evil games in that way  i yearn to sit criss cross applesauce in front of a crt tv
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,the factory must grow
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,ah youre definitely right. i knew i hadnt played on the hardest just couldnt remember what the difficulties were actually called. i tried doing laso on reach a few years ago and never made it far
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"i agree, that part didnt bother me as much, i think it really captured the feeling of an ending summer, but i was totally let down by the conclusion of the mystery"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,ill check out red lantern thanks for the recommendation. i think i was just let down by the conclusion of the mystery and less so the way their relationship ended
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,red lantern if it's anything like firewatch i'll enjoy it. 80 off at the moment too. one more game for the backlog.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,seen it before and im sure ill like it. this is the push i needed
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,thats so good to hear! hopefully i dont become boring and rotten and i keep liking interesting things none of the adults in my life play video games and im trying to break that family curse
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,sophomore
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i liked the gravemind guy and thought he was interesting although i was kind of perplexed as to how he was teleporting us around all the time. the beginning i did not like but there were some great missions towards the end. love all of the religious turning on prophets and stuff pretty good. afterwards i played through half of halo 3 then took a break but so far halo 3 is by far my favorite in terms of storymissions
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i loved code veronica! and i was surprised to find that some people really didnt like it when i looked at others reviews of the game after i finished it. and ive heard that final fantasy are their own stories generally but i think id like to start at the beginning anyways just to kind of get to know the whole series if that makes sense
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,exactly. its clunky at times and i almost put it down but im so glad i finished it cause it ended up really sticking with me afterwards
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,thanks. i'll try it!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"yea i played control a bit! graphics impressed me alot and the throwing stuff was cool however i just idk the gameplay feels flat to me? not sure but i never finished it, not even necessarily because i didnt like it but honestly because of not wanting to get on the epic games launcher haha"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,oh i totally agree i really loved it despite some flaws and want to get my hands on a physical copy. im a fan of the alien movies so the h.r. geiger esque environment was awesome too
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"im 20, so i played halo 4 when i was like 12"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"haha, it's so bad it's good though. i may be a raccoon because i unironically love trash. xd"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,im not dming you my schedule thatd be weird haha
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"for some reason i was never able to finish dead space. i think i was near the end though when i put it down. i was terrified to start playing it and once i did, it wasnt too scary to wield a gun. kind of hard to get back in so i might have to restart it since its been awhile"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,i hope you like it!

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"ah man i beat laso reach a few months ago and it changed the whole feel of the game. honestly stopped feeling like halo and felt more akin to a puzzle game, figuring out the best paths to take. fun experience overall imo lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"i liked that it turned out to be a more human story rather than some scifigovernment conspiracy. before i played it, i wasn't really into walking sims but ended up absolutely loving it. i've replayed it a couple of times as it's like rewatching a favourite movie."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-12,"holy, yeah for 5 that's amazing. it's only about 5 hours of gameplay, but it's a beautiful 5 hours."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"loved code veronica as well. i played it on my brother's dreamcast, but i wasn't able to finish it. disk 2 was damaged and unreadable. i ended up playing disk one over and over to a point where i could reach the end of disk 1 which, iirc is when they ride a speed boat? in 3hrs, including cut scenes."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-11,"sort of i think? i need a certain number of credit hours outside of the business school to graduate and that includes a sciences class. not super outlandish here but probably depends on your university. im a sophmore and im already pretty much hitting all those requirements, so for junior and senior year my classes will be more focused with no random stragglers."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-21,"its a beautiful game, but storywise and game mechanicwise i found it to be very generic. a few great moments alongside a lot of pushing box puzzles and waiting for enemies to turn around stealth sections. and it didnt really come together in a satisfying or shocking way like the best of the genre. but the artwork is fantastic. i gave it a 610."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-12-21,"i almost disliked it because i played inside already. planet of lana doesn't add much new ideas to the genre and the execution and atmosphere is wayyy better in inside, still the goat of cinematic platformer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"my plan to sort this mess out would be something along these lines its been a while since ive played civ 2 but i can remember some stuff  forget ending the war, try and get your front line such that you can consistently withstand attack, forcing a stalemate. basically stop wasting production on tanks and planes that are going to get nuked anyway.  change to fundamentalism, i remember this was bad for research but you dont need it now anyway, but the people will stop hating you and you'll have more coin.  get your core cities to rebuild and fix the land surrounding them very costly in engineers, in know and get farms and production moving! im guessing it take a lot of turns to build a tank in a low population city.  once all thats in place, build an army of tanks, mountain troops, artillery and spys the like of which has never been seen and keep it off the frontlines, build rail roads as far as they'll go without losing engineers.  once all is in place, get spys in every enemy city enough to guarantee a nuke hit all the way to their capital, hit em all at once and drop in the mountain boys, wait for the nuke response, hopefully using their whole stockpile, then move your conventional army in and mop up the mess.  repeat with the other guys. diplomacy's failed in this world, youve got to hit em hard and take over the world for the greater good. then you can spend turn upon turn under the blanket of enforced religious peace fixing it with hundreds of engineers if you like! its for the greater good."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"first off awesome game man! i'm almost hesitant to give you advice on how to finish this one because it sounds like a truly epic struggle. also as many have already commented, the parallels between your game and 1984 are really remarkable. you should save this game in honor of orwell's foresight  now how to finish this game the best way to conquer your enemies in civ that i've always found anyways is to build a few super production cities and then mass up an insane army the kind that takes 20mins just to move. so to begin with choose a few core cities that are usually safe from attack. make the rest of your crappy outer cities build 1 engineer each and send them to beef up the land around your cores. 2. once your cores are primed and ready for production 20 shields production per turn...minimum!!! change the terrain to mountains and mine those suckers if you have to  start pumping out units. you're going to want to focus on tanks and howitzers and mechanized infantry. howitzers to pummel any defense your opponent has in his cities, tanks to kill weaker units in the surrounding hills and mech infantry to defend them once captured. 3. this strategy revolves entirely on a few massive pushes  think dday normandy kind of scale. ideally, you shouldn't even launch the attack until you are confident that the army you have is enough to defeat every single enemy unit. good luck!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"it seemed like just another day in this neverending war. the last few historians left who needs history now, really agree that it has been going on for at least 1500 years, but their estimates vary. why does it matter, anyway. the leaders of the remaining superpowers are locked in this pointless struggle, with no breakthrough. i have no idea how the vikings keep being so consistent over such a long time, but the communists have had the same family and principles in power ever since the war began and over here in america we've hooked up our president to a computer so he could rule forever. what a brilliant plan that was... each nation is powerful just enough so neither can fall. every time a city is captured, it is taken the next day. when roads are build in order to help dry up the swamps, they are immediately destroyed. the only way to rebuild our earth is for someone to win, but that won't happen. at least, that's what i thought until now. our forces took another city by dawn. nothing was special about it, apart from the fact that it was the first time it has been under american control since the war began. it's not that it was heavily guarded, only it was never deemed important enough for capture. as a part of our new military strategy, we had to capture it for the slight chance that an inhabitant over there could have any sort of solution to the famines. we didn't find a man, but we got the solution alright. i was being escorted into a large house on the outskirts of the city. it was a big, empty mansion, abandoned for generations according to the locals, who think it is haunted and avoid coming near it. nevertheless, we had to comb the entire town, so someone had to go there. i, a fragile and valuable scientists sent to the front lines to find some way to grow food in the irradiated swamps that make up most of the world now, am accompanied by a small squad to keep me guard against any sort of dangers. they aren't very smart to be fair, most of the smart people left in this world aren't anywhere near combat but they provide good company. as we enter the mansion i order them to split up and search the house. if they are to see anything unusual  they are to report it immidiately. all protocol, we have done it a hundred times in the past year alone, and yet i always excited by the fact that i am giving orders to these armed men. an hour passes and we find nothing, apart from a sprawling library in the basement. while we should move forward to more important targets, the idea of so many books untouched for such a long time intrigues me, along with my guards. we decide to call in a code 4057, which means we found something of interest and will be taking out time exploring it. we didn't expect finding much from the books, but it is a good distraction from the situation outside. the library is beautiful, modeled after the old ones that were in medieval castles. my guards all pick up some fiction books and start reading to their enjoyment, which surprises me as i never saw them take leisure in books. i go around the bookshelves, searching for something more interesting than mere stories, when an odd book strikes my eyes. it is labeled the secrets of life, without an author. the cover is colored with a strong crimson color and gold linings, and it is huge, at least 3000 large pages. i don't know what prompted me to pick it up, the fact that it could be what we're actually looking for or the amazing aesthetics of its cover, but the moment i lift it up from the bookshelf a loud, rumbling sound is heard. all of the guards spring to their feet, clinching their rifles reflexively, and turn to me. the bookshelf in front of me starts to turn, introducing a new, secret tunnel that is unlike anything i've seen before. even though this was probably built thousands of years ago, the hidden tunnel looks like it's from the future. it is a shiny, chrome color with lightblue wires running along the ceiling. we slowly make our way deeper into the ground, when a huge door comes in front of us. i walk to a control panel nearby and pull a biglooking lever, the only intractable object i can see, and the door begins to open slowly sideways, into the wall. behind it lies a large chamber, empty apart from a huge machine connected to the wires we saw before. the machine is just a cube, around 5 meters a side, with a large screen on the edge towards the door. as i approach it, a keyboard comes out of the cube and the screen turns on."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"try the 1700 year war. the three remaining nations have been locked in an eternal death struggle for almost 2000 years. peace seems to be impossible. every time a cease fire is signed, the vikings will surprise attack me or the americans the very next turn, often with nuclear weapons. even when the u.n forces a peace treaty. so i can only assume that peace will come only when they're wiped out. it is this that perpetuates the war ad infinitum. read this as the americans and the vikings have all but exhausted the resources of a world in their struggle for domination. both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on a ravaged planet, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. this is a fight to the death. for each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-09-13,"thanks for sharing your civ ii gaming experience. i am a long time player of civ ii, while i've tried civs 3, 4 and 5  i find civ ii to be the best. i downloaded your saved game and in two nights of play, i was able to get things turned around in your favour. here are my tips beginning the game i am the celtic nation americans are strong and they are my ally vikings are strong and an enemy incas are weak and also an enemy goal 1 dont piss off the americans your ally as i see a two front war as suicidal.  dont totally wipe out the incas, let them keep at least one city and then make peace.  dont make peace with the vikings when the americans your ally are at war with them.  halt the use of any existing nuclear weapons 2 attack the vikings in a nonnuclear, nonconventional method i call funding the insurgents  we will require gold to fund the insurgents, spies to deliver the gold and transports to deliver the spies.  switch your government to fundamentalism to keep your people from rioting and causing a civil disturbance, it also helps your cash flow  required to fund the insurgents who are the pissed off viking people.  stop all production of nuclear weapons, city improvements, have all your cities make armor. funding the insurgents  step 1  rattle the cage  begin building transports in costal cities like hieraconpolis that are close to the vikings as well as spies in any cities connected by railroads to those coastal cities.  with a spy in a transport and a couple thousand gold, look for small cities like trondheim. it all must happen in one move, your spy should go directly to the city from the transport. select the bottom option  incite a revolt  take advantage of the viking railroad system to first cause revolts in cities furthest away. this is important as viking units will take to the surrounding city areas  we dont want to block any future spy movement.  once you take over a city sell one of the improvements to recoup your coup d'tat expenses. the more money you get the better, the more useless the improvement the better. every turn you hold on to the city repeat the improvement selling.  the vikings will be successful in liberating some of their cities. they will fill them full of new troops to defend the city. feel free to incite a revolt once again, and now those troop are yours.  eventually the vikings will begin running low on troops to liberate their cities and they will change their government to a democracy. you cannot incite a revolt in a civilization with this type of government in this game. this completes the first step of the viking down fall. attack the viking capitals step 2  chase his government  the vikings cannot maintain a democracy for very long, its just too expensive and their people are going to begin rioting. theyve still got a lot of fight in them, but this is the beginning of the end.  you could make peace with them, but dont. it will piss off the americans who are your ally and still at war with the vikings and you cannot afford a war on two fronts. the vikings cant be trusted sooner or later they will knife you in the back, they best solution is to conquer them.  save your gold and try your best to hold on to as many viking cities as possible.  continue to sell the unless city improvements, you should also consider doing this in your preexisting cities too.  put together a conventional army of heavy tanks, use them to attack the viking capital city. after you capture it the vikings instantly move their capital, chase their government and attack the new capital. always try to avoid attacking viking units unless unavailable  as each viking unit outside a city make another citizen unhappy and unproductive.  in the year 4011 the viking civilization was destroyed by the celts, we have 20,180,000 people and 2,576 gold.  somewhere along the way i took over 3 of the 4 inca cities and made peace with them. reaching for space step  rebuilding the earth  many of the cities make a huge number of shields but have a small population, i decided to start the space race and i built a complete spaceship and it arrived at alpha century in the year 4046.  for the cities with enough wheat i built new settlers, we are very slowly changing the land back to pastures, i automate them all as i dont like to micromanage.  i stayed allied to the americans thought the game and the inca and i have never broken our peace treaty. while i have many spys at the ready and attack plans drawn up, i will not initiate war on my peaceful neighbours as i dont play that way."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"life long civ 2 player here. here's what you do switch to fundamentalism. stop attacking so that your enemies can rebuild their infrastructure. build a city close to your front line and buy an sdi first. this will protect your front line units from being nuked. sell your librariesuniversitiesresearch labs once this is done, switch all your cities over to rebuilding in this order temple granary engineer colosseum marketplace cathedral harbor engineer stock exchange factorymanufacturingrecyclingsolar military walls, baracks, etc. once you've rebuilt all your cities, begin manufacturing howitzers only. send all of these to one city. preferably the city closest to the nearest enemy. hopefully, this city is within 67 spaces of the target enemy city. once you have 100 howitzers, build an equal amount of transports, in the same city. once you have enough transports, bring in all your engineers. next turn, land on your enemy's city, bring in all howitzers and engineers. take over his entire land mass in one turn to prevent counter attack. if he has multiple land masses, land on all of them at once. the benefit of not attacking him will be that they have begun laying down roads that your engineers 5060 will be able to build on to ease the howitzers across cities. a good rule of thumb is 10 howitzers per city. good luck and spaghetti monster speed edit formatting edit here's another tip, let each city build for one turn so it pops on some shields. then buy whatever you're building. this reduces the price by half, increases your output by city and should reduce the time it takes to get up to a full army."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"this is amazing! you've created a really interesting world. i really like this part of your post i wanted to stay a democracy, but the senate would always overrule me when i wanted to declare war before the vikings did. this would delay my attack and render my turn and often my plans useless. and of course the vikings would then break the cease fire like clockwork the very next turn.... i was forced to do away with democracy roughly a thousand years ago because it was endangering my empire. but of course the people hate me now and every few years since then, there are massive guerrilla late game barbarians uprisings in the heart of my empire that i have to deal with which saps resources from the war effort. i love that your enemies forced you to play their game. that you tried to remain true to your ideals, but the situation forced you to be brutal. i imagine something like when caesar took over the roman empire. the initial idea is that you'll go authoritarian just for a little while, just until the war ends. but here you are 1 000 years later. the war is no closer to being over and your people are no closer to being free. the war has taken more than your cities it's ta i'd like to thank you sir. this is probably one of the most interesting things i've ever seen on rgaming. i gave you my upvote but somehow it doesn't seem like enough."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"man, this is worse then 1984. it's like this take 1984, get in some wh40k grimdark, and fallout of course, and combine those. now, put this cocktail in a microwave oven for an hour and you get this game. or, as a possible war scene would be there were nothing stopping those celts, dressed in varying shades of green, from attacking his hometown, wounded knee, it seemed. wave after wave of enemy infantrymen, tanks and helis approached the city like a massive starved beast looking to feast on some wellneeded food. it was the offensive tactic that he had seen in so many campaigns  humanity's goverments no longer saw men as men, only as tools for the war. he and his fellow american comrades, all what he saw as believing and true christians, were ready to defend as the soldiers commanded shouted over the rusty megaphone fire the artillery, now! he soon heard thunderous noises emitting from the inside of the small city as artillery shell after artillery shell fired from the pachtton cannons hit the advancing wave. not that it stopped the celts one bit as the wave came closer to the city. he had been fighting in this war since he was a child, due to official american policy. he was a veteran of similar charges, so the thoughts running in his mind were that if he survived, he would fight another day for america, the president and god. if he died, he would go to heaven. nothing would stop him from killing in the name of defending his hometown. the celtic mass soon enough, not disturbed by the artillery barrages clashed with the american defense, and it was all mantoman. it was all knifetoknife, guntogun combat as neither side were willing to use heavier weaponry. only the holy order of american engineers and similar orders in viking and celt lands knew how to build houses anymore, and no one was willing to destroy what few available resources were left  good trees were scarce, after all. as he slashed and shot his way against his celtic opponents, something hit him. undettered, he kept fighting on, despite the gaping wound in his left knee. amongst this carnage, there was nothing stopping him. almost all of his forefathers had fought in the war in ages past, why should he stop? and just as he was back on his feet, he was shot in the neck. a friendly fire  as the soldier collapsed and died, still clutching his knife and rifle. no one would remember his name as the battle for wounded knee continued to rage. official american accounts would not list the casualities from friendly fire. and in this world, as the war continues, humanity's hopes are all long gone, claimed by the swamps and the wastelands. the goverments are on the brink of disaster, food for the day for ordinary humans are something that only dreams can conjure, and the golden age of technology are now just a very distant memory. this world has now gone so far that official american christianity has intentionally confused the legendary general patton with jesus christ. if the war ever ends, no one will see it as a peace. the population of the world will only see it as a declaration of war against the war."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"you've mentioned you have sdi in place, you have the max techs on all sides. in games i've played in the past i've focused forces entirely into tanks and stealth fighters supported by spies on land, and built carrier groups with helo's and stealth fighters on deck with aegis escorts and a few transports filled with spies and tanks to follow. every turn you have to run fighters out in all directions to subspy hunt. if you can use spies to bribe any incoming spiesunits of note you can use spies from transports to do this to enemy ships, just get the transport by the ship and activate the spy. i also use spies on barbarian uprisings to bolster city units quickly. i also disband those barbarian units to speed up tankplane production. in your core cities you should be able to move your bribed troops fairly quickly over rail and be sure to set their home city to keep the people happy if you don't disband them into more advanced units. your coastal cities should be you're largest producers because they are harder to pollute and easier to clean. in a scenario like this one i would throw all i have at one enemy capital at a time. if i remember large empires in civ have a chance to splitting into civil war creating two enemies but weakening the greater one. in turn you may gain an ally in the fight. if you have sdi in place the perimeter of your cities should be defensible under it's shield. since you are using primarily tanks 3 moves per turn you can kill rail between your outer fringe cities and your core inner cities. focus on getting the core cities back up to full, happy citizens set your luxuries at about 30 take science down to 0 since it's a waste of funds and put the remainder into the remaining production bracket. you can always bump luxuries up to 40 if needed, happy people are productive ones. i always push for democracy if possible, spies are less effective against you. on your outer fringes make sure only roads lead into your areas, and forests around them if you can terraform, this forces spies to use up their moves just getting to you and you can expel them back to their capital using helo patrols. you basically need to limit their ability to access your core heartland and rebuild your main cities. if you can get democracy up and running and get get the money flowing in big, use spies to bribe enemy spies that approach and use those spies to subvert smaller cities. if you have the pyramids, sell your granaries and also sell the granaries of any city you subvert or conquer. if you don't have the pyramids, you need to capture that city if the wonder still exists. the key basic structures in any captured city should be sdi, walls, and airport. once you have an airport use it to fly tanks 1 turn at a time into the city to bolster it. also part 45 stealth fighters in the city to run patrols for spy hunting. after that focus on building it's people needs, use the other cities to supply troops via air and or rail if you build it. if you build proper defenses, you are fine if the enemy attacks first, if anything it forces them to over extend. if you run vigilant air patrols and keep your cities properly buffered and keep units in the cities. stealth fighters are powerful and expendable, use them on a defense until they crash or are shot down. you can kill 34 more units per unit if you don't fly them home again. another trick i used to use when capturing cities is to use spies to subvert the the partisan units and pull them into the city defense freeing up my tank to roll further while also approaching for peace. never declare war, let them attack you, they will always offer peace and buy you time after they lose enough. never leave a stack of units on an open square always park them on hills and preferably into fortresses. use engineers to lead the way when possible. if you're lucky you capture the city with sdi intact, if so park as many units as you can in that city until you can prep the next attack. still going for the capital with a carrier group and helo's is usually the primary strike. since you will probably lose the units in battle or to nukes anyways, i will usually send my stealth fighters on 1 way trips, they attack until they crash or are shot down. believe it or not it actually bolsters morale since that city is no longer supporting a unit far from home. seems like i was able to stack somewhere close to 20 units on a carrier back when i played, and sometimes would use two carrier strike forces, usually on opposite coasts so i could fly over and still have a friendly deck to land on if for some reason i was not kamakazing them. so there you have it. build up your core, build large attack groups, focus on core power units, rule the air and strike at your opponent's heart and pray for a civil war. push for democracy and they will not be able to outproduce your industry. keep people happy and use luxuries as much as you can to keep them happy. also micro manage your cities along those lines as well, up taxes just enough and setup entertainers elvito keep your people rocking. and be very vigilant of your borders, do not give your enemy a rail line in and expel any spies spotted from the air before they can get close enough to plant a nuke. i will download the game when i get in from work and see if i can pull it off as well. this late in the game a usual turn may take an evening to execute"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is bliss
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i posted this before on reddit i think but let me tell you the best game of civ 4 i ever had or a small time frame of it. sorry for wall of text and you will probably not understand half of it unless you play civ. also forgive my spelling grammar i kinda got tired and was just free rolling from memory it was an epic game though. the year is not really that important because civ games technological rates are dependent on many things. technically speaking we are probably in the 1960's. no one has stealth tech yet. there are 3 super powers sharing a continent. one 3rd world nation holding a continent to its self zulu and 2 other civs that lag behind on tech sharing another content aztecs and egyptians . celts myself a democratic state with free religion holding 14 on the far left side of the northern continent. it is also the homeland of the worlds most popular religion judaism my state was previously a theocracy but due to united nations vote i was encouraged to intact free religion. my military is arguably the most powerful i have more nuclear weapons than the russians and i can also hit there city using attacks from submarines. my navy is second to none. my army is however much smaller than the russians. i border a similar sized nation of similar wealth and technology america. they control the united nations through election but i house it in my second city. the americans are the 3rd most powerful nation with a military half the sized of myself, they do not have nuclear weapons but are capable of producing them. they are also democracy with all the most liberal options and it was there first vote at un that made me drop my theocracy. to the americans right are the russians who's country is slightly bigger than both american and celtsme land. they are communist police state. they are pretty much communist russia massive yet backwards. they have a massive regular army which they love placing all along the american border. massive air force which they waste countless minutes to recon over america every turn and also nuclear weapons. all three super powers have fought in the past before nuclear weapons but since the modern era things have been peacefull with well established borders. the americans are friendly to me and the russians but have an open border with myself and a defence pack. 90 of my army is stationed along the russianamerica border and 90 of my airforce is based in american cities too defend them encase russia attacks. it is clear that a war between me and the russians would be armageddon with neither side going to achieve anything kinda like op's situation. it is too late for religious victory so my only options are space race or diplomatic victory because even taking the other civs lands would not give me land area or population victory because russia is too big. i decide to win by un vote even though i don't control the council i have the perfect plan to do so. i know russia will never vote for me and will always vote for itself like wise i will do the same for voting for myself but i know america and the other civs could be bought. so i start getting sweet with america accepting there trades with out bartering for better deals. i give my extra shitty food resources to the zulu and bring them up to the industrial age in technology which wins them over. i do the same for both the egyptians and the aztecs. i get voted into the un and my first vote is to elect me as winner but sadly i do not get enough votes with pretty much every one abstaining except me and the russians. i think no biggy lets just wait till these gifts start swaying them and i'll use my un votes to force resolutions that bring us together, freedom of speech ect. which the russians defy which is good because it makes peeps hate them including america. so i decide to change the other civs views by asking them and gifting them shit when they do which works. so we all have the same types of liberalish governments. so roll on my vote ''yeah i'm gonna win'' everyone votes for me except the freaking aztec wtf. worse still the aztec declare war and invade egypt that turn, wtf again. so i decide to send a ''peace keeping'' force to egypt and capture some aztec city's until they surrender. my advanced navy and marines make mince meat of the aztec army, establishing air bases in egypt to bomb the crap out of the aztec my marines quickly destroy all aztec resistance they surrender and become a vassal state. roll on next election ''for sure its in the bag'' everyone votes for me except russia naturaly and the freaking aztec! wtf wtf i fucking own you shits. worse still i can't wipe them out they have surrendered it's just not possible, you can't undo the vassal unless they choose to. so i'm like ahh games bugged dev error or someshit no way to win but then i realise i can win i simply need to delegitimise there nation and create my own from there citys. so i form plan israel. no fucking joke i decide that to win i must make israel who will of course support my un vote i decide to make my new nation from captured aztec cities renaming them tel aviv, jerusalem ect. i even convert them to judaism because i still gt gold for every jewish city. i provide israel with everything it could desire i giver her 200 gold each turn i built loads of buildings in the city before i founded the state. my plan is that israel will declare war on the aztec and wipe them out giving me the un majority that i need israel is voting in support of me at the un. slowly israel is taking over the aztec cities through cultural absorption. i keep giving the israeli cash to build cultural achievements. i also demand every single piece of resource crap the aztecs have knowing fine well that if they refuse the vassal state contract will be broken and i can bomb them to shit. i also discover that i can put large amounts of coin into sabotage against them and send like 30 spies to destroy every road, farm, building they have. finally the israeli declare war against them but they are fucking useless and even manage to lose a city to the aztec, wtf i gave you advanced military and you fail hard you dam cowards! after somehow losing a 3 turn war the israeli make peace with the aztec but then shortly after anoter wave of me now sending spies to destroy anything of value in the captured israeli city the aztecs break the vassal contract i march in wipe them out giving all there city to israel. israel who loves me ''10 you granted us our independence and gave us citys'' all the while egyp looks on not giving a shit so funny. well anyway on the next un vote i won. in short to win at civ i had to become evil and support a rouge state as it wipes out another. best game of civ i've ever had."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,1984 anyone?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i have been playing civ 2 ever since it was released. i agree that you need to consolidate a core few cities and fix them with engineers. the outer cities are a buffer zone for the war. go on a defensive, let the vikings expend energy attacking while you build up the revenge. but you have two main problems 1. most of the pollution is in viking controlled teritory. it is possible to stop the global warming but you have to clear up all the pollution including that inside enemy territory. 2. your supply lines are really really long. your army has to move too far from your main cities to where your enemy is. including bad ocean crossings where the army ends up sat on the shore for a while. these two problems are wrapped in to one. sort out the supply lines and you will be able to conquer the vikings and clean up the pollution. and then everything else is much easier. to do this you need to sort a few things out. 1. build coastal cities to move your army using transports between continents seamlessly. no military unit should ever be left outside a city or sdi defense is gone and they will get nuked or otherwise destroyed. particularly you need a city north of edinborough near thebes. build it 3 squares north of edinborough, that way any sdi defense in edinborough will protect the new city and it can't be nuked on being built. critically it is also within 7 sea squares of thebes so you can move units across in one turn. that is the big whole in your supply line and will allow you to strike quickly at the core viking cities. 2. get rid of all bombers, nukes, military ships etc they are too expensive and not effective enough. build only howitzers, mech inf, transports, and engineers. they are the cheapest units and are also the most effective when used properly. howitzers destroy cities, mech inf defend them, transports and engineers get the attack units to cities instantly. 3. build an enormous store of howitzers and mech inf and have them primed and ready to go. hiding behind an inpentrable defense way away from the front line. then when ready 100 howitzers, 100 mech inf or so and enough transports c.25 to move them to cities linked with railroads to the enemy in one turn then you strike. and you take all of the major enemy cities in one turn. also presumably you know that leaving a spy in a city is defense against spies planting nuclear devices. so you should have one in each of your cities alongside the usual sdi, city wall, coastal frotress, sam battery defense. oh yeah and you should definitely be in fundamentalism until this is sorted. communism just won't cut it. once you have extra cash you can start bribing enemy cities to convert using a small army of spies too. it will help mop up the outlying cities that are difficult to get a full army to. hope this helps"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,it scares me how unrealistically realistic this is.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"first of all kudos. its been ten years since i've last played civ2. i loved that game. thank you for bringing up those memories! now you've already read some good advice  switch to fundamentalism  concentrate engineering power where enemies can'tunlikly will damage your investment  if you cant do the latter, concentrate strategic effort on making this possible i'd like to ad the following.. martyr cites if you feel like your engineers work is beeing wasted you should consider building new cities on neuralgic points like sea gates, isthmus, train tracks, mountains, directly on enemy resources etc. and back those settlers up with enough military so those cities become hard to enter and drain enemic resources. new settlements or you could check for unused landressources in your heartland and make it usable by building a city nearby, which would add to your production also  and this is half blurred 10yr old memory half internet research... build bridges another user mentioned terraforming land into ocean. i am not sure if i did that back then. but i am pretty sure that i had railroads on water. my internet research piled up something, that i remember doing. so i either unconciously making this up or might add a new strategic weapon to your arsenal building railtracks on water. if you put a unit on a transportship it turns into sleep mode. this is the same thing a rocket does if you put it on a plane. you could, at all times wake up such a unit from its sleep. so i remember waking up engineers on the ocean and commanding them to build a road. i really hope i am not making this up. can anyone verify on the oceanroad thing? i've found this old cheat list httpwww.civfanatics.comciv2cheats"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,global warming? dwindling population suffering from famine? permawar with nukes and guerilla revolts against the communist regime? spies setting off bombs in the cities? a massive swamp world devoid of most life? this would make for an amazing book.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"i played a scenario one time that started with a single settler on a earth map, which has a pollution in every square. if i remember correctly, tundra does not turn into swamp, so that is where you want to settle, preferably coastal cities, since sea tiles still yield 2 food, 2 trade and 1 shield, even if the earth warms up a million times. that should give a massive production bonus over all size 1 and 2 inland cities. furthermore, to stem the flood of tanks, switch to fundamentalism, start cracking out mechs and maybe some fanatics create a defensive perimeter around your cities with swamp or mountain forts, close enough to the sdi's to prevent them from being nuked, and make sure that the defensive line is closed, so no spy can get through. ai's usually will send everything they have against your line, but breaking through with tanks vs. swamp fort mech's shouldnt happen. the tithes from funda should bring on some nice extra cash for now. so then you will get time to work on a plan to finish the game. it depends on what you want to do. if you want to crush the opposition, build up your industry again, and start churning out stealth bombers, howitzers etc. until youre ready to blitz the enemy. if you want to restore the planet and return to peace stop nuking with spies, it gives 99 attitude and i think 7  max reputationloss, giving despicable rep, so it keeps the ai's at enraged level, making peace impossible. if you do that, and stop sneak attacking, just keeping bottled up behind your defensive line, peace should be possible again, in say 200 turns or so until your rep gets back to 3 i guess. in the mean time, start cleaning up pollution farming is useless until you can stop global warming from happening every few turns. it depends a lot of the ai cleaned up its territory a bit, but i guess not if you constantly nuked them. if you stop, they should start doing that, if you attain peace with them, you can start helping them and you can start farming again, etc. etc."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,simply put there is no hope fore peace due to the massive amounts of nuclear attacks so you need to crush your enemies. i don't know the size of the map but if it is a larger map let them get into your territory with a stack of doom. then nuke the stack of doom. because they are in your territory they won't heal as fast making it easier for you to destroy the stack of doom. again being in your territory he also won't be able to reinforce his stack. after that you need to assess the situation can you counter attack did you destroy enough of his units to take a city? or maybe just enough to raze on? or use the time to build up a larger stack of doom to use later. but try to stay defensive keeping your stacks out of site and away from boarders so they are harder to nuke. it is a war of attrition so conserve your troops and only attack when you know you can win. destroying a city hurts his production giving you and edge in number of troops eventually allowing you to actually keep some of the cities giving you a production edge over the third guy. another very risky strategy is to give away cities to one enemy so you only have a front against that one enemy allowing you to take some of his cities in another area. this is very dependent though on how the map looks.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,wwed what would ender do
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"just the fact that this is a 10 year old match is pretty neat, but finding other people so passionate and willing to try and save this fictional world is giving me goosebumps."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"the same scenario happened to me but on an adjusted ww2 map. i removed the turn limits since 4 years was not enough and i made spain a playable character me. i was making ground and made a spearshield army. shieldmobile infantry, spearhowitzers. i only had a few tanks just for pillaging raids and to eliminate weakened defeated soldiers. i had conquored france and most of north africa. i was doing well with one exception russia. if anyone had ever played this map before, you know, once russia builds railroads to connect her empire, the game is almost done. with rods you get a few turns delay for resupply, enough to make ground, but with near instant transport with so many cities, they can spam you to death with guerrillas. i was at war with everyone and germany was easy enough to destroy but they were my buffer against russia. so, i devised a plan and it is to this day my best war stratagy i ever came up with. i made peace with england. i needed the seas and i couldn't do so with constant air attack from the island. and i made transports. lots and lots of transports. and, to cover the stacks, three battleships and the aegis crusiers. i made three navy stacks and loaded my entirer army into them and sailed to the baltic. once i got there, i lost one stack to a nuke. most of the army survived and in just one turn after landing, i cut a swath of destruction strait to moscow and took it, then my whole army was wiped out next turn. i had won though. when you take a capital in some scenarios, civil war can break out and from where there was one nation, there are now two locked into a permanent war, at least, i think its permanent, i never saw them peace. russia split. now china was on the map and russian and it are nuking the bejeezus out of each other. germany is making ground in the east and england dropped the treaty with me and is bombing paris. i am losing italy to germany and have already lost amsterdam. i have no army so i am stalling until i can rebuild. then comes global warming. what follows was 100 turns of hell. just like in your scenario, everything turns to swamp. i manage to keep a few roads out of spain but for the most part, my europe holdings are lost. england and i do well since we have a majority of ocean cities. i go communist, just like you, so does england. the mainland empires go theocratic. i still have my mediterranean holdings and they help my cities survive the fundy unit onslaught. i have no idea the battle raging in the east but i think china is winning since they have only one war front. with all roads protected with a dedicated mobile infantry unit on every road plot, i can bring in howitzers. without roads, i falter. it ends in a stalemate. i didn't play it for 10 years, but honestly man, thinking back, i wish i did. kudos to you man. i haven't thought about this great game in awhile."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"a few main tips for what i did in lategame war build rail. it takes i think 8 engineers to built railroad in a square in one turn. if the square has no roads, that's ten engineers. use the rail to drive artillery. use only one of the artillery's moves in attack each turn. take it home to a safe city after the one attack. you'll find a sweet spot city without sdi that's close to another that has sdi. this sweet spot, let's call it bait is what the enemy will try to nuke. place enough units in there to lure the nukes. utilize the artillery to soften a city. if you can't take it in one turn don't. when you capture the city, don't garrison it with very many units unless it has sdi. it could end up as your new bait city. every turn, your priority should be to kill any enemy units in the field. artillery is your friend. but keep the artillery on the rails. period. after the enemies in the field are dead, soften cities. there will be friendly cities that they know they can't nuke sdi and are heavily garrisoned. let them break their teeth on these cities. punish the survivors with your artillery. don't leave your own toys out in the yard to be stepped on. patience, and railroads."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"first of all this is great, but it looks unwinnable. its been a while since i've played civ 2 but here's what i'd try first switch to fundamentalism and start spamming fanatics everywhere. you'll want to focus on getting the americans off your continent, so create walls of fanatics around cyre and north of timbet for them to waste turns destroying while you switch over a couple of your larger cities, or higher production cities, to create loads of spies. keep your fanatics replenished. once you have a large enough spy army infiltrate nuke all of their cities on that continent in a single turn. move around the rail network and capture them all with one unit. if you have enough fanatics left, move them around pillaging all of your own railways near your south coast. they'll probably win half or more of the cities back on the next turn so repeat build your spy army. if by some miracle this works and the continent is yours, quickly build a couple of transports in chicago, kansas city and tintagel, then enough paratroopers to capture the island in a single turn. another spy army and paradrop in destroying the hated american civ. similar strategy for the vikings, but you'll now have a production advantage over them."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,someone should write a dystopian story about this and name it the hunger games...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,thanks for posting this. this was super neat and interesting as well as frightening and amusing. please let us know if the vikings ever fall.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,is it possible to form just a treaty with the americans to team up against the vikings? also is it possible to slowly replace the senate members in some way to ones who would be more on your side? what is a little disturbing is how much this could be a future example of real life considering how governments are acting lately.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"here's what you need to do. build aegis cruisers. like 10 of them in one turn if possible. if you can't build lots in one turn, move them to a coastal city that is safe from spies while you build up this stockpile. then build a stealth bomber and an aircraft carrier. put the aircraft carrier underneath the aegis cruisers. take the entire stacked fleet out to sea. you can stack pretty much anything on top of this and it will be indestructible. put the stealth bomber on top to prevent nuclear attacks  only fighters can attack stealth bombers in civ ii . this will force your enemies to waste inordinate amounts of shields producing cruise missiles and fighter jets to hit this unstoppable force. it will be a cruisemissile attractorabsorber. they will even, due to an obscure bug, fly cruise missiles next to this stack fleet and end their turn without them crashing. shoot these down. gradually build up fully loaded troop transports with howitzers underneath this stack. it will take maybe 20 years, but eventually you will have a gigantic army. invade."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"donutef's plan would work well. however the time to build the engineers and reform your land would indeed be a little daunting. i have another suggestion. stage 1 you say that the stalemate exists because any conventional forces that make any progress get nuked right? so what you could do is make a chain of cities from your front line to wherever you want to attack first. found another city on the edge of an existing city, just within the protection of the sdi defence. then build only defence appropriate structures ie baracks, city wall and sdi defence. it will be more of a forward outpost or fortress rather than a functioning city. load it chalk full of mobile infantry and tanks etc. also maintain and move your frontline forward, idealy air tight so no spy's can sneak through and nuke your forward city. rinse and repeat. side note to attempt a sure chance that you will conquer a city, bulid one of these forts either right outside the boundry of an enemy city so your units can be sdi protected while being next to or close to an enemy city or even within an enemy cities borders though im not sure what sort of stance you have standing with your foes, if it is anything but war i think they will ask you to remove units from the vicinity and thus it wont be possible. stage 2 you will have to have build a rediculously large arsenal of howitzers at this point, i would say 100. once you have turtled your way to their front lines, start sending in the howitzers. it is imperetive that there be an unbroken railroad connection to your first target. howitzers have 2 actions possible per turn right? so simply send in a howitzer, use 1 action to attack, it will almost surely destroy the target its attacking, then retreat it back to the safety of the closest sdi defended position. rinse and repeat until you run out of howitzers. worst case scenario you destroy close to 100 enemy units without losing many howitzers. with enough repetitions you will out produce your enemy until you can consistently hold cities. side note when you conquer a city it seems a random amount of city improvements will be left behind, if the sdi defence is still standing you can make that your forward outpost, have 10 mech infantry ready to move in and defend and build a city wall and buy the completion that turn. im sure you've realised but disbanding a unit from within the city view, while it's in the city will give you 50 of the shields it cost to make. disbanding a useless unit, or at least an expendable one will vastly reduce the amount it costs to force complete a city improvement. continue until victory. i haven't played nearly as far into the future as you have but due to the cities being in ruins and the length of the conflict, the enemy army can't be so large so within 2 or 3 turns you should be able to just conquer half of their cities in 1 turn. depending on the production possibilities of your cities, reforming the land to increase production may be necessary to build the amount of units you would need. so donutef's strat would likely come into play. hope this is clear enough s and i just want to say this is an amazing post. im so going to dig up my old civii saves and check them out"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"the key will be to form an alliance with whatever other nation you've pissed off the least. give them money, buy them nice things, compliment their wardrobe. use this alliance to smite the remaining enemy, you can't count on your ally pitching in much until the enemy is weakened so try to save up units in cities and wait. when the time is ripe let out all your units from your cities, kind of like all those meddlesome midgets coming out from under that big ladies dress in the nutcracker. if you stagger your enemy that should be incentive for your ally to pitch in for garbage time two front war, yeeeah buddy. you can also try inciting revolts to weaken and then take cities or simply build new cities and buy sdi units asap simply to advance your line. oh and try to comitt a good amount of your forces to air units, their range will help you take out relief units behind the front line. i love this game, good luck and god speed. hopefully we'll see you on the other side comrad lycerius."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,i have an idea for a book.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i doubt if the people in this world even have any concept of peace anymore. the idea that the world could exist in anything other than a constant state of war and nightmarish suffering is probably as impossible to them as the idea of utopia is to us. there are probably cults that talk about how the war could end if everybody would simply stop fighting, or if one nation would sacrifice itself. it's probably accepted fact that beyond 25 the likelihood that you're still alive decreases dramatically. my advice would be to play the war out for a few more million years, until everyone develops evolutionary defenses against radiation."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"ok, you have two major issues that need to be resolved. first your land is useless. second you have aggressive untrustworthy neighbors with no compunction for using nukes. looking at your map i would say it's time to resettle some of your cities near whale resources which provide a lot of food and sheilds relative to anything else you have available and target enemy cities near mountains, hills and whales with nukes early and often when they declare war on you. this should limit the enemy ability to generate new military units while simultaneously boosting your ability to rebuild your civilization. secondly i would surround your most important cities with really junky units, partisans, riflemen whatever is cheapest this should hopefully minimize the amount of nuke planting that spies can do to your best cities. this will also give cover to your engineers as they clean up the space around the city and try to improve the terrain. i would simply pick one civilization that is the easiest for you to beat and simply attempt to wipe them off of the map. in your case that would be the americans fight only defensive wars against the other civilization until the first one is finished. at this point the only way to improve their diplomatic feeling towards you after so many treaty violations on both sides is to consistently fight one common enemy and to not declare war on them anymore. every time the vikings declare war on the americans, join in. every time the americans declare war on the vikings declare war on the americans. you have to find a way to shake up the dynamic so that hopefully you can come out with something like 60 of the eventually conquered american territory. i see you have what is a lot of gold, i would use that to buy a lot of engineers, paratroopers and the occasional transport vessel. indeed land forces are overrated. i would personally put a lot of effort into destroying every possible road that leads to you and the vikings. let them march through the swamp. this should slow up a lot of their armies and give you time to marshall your forces on the border if that is necessary to prevent an attack. focus your energies on bombers, paratroopers and alpine troops that can move quickly over roadless terrain and them make them attack you or take advantage of the tank's relative weakness on the defensive. you may lose a lot, but it will slow them down and open them up to a lot of pounding with your air power. you can often detain an invading army using this tactic and make your stronger enemies sue for peace. doing these things will hopefully simultaneously make the vikings more apt to like you and less effective in harming you while you gain strength and prepare to take enough territory from the americans and eventually the vikings to prevent global warming kicking in every so often. at this point the land can begin to heal and you can focus on building pollution decreasing improvements in your cities that are farther away from the front lines. the healing will begin. this will take a lot of time given the circumstances you have. the land may never heal, but you can get out of the eternal hell of perpetual war you are playing with."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i once played a game of civilization ii where i decided to see what would happen if you pushed global warming to the extreme. i polluted like crazy and then started multiple nuclear wars. with the fallout in my own territory, i ignored it until climate change occurred. again and again, pushed way beyond what the designers intended. i wanted to see how far it went. in the beginning, change was gradual  a square would turn from grasslands to plains, from plains to desert. i kept going. it didn't happen near the pollution  it was random. the rest of the world seethed, but could do nothing against my superior armies. eventually, the entire earth became swamp, the worst possible land terrain. farms and mines were sunk, and people starved. every city in the world fell to 10,000 population. armies were disbanded due to lack of food. wars stopped due to lack of armies. buildings were sold due to lack of taxes. a sea of swamp with tiny, powerless settlements dotting it here and there. the world had ended. but i cheated. i kept a slave laborer and fed them nothing. in civ2, you could capture enemy workers  and they wouldn't have a home city that had to support them. while i lost everything else, my one slave laborer sat waiting, until the last square became swamp. then i began to drain the swamps and make good farmland. my capital city began to rebuild itself. soon it was able to churn out more workers, and they cleared even more land. i rebuilt buildings, created an army, but did not attack. soon my people outnumbered the rest of the world a hundred to one, and rising. then i lost patience and took over the rest of the world with a single tank. but that's civilization for you."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-17,"damn, i really want to play some civ2 again now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-18,"this is actually quite astonishing. i mildly remember civ ii as the first civilization that i played when i was around 567 years old, maybe. therego i was too young to actually remember most of what the game had to offer.always been more of a civ iiiv, which are, in my opinion incredibly fun. but this might just get me to start playing civ ii again."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-24,"i have copped shit from all my friends for about 10 years for continuing to play civ ii, and this post has made my day. i have just downloaded the save file and started playing, and i reckon i can save this world, get rid of the other civs by subverting their cities, and get my population to at least 100 million  will keep you posted! first step was revolution to fundamentalism as many others have suggested, putting spies in each city, then pulling all units back into cities, building defensive city improvements and staving the vikings off long enough to clean up the pollution. casualties are low so far, and no cities have fallen. thanks heaps op! you have reinvigorated my gameplay!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-26,well i played the game file you posted. brought you to victory in 4047. if you want the file i can post it somewhere... future of humanity not so bleak after all d
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-07-07,wow lol keep up the fight! d
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-07-15,10 years in civ... i love your willpower
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-07-16,"well, most of these have been said in some way, shape or form, but here's a few ideas. 1. stabilise your cities with harbours and offshore platforms. guaranteed food and production regardless of global warming, live off the sea. 2. build engineers and clean up your mess they're useful for something. the ai players will clean theirs up and after a century or so the melting icecaps cease. know the rules. only pollution squares count for global warming and it takes 9 pollution squares or more to initiate it. even with more it takes a while. 3. sit and rebuild. the current fortress position is easily defended. you can easily kill any viking land units with half a dozen bombers while they waste their bombers on fruitless attacks on defended cities. if you stop attacking and they can't find an easy target, they'll give up on nukes. 4. sun tzu avoid war. if it is necessary, achieve your objectives quickly so you don't wear the population out. when you're ready, launch short sharp campaigns. clear the area with bombers, buy small cities and take the big ones with howitzers. the viking cities have many buildings, they will be essential to fight the americans so the less casualties the better. 5. sun tzu again understand yourself, understand your enemy. the vikings are aggressive, they will keep fighting so you will have to take them out first. the americans are expansionist, leave them alone and they will ally with you against the vikings, just don't let them get too powerful, or aim to outgrow them. 6. believe it or not, i actually recommend democracy as soon as the climate stabilises and you have a few engineers. democracy allows faster population growth. well, i'm not going to win in 58 years but here's a story of long term strategy the celts hold firm in hieracanopolis after a century of war and engineers clearing the pollution, they stabilise the planet a few daring raids and several viking cities fall in succession. they nuke one, but promptly lose it again. the fledgling celtic republic arises, slims down its army and rebuilds while just holding the line. a series of short campaigns then the vikings begin to request peace treaties, which they promptly break. the americans ally against the vikings. as the population grows, an army of engineers terraforms the celtic cities. the celts usher in democracy and become the most populous race. the americans wipe out the sioux and the last viking city while the celts conqure the viking heartland, utilising captured cities and military forces to accelerate their campaigns. the viking cities are a veritable industrial powerhouse and boost the power of the celts. and the real war begins.... the celts strike first and within a decade, more than a dozen american cities fall, including the old viking island. every city the sneaky american former allies built to infiltrate the celtic heartlands fell in the first year. the americans hit back hard with their superior military of over 500 units and the war lurches back and forth. damaging periods of revolution and battles are interspersed with peace to refill the coffers and patch up battleworn bombers and artillery. sensing they are losing the advantage, the americans retaliate deep into the celtic heartland island cities with a volley of nukes and slam the recently lost old viking cities in the northeast, temporarily halting the celtic campaign and restoring equilibrium. engineers swarm and the pollution clears. the celts diligently invest in sdi. the advantage shifts back and forth around ephesos and satsuma and the americans again resort to nukes to take the advantage. in the celtic and old viking heartlands, city after city hits its straps and turns to full military production, battleships and bombers roll off the production lines while mega cities support numerous units.... the celts make peace for a decade then boot the americans from the celtic motherland decisively with their new forces. the celts have not used nor built a single nuke, and the americans have depleted their arsenal. the war is slow and bitterly fought, but the tide is beginning to turn. the american navy swells, but the miltary has been halved by the war. the celtic army alone has outgrown the entire american military. the un ushers in a new uneasy peace. almost 100 celtic stealth bombers stand by to rain death from above, while a second carrier battle group gathers for a new offensive as the battleground shifts to a war between islands..... enjoy"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i have a game like this going on in civ 5 although i've only been playing it for four consecutive days. turn 800, playing epic on large map. three nations left plus me, which makes four. one of them japan is only down to one city and will lose it as soon as songhai grows a pair. the only problem is that america is bordered to the north of them and keeps hitting them. i, on the other hand, started on my own small australialike continent and then moved on to the other second mainland i'm playing continents where i destroyed the iroquois, the french, and the chinese. i've also settled the southeast asialike chain of semismall islandscontinents that surround americasonghaijapan. they're all at war with one another struggling to pump out armies to fight off invaders. in the mean time, i'm building up a massive invasion force consisting of mechanized infantry, modern armor, mobile sams, gunships, and rocket artillery. the precursor to landing the ground forces will be a small trio unit of a missile cruiser, a destroyer, and a battleship group that lead the first assault and to repel any attempts to get at my transports. oh, and each missile cruiser is loaded with nuclear missiles which will be the first strike. three nukes to each missile cruiser and there's eight, which makes 24 nuclear missiles. essentially i intend to wipe out all of their forces in one turn maybe even some of their cities and then launch the ships! before they can even really do anything. i predict i will win the game in 15 to 20 turns after the first strike."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"from the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism to understand the nature of the present war  for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war  one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. none of the three superstates could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. they are too evenly matched, and their natural defenses are too formidable. eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces. oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific, eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants. secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. with the establishment of selfcontained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. in any case each of the three superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. between the frontiers of the super states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier, brazzaville, darwin, and hong kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth. it is for the possession of these thicklypopulated regions, and of the northern icecap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area. portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"this is absolutly amazing to see someone having invested so much time in a civ ii game and it is even more crazy to see the result of it ! what difficulty are you playing on? my 3 cents switching to engineers is a risky move if you clean the fallout around a city and it gets nuked and captured by a paratrooper that's quite a waste... on the other hand some of your city must be difficult to reach even with the movement of a nuclear missile monte cristo could you be french p ?. i suggest clearing these first. switching to fundamentalism is definitly the best option for obvious economicproductionhappinness reasons you have rebels in your territory in one of the picture tanks are overrated, they are good, but in such a situation you want weapons to smash enemy's troop. make invasion groups with 12 marines to tank in the frontline they are great, cheap and can hold very well in 50jungle,forest,hills, 200fortress, 12 engineers to repair roads and connect annexed cities, 1 spy to buy offplant nuke, 23 tanks to get back the lost ground during enemies' turn and fortify in fortress and 68 artilleries to push. making 23 groups like that would allow you to get some cities in a few turns if they are not nuked. you obviously need to get some air force as well to get rid of these pesky bombers, if they kill you some units during their attack turn, you can wipe them out all in one turn with 34 fighters even if it means suicide for them. get nukes to strike some of the cities you target and at least one to answer theirs and a transport full of fanatics 44 very cheap units in case you get your annexed cities nuked, to freeze the front. fight for glory!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i want to try something like this with civ iii, but i'm shitty at it and need tips. no response so far from rtheeternalwar, so xposting it here. so i've played civ iii for years and it's the only one that could really hold my attention. but i never got good at the game maybe because i played in one or twomonth bursts every few months, maybe i'm just naturally bad at strategy games since i also fail at age of empires 2. so i've only ever played on the easiest setting with less aggressive ai. i haven't played in a while, but this post has made me interested again. i want to try a longterm game that goes into the future, far beyond the end of the main game. but if i play on a low difficulty it will likely just become me dominating everyone else like every other game of civ i've played. i want to get better and have a real game, but i don't know how. so reddit, tell me how i can improve in any way you can!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"considering how this has exploded all over the internet, i'm wondering if sid meier himself would be willing to hop into his conversation and offer his advice and thoughts."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"a few years ago i started playing advance wars on nintendo ds, i love tbs games and i thought if give aw a try. my god it was amazing, i played against the ai on the hardest mode after a few days of learning all the commands a huge map with tens of cities, 2 main continents of equal size with only 3 land bridges and surrounded by the sea. day by day i wrote a diary from the point of view of the heroic commander in chief. on the first day i was confined to about 34 cities while the enemy took his whole island and started conquering my continent. day 2 resulted in me taking control of my entire continent so i was more or less equal to the ai. for the next few days i was mostly on the defensive, defending my continent against the constant barrage of rocket artillery, ac130 fire and tanks, but on the 5th6th day, i lost the diary by accident, well it was on my phone, i made the first attack on enemy soil. i was on the offensive. i was damn proud of that!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,lets not forget that fundamentalism gives you access to fanatics which is a 20 production 44 unit which means even the worst city can produce one every turn. fundamentalism was always the best option in civ 2 after all the tech is done. with a great library and enough diplomacy you can get to future tech pretty fast.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"i was a hopeless civ iii addict for years multiplayer civ was like a god competition. i gladly put up with probably the worst multiplayer interface in the world. but i had an insane problem with people who would quit the game. eventually i had to stop playing games unless i could be host which meant deactivating all of the antivirus protection on my computer, which was just lovely, and then to stop playing games as soon as anyone quit without being eliminated. i was completely insane. they made an enormous mistake between the second and third civ iii expansion packs, from play the world to goldcomplete play the world allowed you to select the smallest possible world size tiny even with the maximum number of players 8, while goldcomplete limited tiny maps to 4 players and small maps to 6. even a small map was too large for a realtime multiplayer game, and on an ordinary normalsized map half of the players would quit before even a tenth of the map had been settled. the only way to try and get around this was to make the planet as young as possible, as watery as possible, and as hot as possible, to minimize the total amount of arable land. every map became a parched, mountainous desert wasteland, sometimes without even any fresh water to allow for irrigation, and you created these situations where mad max stone age armies were forced to fight it out for control of narrow box canyons and tiny slivers of flood plain. actually, when you did it that way, it was rather fun. anyway, civ ii was in some ways a much less complicated game. all of the civ ii games in which i survived to the industrial age ended in almost exactly the same way as has been suggested here, no matter what the difficulty setting after building all the peacetime infrastructure i could, i would then turn my factoryequipped cities to building nothing but howitzers and mechanized infantry, at a ratio of roughly 51, until i had something approaching 10 howitzers to each of the enemy cities i wanted to attack. i would then issue a formal declaration of war no reputationdamaging sneak attacks if i could help it and attempt to completely conquer the selected enemy in a single turn. and it almost always worked beating civ ii really did require nothing more than a lot of howitzers and a smattering of mechanized infantry. nukes were a distraction. civ iii prevented this tactic by introducing zone control and proper artillery units, which nerfed the howitzer although it was still an essential unit in penultimategame play. i never got into civ iv my computer at the time couldn't handle it, and i was both too frightened by my civ iii addiction and too offended by the idea that i couldn't build a settler and grow my city in the early game. and the way they tried to introduce religion was hamfisted. anyway, i'll be sad if i hear that you were just able to stomp the vikings and americans with howitzers and an army of avantgarde engineers. i'd have hoped that by the year 3991 a.d your mutant, swampdwelling opponents would have invented some new defensive tactics."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"at week 2 i would have got a strategy guide, look up some advanced tactics, and pushed forward with something. if it didn't work i would reload. but to spend 10 years and not move."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"i fought through end game once. it didn't last this far, but perhaps my strategy will help you. the best offense is a good defense, imo. i developed what i called the great wall of mongolia playing the mongols. it was a wall of defense completly surrounding my entire empire, over land and sea. for land it involved a wall of fortifications necessary to keep all units from dying in a single battle. then stacking the fortifications with defensive units mech infantry i think, i'm not 100 on which unit was best for this. completely surrounding the empire will keep enemy spies out. for the ocean, i would make a line of naval uits that involved a couple battleships, and at least one of the antiair ships forget their name, something else too i forget the names. this would keep enemy ships from entering my water space, as well as keep enemy aircraftmissles from hitting my cities. you also need an army of engineers. literally an army of them. more on that below. as the wars went on, each turn i would push my ocean wall closer and closer to the enemy, filling in it's expansion will additional stacks of the units as necessary. when it came time to take some additional cities, you use spies. you can either use spies to sabotage city walls and take the city by force with howitzers and tanks, or you can plant a nuclear device. i would usually, in a single turn, use dozens of spies to nuke an entire section of the enemy. then move in my engineers. the engineers would build roads and railraod everywhere, and clean up all the pollution from the blast. with enough engineers this can all be done in a single turn. engineers would take up most of the spaces around a city, but i would then use land units or sometimes bombers if there's poor terrain, to make sure that every square in the city radius is occupied. after that, i move a unit in and take the city. since all the city squares are occupied, this would prevent any enemy guerrila fighters from springing up around me. and since my army of engineers would put railroad around the entire area in a single turn, i could use the same land forces to go from city to city blocking off squares before capturing. tldrthe 2 key points to my strategy where, don't let any enemy units into my area at all, by building a human wall surrounding my empire. and engineers engineers engineers engineers. i think if you could find a way to cut off the enemy from entering your space, and hold the line defensively, you should be able to pump out engineers and rebuild your own empire first."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"it's been ages and ages so details are a bit fuzzy. i'm with donutef. he is describing the first stage, which basically is howto get more troups than the other guys, and that is through cleaning your land while holding your territory. you should have more than one workerstack that can clear up any land in one round, i would aim at 5. it may be necessary to create lots of small cities to support all the troups, i can't quite remember how the rules are on troops support is. anyway, the big point is that if you can clear your land, you will produce ultra fast, and thus become more powerful than your enemies. i can't remember ever building land from water, but if this is possible, it is worth a great deal trying to connect the americans and vikings by land. that they are not connected by land is your main strategical problem. the next stage is to hide your forces when they're multiplying, and while readying them for attack. i've had success with hiding the troops on ships by the poles extreme south or north. however there seems to be little water on your map, and i'm not sure how crowded the sea by the poles is. anyway, before launching your attack, make sure to fake an attack at the opposite front so that the nuclear weapons of your enemy is near exhausted. also make sure you have lots of money, to buy the anti nuclear stuff in your newly conquered cities. the best scenario would be to wait for the americans to launch an attack, then in the same round launch your own attack not so far away from the americanviking front. then in the next round, after the vikings have bombed and exhausted their resources on you and the americans, you swoop in with all your naval force from their hiding place by the poles, and nuke the enemy and land your increadible army. try to buy the anti nuke stuff immediately in each city you conquer. something like that. good luck!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-14,build at least 2 cities a few tiles away from the battlefeild. then produce all your military units in those cities. this reduces the amount of engineers you need to repair the roads because there is less travel distance. you can then use your extra engineers to clean up the swamp and nuclear wasteland to build farms and happiness buildings. this makes your citizens happy and stops uprisings. mines should also be a priority to increase the production of tanks and nukes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-15,ok now i am going to find it and play it
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-15,pics or it didnt happen
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-15,"just build sdi defenses in all your cities and you'll never be nuked again. the only possible way to keep a game going this long is to want it to go on this long. at any difficulty level, you could make something happen. all your coastal cities will be fine, because you can build harbors and offshore drilling rigs, so you will have plenty of food and shields. it's simply a matter of getting your engineers to work. i still actively play civ 2 on a weekly basis. the wonder movies are the greatest thing ever."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-15,"lycerius  here are some suggestions for a strategy involving bribery and defense. i tested these on your savegame file, and i made what seemed like significant progress after a few hours. i was able to capture over half of the viking cities while maintaining a strong alliance with the americans. fwiw, i still play civ2 now and then and i always play on deity highest level. general approach stockpile cash, buy out enemy cities, maintain adequate defense, build offshore platforms, maintain good american alliance  worry about land improvements later. the general idea here is to incite revolts in key viking city clusters. you'll capture associated military units while forcing the vikings to attack these already welldefended cities, leaving your core cities to stockpile cash, spies and military forces. 1 stop building factories in oceanadjacent cities. better to build offshore platforms where available they are more costeffective than factories and will immediately improve your ability to build units. harbors will help food production. 2 you have excellent air defenses in front line cities. maintainincrease the number of enemyadjacent sdi  sam defenses. 3 sell all unnecessary city improvements, including libraries, universities, supermarkets, cathedrals and for smaller cities aqueducts  sewer systems. always sell these in cities you purchase. this will allow you to create immediate liquid resources with which you can buy out more viking cities. 4 create lots of spies. use them to incite revolts and, if necessary, to target specific enemy infrastructure inc sam defense. your enemy will use spies against you, but while playing your savegame i noticed the ai using spies to destroy infrastructure. when playing on deity level, the ai will typically incite revolts. since you're playing as prince or king, that is less of a concern. 5 once you have tens of thousands in cash, sneak in multiple spies and incite revolts in viking cities well back from the front line. i concentrated on the jarlshof region and cities behind it. jarlshof, incidentally, gave me the united nations, which may help in future negotiations. these backline cities were highproduction cities and are well defended. 6 as you increase your hold over the viking empire, the cost of inciting revolts will decrease. 7 regularly talk to your ally. occasionally gift the americans with cash or military units. keep them happy and occupied with providing viking defense. 8 avoid using nukes. you'll just piss off your ally. you need to improve reputation as much as possible. 8 look for oil deposits. if you decide to build a new city, begin it adjacent to multiple swamp deposits. there are several such locations. 9 if you want to change to fundamentalism as many here have suggested either do it immediately or wait until you have massively overrun the viking empire. once you revolt, you'll suffer an immediate financial hit, and that will delay or set back your city buying plans. i don't see a sigifnicant problem with communism as you're currently constructed. you have no cities near revolt. 10 convert outlying cities to capitalization. this will help build cash resources more quickly. anyway, these are just a few thoughts. this strategy might fail in the long run, but it might work out if you have good planning, patience and luck. also, thanks for sharing your ideas and savegame. awesome stuff. cheers."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i've never played the game, so i don't know if this is possible or not, but here's an idea 1create a pact between one of the other nations to jointly attack the other nation. 2 as the two of you begin overcome the third nation, pull back and let your ally finish them off. 3immediately attack your ally, who will undoubtedly be weakened from the final push. while he was using all his resources for the war and taking the heat of the war off of you, you were secretly building up a surplus to use against him. it's machiavellian as hell, but it would probably work in real life...assuming your ally didn't notice you pulling back or already plan to attack you anyway."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-16,"as considered in the 58yearsolution by stumpster the civprosolution to the stalemate in the original eternal war even when staying with communism is rather simple  building offshore platforms  massing howitzers i generally did the same without knowing stumpsters solution, though it took me a little longer slower playstyle...and cunning vikings nuked edinborough, where i was gathering my army...forgot to build sdi. but as soon as you reach that point where you have a decent amount of howitzers it becomes too easy...so here's my suggestion i turned the original savegame into a scenario where i changed the following  you and the ai can't build offshore plattforms. the cities that had ops keep them. at 3991 earth should by out of oil anyways...at the latest...  howitzers loose their ability to overcome city walls. maybe city walls in 3991 could be interpreted as whole cities built below the earth being giant bunkers where even howitzers are of no greater use...could be reasonable after 1700 years of war...  celts are no longer allied to america. you only have a temporary truce. they hate you now as much as they hate the vikings.  the overall behavior of america is shifted slightly more to militaristic  the scenario will also give you the oportunity to play at a higher difficulty level and choose another faction. with all these changes i tried to keep true to the original feeling lycerius is describing. so maybe this scenario could bring up some other solution to the endless war  while providing a bigger challenge for advanced civ2 players....thus enriching the tewuniverse. so here's the file, hope that you and master lycerius like it scenariohttpsdl.dropbox.comu735014cua3991.scn disclaimer this is my first civ2 scenario so i'm not sure if everything works out as intended. i also didn't have time to test it up to now...so...feedback is highly appreciated"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"here's a tip build fortresses, and put two fortified mech infs in them. for some reason, having two units in one square renders them immune to espionage, and fortified mech infs behind a fortress are hard as rock. if these are sufficently close to a city then they will benefit from the neighbouring sdi too, so nukes are not anything to weorry about. if he can build a ring of these around a narrow chokepoint, it will prevent spies and enemy units from getting to your cities and planting nukes, thereby giving you time to organize your land a bit. this really needs to be the top priority, in my opinion."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"plus have your front line held by a cordon of units just outside of your cities, so spies can't get through. sdis protect at least one space all around the city iirc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,my suggested strategy. 1. carefully begin falling back brining the front lines closer to your own cities. ideally look for any narrow passages that will let you get some forts down to hold the lines with fewer units. 2. now the lines are closer to your cities there will be less roads to maintain so some engineering time can be devoted to teraforming the land around your core cities back into a state suitable for farming. 3. hopefully this will give you a slight production advantage over your adversaries. possibly allowing you some small resources to devote to further improvement of your cites. then begin rebuilding civilisation behind your iron curtain. i would avoid trying to directly attack your opponents still at this point. ether press your production advantages with the aim of creating a massive reserve army to wipe out the enemy forces. or advance your civilisation above the opposition to the point that you may be able to forge a more long term peace treaty with one nation.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"this works in risk all the time. post up in australia for a while taking a few countries here and there and when they think you've been pushed back and annihilated, whamo! you strike a line through to their capital. of course your enemies will try to make their way along your path of destruction and take out the dregs you've left behind but what they don't realize is that your advancements in production have left a hearty force at home which, when mixed with the pincer movement of your original forces which are now attacking their rear, will be enough to completely wipe out their forces. naturally this leaves you in a position of weakness to your other enemy. depending on their geographical location, this can be easily countered by spies bombing strategic locations and, if you played your cards right, fooling the remaining major opposition's forces into believing it was your first target which attacked them. once the two are squabbling over this and you've pulled out of the war effort due to local antiwar grass roots movements you can begin building up your defences. your people will be motivated to defend their homes and livelihoods as they see these two other forces brutalizing each other. nothing pulls a country together and makes them put up with so much shit as fear. fear of being attacked by the bad guys can only drive productivity. so, as these two evil nations prepare to deliver their final death blows to each other, you unleash operation hot mother in which you unleash all of your forces simultaneously upon either side beginning with strategic assassinations and bombings and continue driving your unlimited forces further into enemy territory. as this happens, you can begin to rebuild your farm lands and, once again, drive up productivity to the point where the other nations simply cannot match you. from here you should have only a few hundred years to recover from the nuclear fallout but in that time your space program should be so advanced that we should be fighting other planets anyway."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"wait, the war was real in 1984? been awhile since i read or saw it, but i thought the war was fake to keep the people thinking they had to do as they were told to win the war."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,i just finished reading 1984 for the first time yesterday and that was my exact thought reading this. including everyone starving and technology going backwards. fascinating.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,yeah that book was probably one of my favorites. none of the 3 powers even wanted to win. a major battle would only consist of a handful of casualties. that was the only way they could immortalize their power over their people.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"exactly what i was thinking, of course in 1984 we only get a vague idea how the situation was reached in the first place now thanks to civ ii we find out how and that it doesn't necessarily seem that unlikely."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,the party will take eurasia and win the war. i am a believer!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,maybe the developers of civ ii actually had 1984 in mind when developing this game. how do you beat the creator?!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"speaking as a nonciv player who just compares it to real world politics think about it, three superpowers is pretty much the only way it can stale like that. it's either a hegemony or a group of peaceloving hippy states which i don't believe will hold for long or three superpowers, all of which afraid to form an alliance because of the fear of being used and backstabbed. it's no wonder orwell chose that solution."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,i'm pretty sure this was also the origin story of the daleks.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,i thought the actual war was nearly pointless and the three nations at a government level coexist peacfully. they just use the war as an excuse to burn resources so there is perpetual need.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,but in 1984 it's debatable on whether or not there's even a war really going on. p

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-14,my first thought exactly...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-10-30,"when i read the op i was wondering if he intentionally did that. chilling vision of what our future would be like in the respect that it turned out so close to 1984, what orwell predicted."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"just a slight tidbit here, the three superpowers aren't too strong that they can never be defeated, it's that the leaders of the three superstates have no reason to try and wipe out eachother. they only fight the wars to use up excess resources, and they only fight in neutral territory, because if any of them were to fight in someone else's territory they would realize that they are all in similar situations. or at least that's what was implied in the book."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"the keyboard is covered in english, although by the font i can tell it's an old variant of the language. apart from the letters, which are ordered in a formation i cannot understand the topmost row starts with the unusual combination qwerty, i see the numbers 0 through 9, four arrow keys each pointing a different direction, a large button with enter written on it and another, long key with no label. i instinctively press the enter button and a presentation begins on the screen. apparently, the mansion belonged to one of the wealthiest men alive in history. i couldn't really understand how he did earn his fortune, but it was something to do with quantum computers, a technology long outdated. in the year 2012, which was 1979 years ago, there was some international panic from a predicted solar storm which would end humanity as we know it. the owner of this mansion built this machine, which is a huge database, to serve as a testament to human advancements in case civilization would be wiped out. the presentation goes on to explain how to navigate the database, and then fades to white as a nice looking menu pops out. the screen presents me with four options browse categories, search entries, replay introduction and export data. without hesitating i search swamp vegetation, only to find an entry about the long extinct eucalyptus tree, which was used in the past to dry up swamps. apparently back in 2012 no one even attempted to grow food in marshes. i try to search for more solutions, but find nothing i can use. just as i am about to give up and report the whole area so other scientists can drool over the historic database, i have one idea. an idea that proves to be the key to ending this war. i simply search for world war, and find 3 main entries. world war 1 and world war 2 were two largescale conflicts in the 20th century that are as good as ancient history to me, but what catches my eye was an entry titled world war 3. it describes a hypothetical war, identical to the one that has been going on for the past 1500 or so years  nuclear holocaust, completely global, likely never to end. and then there is a section named theorized solutions. reading this completely baffles me. i mean, it seems so simple that i just can't believe nobody though about it before. in the time this database was composed, this third world war seemed close than ever with the rise of the country iran as a dictatorship, which aimed to build nuclear weapons. to combat this while not starting a war so big, western civilization would develop computer viruses which disabled the nuclear facilities and halt iran's advances. now, cybernetic warfare is nothing new, but a specific virus, launched in the summer of 2012, caught my eye. codenamed phantom, the virus didn't target iran's nuclear facilities, but rather the personal computers of the people who worked there. the virus implemented specific pop ups and advertisements in those computer which subconsciously turned the workers and scientists against the government. then, using undercover agents, the western countries sparked a small revolt, which usually would not make a dent to the government. however, as the revolt broke, the nuclear facilities' employees immediately joined, brainwashed by the virus, and thus the rebels got hold on nuclear technologies. the government quickly fell, and the war was averted. the problem with using viruses was that now, important facilities can't be breached  virtual security is just that good. however, the average joe doesn't have access to that kind of security, so this plan could work. this could mean the end of the war. the rebirth of humanity. i explain the situation to my squad, and they all agree we must contact a highranking officer asap. we run outside, but as we enter the library we hear explosions above. we exit the house, only to be greeted by a missile launched from a drone up above. as i lie near a bush, i manage to get a glance around. my guards are all dead, most of them mutilated beyond recognition by the missile. we must have spent a few hours down there, because it seems like the celtics are launching an assault to capture the town again. as everything around me blurs out, i realize that with our death, the information of the virus will be lost until someone else visits this mansion, and now, seeing as it's mostly destroyed by the offensive, seems highly unlikely. if this war is going to end, it would be thanks to something else. it's funny, i just read how this world war 3 is likely to never end, and as i was about to finish it, the same war made sure that it would keep on going. i look back at the mansion, now collapsing, before i black out, probably for good this time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,we decide to call in a cod 4057 for a moment i though you talked about call of duty 4057 modern warfare 27
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"couple notes, op overall, it wasn't a halfbad story. it had an intereting premise that corresponded to the civ 2 post. i think you could expand on this a lot more and i might have to do so if you don't want to i'd be happy to collaborate on something. possible directions  develop this unnamed character more  flesh out the taking of the city. i'd persoanlly have a bit more fighting in the beginning but a barebones approach would be to detail the surroundings, the ruins, the mansion, etc.  cut out the convenient plot devices. i understand for this it's okay but an expansion needs a deeper, more rich experience.  the 2nd part of the post felt rushed and anticlimactic no offense. but, i can understand you probably just banged this out over the course of a few minutes so i don't hold it against you  my creative wheels are turning. damn this cubicle i sit upon while i wait to return home and fantasize about this world."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i apologise for the rushed job, but i hope you like my expansion of the original story.  we hadn't expected the americans to take back chicago. legend has it us vikings took it from them almost four centuries ago, and it's so small and insignificant they had never bothered retaking it. i'd been there a couple of times, and from what i can gather from the ruins and the myths of the citizens it was once a magnificent city made of glass and steel. skyscrapers rose thousands of feet above the millions of citizens bustling about their daily lives in the streets below. that is, if one city's population could ever hold that much. but that's what people say, 72 million was one of the largest apparently. hard to believe when you look around these days, even at our capital, which struggles to support less than 100,000. yeah, these days. the never ending war. how can something be never ending? oh well, that's not for me to think about. i get my rations for being a fighter, not a thinker. i've heard scientists have it pretty good don't have to get dirty on the front line, decent amounts of food, i've even heard some have started families, an opportunity no soldiers get. families? they're a thing of the past. apparently children are smarter if they're conceived naturally and then modified, whereas us soldiers, we're just clones. it's always fun to join a new unit, look around and three of the 14 people look exactly like you. and then we all have numbers no names. i'm 11155353. it's nice that my numbers form some sort of pattern, though i don't get much time to think about that, what with the fighting. i suppose the never ending war is sort of accurate, a soldier will never get more than a days rest once they're back from the front lines. if they get back from the front lines. our superiors seem to forget that clones are still human. thousands upon thousands of lives are lost almost on the hour. not like that matters to them. a thousand clones aren't hard to make, and they can be on the front lines as soon as their transport gets there after the three days training and growth. and i suppose that leads nicely up to where we are now. i was on my break in vancouver, meeting up with some new spawns, when the intel that the americans were launching an assault on chicago came in. and just like that we were off. we got there too late, of course. the americans had occupied the city. not that that was bad or different or hard, we'd just go in and take it back, just like they'd done the day before, and happens to most of the other cities on this planet daily. there was no point using missiles. ranging it was the slang used by us grunts. you know, like you attack from a.... eh forget it. we couldn't use missiles because there was no doubt there was a sdi installed, which meant to do anything we were going to have to get into its effective range. and so we did. 4,427th company launched a ground assault from the north. nothing out of the ordinary, couple of hundred tanks and a few gdr's. oh, gdr is giant death robot  some more of our slang. the incursion was completely ordinary, and we half expected them to be wiped out in a few minutes! but they in fact did not face much resistance. my squad was teamed up with three others to infiltrate the city from the west, hoping the northern incursion would prove enough of a distraction for us to break in and disable some of their defences. to be perfectly honest, once we were in the city walls we were scared shitless. empty. absolutely empty. we didn't know if they knew we were coming or what, but it made us nervous. it just wasn't right, you know? if it wasn't for the fact that we needed to stay silent, i reckon, heck, i know most of us would have been swearing. as i said, scared shitless. our fears were almost confirmed when a group of american soldiers walked out of a building. we were dumb enough to be in the middle of the street. contact! someone yelled and we all ran for cover while laying down covering fire. we had 60 men, they probably had 40, both sides had losses instantly as the street was filled with laser fire. i dove behind a blockade just as a bolt singed my helmet. too close, i thought. i looked beside me to see two more of our soldiers. one of them suggested we all stand up on the count of three and lay down some fire. we radioed across to the other side of the road to make sure they were ready with some grenades. we started counting. one. i positioned myself, ready to stand up. two. me and the soldier next to me's eyes met. i could see the fear in his eyes. ha, sounds like something from a story book, but you try fighting in a war. three. we all stood up, rifles blazing. the americans were caught offguard, thinking most of us had been killed and the rest fleeing. a few were downed instantly, while the others tried to fire back. without taking my finger off the trigger, i looked to my right, across the road. as i had hoped, the soldiers were standing up, grandes held high and ready to throw. they did, very accurately. the end result was almost all the americans in the group being killed, a fair number more when most of the roof they were next to collapsed. ion grenades will do that, you know. but i wasn't celebrating. aside from a quick glance to see the result, i was still looking right. our soldiers were taking cover next to an alley, and to my horror i saw four figures moving through the shadows, guns raised, towards our troops. i shouted, noo!!, trying to bring my rifle in time to fire back. my fears were confirmed when the figures' guns flashed, lighting up their uniforms their american uniforms. all our soldiers in front of them were razed instantly. luckily another one of us had seen them, too, up the street, and as soon as they left the alley they were gunned down by him and myself. i ran over to the limp bodies on the ground. there was no chance they were alive  they were all direct hits, but i had hope all the same. false hope. and the costs of the war hit me full on. i had been mostly insensitive to it, but i was overcome with the sudden realisation that these men laid their lives down in the false hope that there might be a winner in this war. it sounds stupid coming from a soldier, i mean, what do i know about it? but that is honestly what i thought. perhaps it determined my actions later that day. after regrouping we continued pushing through the city. there was no time, nor intentions largely, to mourn losses, but i paid my own silent tribute. we eventually met up with the northern incursion force, and were tasked with spreading out through the city to eliminate any remaining enemy forces. my squad and one other was assigned to go east. we were go to the very outskirts of town until we were at the wall, and then to come return. shoot to kill. we were approaching the wall and had only found three stray soldiers thus far. we were looking forward to the idea of turning around when we came across an old looking mansion with american soldiers outside. we instantly took cover but it was too late and they had seen us. one of them ran inside, probably sent for reinforcements i thought, and immediately reached for my targetor. hmm? oh, yeah, its a device that lets us target something to be taken out from afar. i targeted this building while the other soldiers fired on the americans. a green light came on on my targetor  target confirmed. i released the switch, and a few moments later missiles came raining from sky, coming from our new outpost in the city centre. it was perfect timing, too, as more personnel were emerging from the building. the mansion was razed instantly, of course. i think every soldier was killed in the blast, too. my troops and i waited for any signs of movement, and after there was none for a few minutes, we moved in for a closer look. there were a handful of survivors, and we were quick to disarm and apprehend them. but there was one who caught my attention. he was out cold, but certainly alive, pretty standard in every way, except he wore a white lab coat. i assigned a few soldiers to stay hidden with me and guard our prisoners, while the rest of the group finished the sweep. they met us on their way back after an uneventful walk. i had managed to wake the scientist up, but couldnt get anything out of him. we then began the walk back to the city centre where the rest of our companies would probably be waiting. youd say that was uneventful, would you? well, i suppose so would i. except for one thing. during his sleep the scientist was muttering something about an end. the end. what do you mean to what?  to this! to this war! an end to the war... huh, unlikely if you ask me. but i had hope, all the same."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"if you've never played a civ game before, then i'd recommend civ v whole heatedly. its not quite as intense as some of the others and it looks gorgeous. a great place to start."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,and sadly you could never do most of this in civ v.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,he hasn't beaten civ 2 yet... how do you exspect him to move on?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,for me civ v either ends with a un vote around 1950 or another player gets to space before me. how do you keep the game from ending so soon. it would be awesome to play up to year 3000. plus spies would be great to have.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,having owned all of the civilization games... why would you play civ v?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,wow. civ v seems so shit in comparison to what op's described.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,civ 2 doesn't allow for units to be improved. later ones had 'promotions' which can make individual units stronger through 'experience'. once you hit the all the technologies you can't get better units. not an unusual thing in mid 1990's

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"it has a curve. the early game goes through centuries at a time but once you get to around 1920, it goes in decades, by 1990, its years. it takes me about 815 hours of gametime to get to a normal win in the twentieth century. after that, and judging by his can afford to lose 20 tanks on the frontline without making a dent line. i'd say a turn probably takes him 15 minutes at least. multiply that by 2000 and its 515 hours game time. rough estimate."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,wrong tactic. at least on higher levels the enemy can pretty much build one every turn. much faster than you can build even the crappiest unit available. the key to winning is to never give him an opportunity to nuke you. sdi in every city and you are set. never have units outside or in cities not protected with sdi.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"hmm that's a great, interesting theory and seems to be to be possibly correct. the only flaw i could see is, why would they bother switching which country they are at war with? a terrific passage in the book involves the name of the enemy changing midpep rally and the crowd doesn't even notice. also, nextyeardc's idea of a more tech advanced north korea is creative and fascinating!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"yeah i always took from winston's big relevatory sequence towards the end that even if those countries exist it's far more likely that the occasional explosions in the slums are just bombs planted by their own government in order to simulate the experience of being at war, thus giving the people of oceania an unseen 'other' to rally against. for me, that makes the ending even more chilling. that it's not just that this war could never stop because the nation's involved are so powerful, but that none of them even want to stop the illusion of it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,also if they are at war it's likely the war is one in which the warring states are at war as part of some high level agreement to keep their populations under control with no real intention of harming each other politically.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"it's almost certain that, at the very least, the rocket bombs supposedly dropped by eurasia or eastasia depending on where you are in the book are actually dropped by oceania's government. the fact that they become conspicuously more deadly and more frequent in the runup to hate week alone makes that clear."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"no, they went over this in the book. a conflict must exist otherwise there wouldn't be any point in changing who oceania is at war with. we have always been at war with eurasia even though yesterday we were at war with eastasia."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"no, i think orwell objectively makes the point that three major superpowers do exist. chapter iii war is peace the splitting up of the world into three great superstates was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united states, two of the three existing powers, eurasia and oceania, were already effectively in being. the third, eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. the frontiers between the three superstates are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic landmass, from portugal to the bering strait. oceania comprises the americas, the atlantic islands including the british isles, australasia, and the southern portion of africa. eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier, comprises china and the countries to the south of it, the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria, mongolia, and tibet. in one combination or another, these three superstates are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twentyfive years. ... to understand the nature of the present war  for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war  one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. none of the three superstates could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. they are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable. httpmsxnet.orgorwell1984 edit these are assertions by goldstein, arguably the voice of orwell."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"but then there would be no need to keep switching the enemy from one to the other, which is wasteful in consuming time and resources."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,there is a scene in the book where captured enemy soldiers are being driven in trucks through the streets. so obviously some form of war does exist with another nation.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"there is... a possible solution, but you will not like it. it will require you to give up your ideals, your ambitions, and your honor. you must sacrifice yourself, your nation, and your people, to assure peace for mankind. you must ally yourself with the americans, or the vikings, and as short as the alliance will last, you need this edge. throw yourself at the remaining enemy. he must be crippled beyond repair. your ally will turn on you, this is expected. you will die, this is expected. your armies will lose, this is expected. your enemy will not be defeated, not by you, this is expected. you will cripple your enemy, and mortally wound yourself, and your temporary ally will destroy you. but he will also defeat your enemy. and peace will return to mankind."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,surely op will deliver... let's just wait.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"i ctrl  f'd for 'engineer' and saw no mention of a civ ii tactic you may wish to employ. building an engineer in a 1population city presents you an option to erase the city from the map, improvements and all. i hope you've been selling every improvement that you don't need in the apocalypse each turn, incidentally. if i'm remembering correctly, the kicker here is that the engineer will have a home city of none, meaning you can skip the food support requirement. an uprooted, enslaved, selfsupporting city to do your bidding in eternal starvation. please correct me if i am remembering this wrong. you can use this to make an sdifree noman's land to burn and bleed your enemy if that will serve you, or to ensure that enemy production centers go down and stay down. the rushbuilt engineers will probably be more useful to you than the vulnerable and polluted cities, and they can join your own cities and pump them up to size 8. this may be enough to make viable cities on the coast with rushbuilt harbors, or to contribute to production in the towns with hills or whales if they starve slowly enough. ideally, relocate them to sanctuary cities safe behind your lines. not much worth a damn on the screenshots of your planet except the whales and hills anyway. so that's the slaver option. on to genocide! your commieproduced veteran spies can do some incredible damage poisoning water supplies and dropping off nukes. each nuke halves the population, and i don't see any cities larger than size 12. and those people won't be coming back in your world. dead is dead. nobody is running a food surplus. fifteen million seven hundred thousand can go quicker than you'd think. so at least you have a way to kill chicago and that little american island east of tintagel on the cheap, potentially in one turn or two. you can daisychain transports by transshipping units using the sleep command if memory serves, or by moving the units from ship to ship in midocean regardless. and spies are amphibious, so if there's not a ship parked on every ocean tile abutting a city you can get in and do your damage without any chance for a response. aaaand spies ignore zones of control, so you can use them to get your occupier units onshore. then just back your transport off one space and hope your nukes get through. the spies die or teleport home, your transport and occupying unit probably get shot to hell the next turn unless you get lucky with parking a bomber on them, but you've killed a hundred thousand survivors who ain't coming back. it won't win you the war, but there's not much that can stop you from doing all this damage. if you can't control the game, control the board. the military stalemate will be much more malleable when there are ten celts to every living american and viking. tldr you're already complicit in genocide, kidnap small cities wholesale and have your veteran spies rise out of the ocean to murder the wretched surviving civilians like a lovecraftian elder god."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,til reddit is filled with writers.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"hate to be negative because i loved your story, but what pulled me out of the fiction was imagining what would be left of books that were 2000 years old, or trying to imagine how a computer would still work. even with climate control, solar power, nuclear power, etc, various things would make the building decay. rats eating wires, dust from centuries of nuclear battles clogging intake and exhaust fans. erosion from rain, unchecked plant growth, etc. without caretakers of some sort the place would certainly fail. maybe the caretakers were robots who knows, but the fact that soldiers can casually pick up 2000 year old fiction books and read them just seems out of place."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"the story goes from past to present tense....i'll stick with past usually the experience of awaking with a pounding, throbbing pain in your temples and a sore body was testament to an evening to substance abuse. i was not used such experiences, with the rationing being rather severe the last decade. alcohol was nearly impossible to find, and even the ratty home made versions of it were rare. groggily i sat up, the darkness illuminated by burning embers and neighboring houses set alight and battered by the enemies missile barrage. small arms fire peppered in the distance, giving a macabre closing hymn for this funeral pyre i was situated in. my men were eviscerated, severed limbs were settled around me like leaves falling from trees with the changing of the seasons. not that i had ever witnessed that phenomena firsthand, but when i was younger the tales of lush green forests enthralled me. once i viewed a grove of pines, with green needles. that valley is gone now, i thought morosely, destroyed in last years nuclear strike. just radiation and despair now. there was a faint moaning sound to my left under rubble from the mansion. i knew i would not want to see what was left of the soldier under there, but i stood and staggered over to him. sometimes holding a dying ones hand or comforting them in their last moments made the transition easier. usually we just put a bullet in their heads, but with potential enemy troops nearby i opted out of that decision. i removed the pieces of brick, mortar, and wood to find one of the ammunition carriers from my machine gun section. help me, for god's sake, help, he croaked, barely audible. i could not find any trace of his legs below the knees. they were ragged stumps, with bits of bone poking out the ends. the charring from had moderately cauterized the viscous wound, staunching the blood loss that would have been quickly fatal otherwise. the boys midsection had been ripped open, and his innards were on his lap and pooling over the side of his torso. i could see the intestines glistening because of nearby fires. help me....i want to go home....it hurts so much, tears ran down his sooty face, little clean rivulets on an expiring surface. i knew he was done for, there was not one doubt about it. then i heard it. vehicle engines. they were coming down the street. i ducked down beside the boy, and put my hand over his mouth to cover up any sort of noise he could produce. the tires stopped and i heard soldiers dismount. beads of sweat dripped down my face, and i could feel my body become tense. were they friend or foe? the injured child was squirming now, and the groans were becoming incessantly louder. shut up, i whispered coldly. just shut up or we're both dead. i saw the silhouettes of the men as they fanned out and could tell by the formation pattern that they were not friendly. they rifled through the rucksacks of my dead soldiers, taking rations and clothing. there would be nothing else of value in them. i watched one of the enemy take a small book from the pack of my dead medic presumably, as he had been the only openly religious man in the section. a lot of good that did him, i said in my head. the boy flailed his arms, foolishly believing that the men who walked among us as we lay in rubble would provide aid. his rapid movements knocked over a chunk of concrete or stone, in the darkness i was unsure. regardless it fell to the ground and bounced off a wooden beam with an audible noise. i could see some of the soldiers tense up and some hit the ground instantly, trying to get to cover. some of them stood and did not move at all. i knew they were definitely new replacements, fresh meat for the unending slaughter. one walked over to us, sauntering slowly, systematically pausing along the way. he was mere meters away. i wanted to run, to bolt away and scream. i let out a string of expletives mentally and felt my bladder relax without my permission. the urine soaked my trousers. my hand was still tightly gripped over the injured boys mouth, but the soldier was so close he would hear the muffled breathing anyways. with caution i removed my trench knife from my sheath and had it at the ready. any second this soldier would see that we were not debris. his rifle had a nasty looking bayonet on the edge, shining bright from the fires. steady boy, steady, i whispered. he did not comply and cried softly. i knew i was done for. the man had heard and was fast approaching, so i lay my head down on the scorched earth and feigned dead. please, please.... the injured boy said to the enemy. i heard the bayonet stick into the boys body with a sickly noise. he screamed, the death rattle piercing the night, and shook violently. i used his death to my advantage and utilizing my free arm to keep my opponents rifle from rising i leaned up and quickly thrust my knife deep into his bowels. he shrieked as well and i felt warm blood coat my hand as he went limp and collapsed to the ground in horrific pain. this situation had become worse with each second. the rifle was stuck because of the bayonet in my dying ammunition carrier, who was still screaming and flailing listlessly. he was dead but he did not know it. i pulled it out hastily and checked to see if the safety was off. voices were yelling at each other in the darkness. i fired towards silhouettes and shadows, and made sure to put a round in my soldiers head to spare his suffering. i left the enemy i had stabbed writhing and groaning. as i sprinted away i could heard the hiss and snap of bullets as they narrowly missed me. the terror was unimaginable. i was manic, completely on auto pilot but horrified all the same. i wanted to crawl into my mind and stay there. i wanted this to end. i wanted to be in another body. it was like i was in a dream, just a long dark dream that was not meant to be. poor eyesight and darkness combined are a ghastly duo and soon enough i tripped and fell, rolling down a slight hill before coming to a stop. every bone in my body was sore, and i thought about the eyes of my young ammunition carrier. larga something or other. first name unknown. sixteen. dead, for the nation and the people. disgusting. his eyes were looking to me for safety, for aid. i effectively killed him. if his parents were living, i imagine how they would take the news. yes commissar, we understand our son died valiantly and gloriously on the field of battle. it was a quick death and he was a hero, and all of that compiled bull shit. i felt dry in the throat, and vomited bile on myself as i sat in relative silence. how long had i been running? thirty seconds, or thirty minutes, i would have not known the difference. my weapon was out of ammunition. but the bayonet was still on it, with a sixteen year olds blood of course. i stood and walked into the dark, the rumble of artillery in the distance a supple reminder of the utter hell i lived in."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"good story, but too self aware  of history, of the current political context, and of 21st century culture. the modern peoples would likely not even speak english anymore. if they did, it would be nowhere close to ours. old english  very incomprehensible  existed a mere 500 years ago. 2000 years would take a larger toll. our narrator  a common engineer or scientist, whichever  would have a relatively short life span, given the average lifespan of the other endlessly regurgitated engineers rushed through horrifically brutal academic regiments that make 21st century university curriculum look like a long summer vacation. besides his scientific engineering academic regiment, he's not trained to be a freethinker. all new technology has already been considered 'discovered' or not worth investing in. he's merely trained to do what's already been done and necessary. freethinking would also threaten the communistdictatorstate turned fundamentalist theocracy. he would be fully indoctrinated in state propaganda. you'd pretty much have to be to be fighting such a constant, pointless, continual war while going hungry every day of your life. since the primary motivator of all wars in history  wealth, has been long forgotten by all three parties who constantly bombard each other in a mutuallydestructive arrangement for centuries on end  the only lasting motivators must be deepseated nationalistic hatred, the likes of which have never been seen heretofor, or .... war legitimately based on religious belief the viking empire is a theocracy ala the crusades. not even fake religious motivations  like the war in iraq, nay, war is decided by the leaders, and minus wealth motives, this war must truly be about religion or nationalism. to sustain such a war would mean living in society with tremendous indoctrination, xenophobia, selfworshipping, etc. those are a few elements that could have been added."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"in every civ game i've played, once nukes are used a peace treaty is a joke that lasts about as long as a cupcake on a fat person's wake. i haven't played civ ii in a very long time, but if i was in your boots i would take one worker and start to clean up an area away from any city you own. it'll take a while to clean up the fallout and swamp, but just one tile that can provide food could be enough to swing the war in your favor. second, i wouldn't build any stacks of death but flood my borders wall to wall with 2 or 3 unit stacks. your losses to nukes will be lowered, and your homeland will be protected. keep the americans and vikings fighting while you rebuild a location. the world will then be yours. i don't if it will work, but it sounds solid to me. then again, i haven't had my morning coffee yet. grain of salt and all that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,i actually wasn't trying to conquer the world. there's your mistake.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"my guess is that it's not a glitch, exactly, but that they have some some logic that evaluates the state of the world and decides the probability of breaking a treaty, and the situation in which you've been locked for 1700 years sets that probability right near 100."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"think of it like this the vikings keep attacking because they know that there's no way you can launch an offensive without time. i don't know the exact nature of civ2 but i think that the guy who suggested exhausting their nukes and then rolling in with conventional forces was correct, assuming their own conventional forces aren't able to match you was on to something."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,i could help with that.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"ah, but there are ways. i'm pretty sure this tactic will work in civ2, but it's been a very long time since i played that. i know it will work in freeciv, as that's where a friend and i perfected it. the scenario we were dealing with was lategame where everyone had almost all of the tech, and we were attempting to take a densepacked enemy continent over 100 cities, massively rail integration between all of them. we landed, took one city, and that immediately sparked a massive swarm of howitzers boiling out of every other city on the continent to retake it. repeat this a few times, same deal. finally, we realized a few things. 1 bombers can take off on one turn and return to base on the next. 2 ground units can't enter squares occupied by enemy aircraft. realizing this, our path became clear. we proceeded to park a couple of carriers off shore, then used our bombers to screen off one or two enemy cities from the rest of the continent, switching them out every turn to maintain the line. we then pounded those cities into rubble and took them to establish a bridgehead and base for our bombers, moved in more units, and slowly extended the line across the entire northsouth axis of the continent as we took more cities. i think when we were midway through the process, we had around 70 active bombers and a screening wall 30 squares long. i think you could use this same tactic in civ2, perhaps with a bit more buffer space between your bomber screen and the cities you take to avoid having nuclear strikes on newlycaptured cities take out the line. the one thing we didn't have to deal with there was enemy nukes  they didn't have any. man, i miss civ."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"true. i also recall that railroads give you infinite movement in civ2, so paratroopers aren't really needed, any unit would do. but i guess you'd really need to take out basically the entire empire in one turn to prevent a counterattack."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-13,"the reason to infiltrate to every city is to be able to transport your nuke freely up to the capital, i assumed first but on second thought flying objects like nukes ignore the enemy units around and can travel freely. this way my idea does not make sense, why would he then suggest to have a spy in every city?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"the absolutely best way to learn it is to have an experienced dwarf fortress player within physical reach so you can pull them over to your computer and go wtf is this? this is obviously a rare opportunity. the second best way to learn it is to have experienced dwarf fortress players to talk to. irc channels are great for this. if you can find a df irc channel that is decently populated and doesn't mind answering newbie questions and in my experience most don't mind at all  we all remember how painful it was to learn, you're set. ask loads of questions and you'll learn a lot. the third best way to learn is via tutorial, like the one fedak linked to. this can handily be combined with the two previous methods for great success!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2012-06-12,"really? my favorite fluff was always that the ironclad crew came up with a brilliant plan, which worked out. i preferred this to the more likely explanation that the unit has at least some modernized weapons. may 25th, 1952. ambrosius baumgartner, captain of the german ironclad krupp today an indian fighter squadron attacked our trusty krupp while we were fulfilling our this year's mission to defend the gulf of munich. high command set us back here in the deep north to keep our outdated ship out of harm's way, but war is cruel and it found us today. the ship has fought many a great battle, but against a modern fighter squadron, she shouldn't stand a chance. she is no modern cruiser, after all. the first two striving runs nearly took us out and many good men lost their lives. all seemed lost, when kanonier velmer had an idea. when they returned for the third time, he fired all cannons at once, without any balls loaded even, just as they were going into their descent on us. the heavy, oily smoke that arose from the mounds of our ancient weaponry must have blocked their sight by pure luck for us. and what luck it was, as the strife not only missed us completely, but the whole squadron was not able to pull up in time anymore. when i heard all cannons firing, i thought we were lost. but upon seeing the aftermath, i was dumbfounded. we thanked our god and our king, when it was clear that we were victorious in the most uneven battle since the stand of the pikemen hundred years ago. as long as i live, i will never forget this day when brave kanonier velmer saved all our souls with his ingenuity."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"instead of giving random titles she may or may not like, ill give a comprehensive answer that could potentially make any none gamer get into gaming apologies for the yapping in advance firstly, see what the person is interested in outside of gaming are they into music? movies? whats their favorite genre? do they have a hobby theyre really invested in? do they like good stories? is there a certain fantasy they like to be immersed in? like go on an adventure, live a cozy simple life, become a wizard or even a villain of some sort? see what type of aesthetic do they enjoy, recommend fantasy titles if they like fantasy obviously. if theyre a fan of certain movies then recommend the movies game to them if its good of course. for example if they like star wars a recent recommendation is star wars jedi fallen order. if they like a certain level of freedom and exploration while simultaneously living in an epic fantasy then elder scrolls games is what i recommend, usually would recommend skyrim but both oblivion and morrowind are good too. if they like puzzle games and are also interested in good stories then the professor layton series is my go to recommendation. basically, try to see what they would enjoy outside of holding a controller, or a mouse and keyboard, and just pressing buttons. gaming is immersive by nature, and they would immerse themselves further if their gaming experience aligns with their interests and hobbies outside of gaming. i guarantee theres a game out there for every interest under the sun, so finding a title anyone, even a none gamer, would enjoy should not be difficult."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"a lot of the suggestions are for very easy and or accessible games which is fine i think, but i'm going to go against the grain here and recommend a sort of start at the deep end kind of thing that's not just a meme. i think an experience that could really sell the idea of gaming and the appeal of games in the fullest package while also being an excellent learning tool that's not too disorienting or overwhelming while teaching and showing off an incredibly wide array of mechanics, terminology and gaming concepts would be an ideal start and to thst end i recommend a metroidvania. they are 2d yet they greatly reward exploration and promote map navigation. they have a relatively simple control scheme but a fair challenge to combat and a good balance of combat, platforming and puzzles. they tend to have notable boss encounters. they can have light rpg and progression mechanics and equipment management and item use. and they have relatively simple stories that aren't too difficult to follow. plus there is a huge variety of them in terms of flavor, aesthetic, mechanics emphasized and difficulty that it should be easy to find a perfect fit for a first gaming experience. for more concrete recommendations there's stuff like hollow knight, momodora 3, bloodstained ritual of the night, the og symphony of the night, yohane the parhelion blaze in the deep blue this one is especially good for beginners imo, ribirabi and many more."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"in my experience camera is a big struggle so first person games are usually a big nono, even third person shooters can be hard so go with cover based one in case so the player can hide behind something and only mind about aiming, the player will practice aim and looking around in different situation which feels less stressful. i, for example, found uncharted to be succesful as a first game for people that are willing to learn for the reason written up here  story, for others who don't want to get stressed out while playing i suggest more chill games without the need to control the camera sidescrollers, top view or whatever, those are usually the best choice."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"my suggestion would be something turnbased, or slow and with indirect controls. like 'craft the world', where you click on rocks to mine them, click on trees to chop them, and your dwarfs will go and do it on their own. without you needing to take direct control of them and do it manually which you can also do in that game if you want. basically a lot of gamers have gamer brain, and muscle memory for controls mouse  keyboard combo, wasd, etc, but nongamers don't. so you can't give a nongamer a game that requires a gamer brain, and expect them to know the tropes and established norms that they know nothing about. so stardew valley, as people suggest, wouldn't be my first choice. it's too complex, direct control, limited for timestamina per day, and it doesn't tell you a lot of stuff like which npc likes what, at least it didn't last time i played. so that one is too complex and problematic for a complete novice. so i'd go for something selfdriving and noncombat that basically lacks a game over screeen at all, because it's just not possible. something like the sims, where you start with a premade house, and your sim takes care of itself 90 of the time. and once she's comfy with gaming concepts and has a bit of gamer brain, then you can move on to other stuff. if she's ok with shooting, xcom series on easiest difficulty is pretty good. again, turnbased, largely selfdriving at first. then get started on direct control."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"any of the lego games. teaches you simple platforming, puzzle solving and exploring. story fps games on easy like halo, or maybe call of duty. teaches you how to aim and shoot and walk around in fps and there is little to keep track of. even easier, power wash simulator, because you cant die. this may sound dumb, but once she gets the basics, if you have an elden ring or souls game file on the first play through and are high levelend game, you can get her to run around and kill easy mobs. low risk of dying, teaches fighting mechanics in an action game at a very refined level. also gives an opportunity to experience tracking of location, healing, fighting multiple mobs etc. enemies constantly respawn after resting and would die in 12 hits easy.m on ps5, astros playroom."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i'm gonna recommend getting her a hand held system. like the steam deck or switch. but start her with story based games where the controls are added as she plays and not given all at once. start with older games, the triple a's aren't really designed for new players. let her figure out controls. tell her when she asks how to do a thing. if she wants to try a shooter, try something unrealistic that isn't fornite. halo would be good but i know you've got the playstation. try something similar? aim, shoot, grenade, melee, simple. less she'll be expected to keep track of us better. less hud at first is better. starting with games in third person is usually easier for new players. skyrim is a good start for fantasy games. there isn't much of a wrong way to play and the characters are interesting. avoid the fallout series until she's more used to a hudenvironmental dangers. assassin's creed might also be good to try? easy games with few dangers are good for learning to monitor ones environment. sky children of the light minecraft slime rancher stray games like grounded are good for teaching crafting elements. while i don't personally like it, if she likes disney, dream life valley is a good one. coral island is very task oriented. i found that it's easier for new players if they're constantly giving the task. dredge is a good game if she likes horror movies or doesn't mind the occasional spook. it also teaches time management and resource management. either of the little nightmares ones are good for teaching how to keep your character oriented on the screen. i've noticed that a lot of newer players don't have the situational awareness for their character. it's a new skill they have to learn. this one's only good if she likes horror. any of the sherlock games are great for puzzles and mystery. and forces you to constantly think about the story. it does help that the controls aren't very difficult. my time in portia  my time in sand rock are good games at teaching her time management without having a rush to get things done. also, because it's in third person, it does help you keep track of the environment around your character. life is strange starts with easy controls and slowly teaches you more complex mechanics of the game. i don't know a lot of playstation games so i hope that i got the ones that i know are on playstation. anyways, best of luck to the two of you!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i would have them look up or watch lets plays on a few games. i would start with the cozy ones and go from there. the staples  stardew valley  has co op if i am not mistaken, has combat mines light resource management. it is generally considered a safe game. coral island  much like stardew valley but no coop as of right now, it's planned but better visuals. pokemon  it's not hard to get the basics and get started. there's also games like palia or animal crossing episodes might get two overwhelming too fast for someone completely new. the sims 4 base game is free  no combat if they are worried about that, tons of months and cc's to make the game how you want on pc. something like the paper mario series or some of the other mario games. there's a reason that mario's a classic. princess peach was just released. cozy  city building  if you guys are in two more medieval things manor lords is out now. however there is combat where you have to direct troops and people raiding you. people are comparing it to another game called banished. wandering village  tiny city building  environment changes which can damage you. it also kind of depends on her interest, if there's someone who likes you and to go to sleep and things out maybe city skylines would be a good idea it's like simcity. i would have her look at certain channels like sarah sunstone please almost only cozy games. i would find things that but she likes to do in real life as a bridge into gaming. do they like to drive or watch nascar, thinking i'm a racing game, are they into gardening well maybe try gardening life, are they secretly a city planner then city skylines would be a good deck or another city building type. they have games that were completely on engines for if you're into mechanical engineering, i would truly look at what they enjoy in life and then find something along those lines. however i do not suggest mario kart it gets too frustrating too fast if it's your first game. also i wouldn't suggest anything like the wii games where you're using your body or vr, you want to find regular games games have fit inside genres like racing, cozy, rpg that's sort of stuff. i didn't list any rpgs because those can be kind of hard to get into if you're not already used to what an rpg is, however if you guys play dd or something along those lines heck yeah start with rpg!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i think you're looking for some very active and fun with a simple yet engaging story so maybe castlevania, titles like symphony of the night, order of ecclecia or aria of sorrow. mario games, yoshi island and mario and the bunnies come to mind. uncharted 4, this is like a playable action movie but longer, the previous entries are fun but this one is unique. kyrby, i mean this franchise is awesome. crash bandicoot remakes, all the way to crash team racing and the 4. zelda games, twilight princess come to mind. ico, shadow of the colossus, etc,, you would need to explain a few things but this are impressive games. the last of us, very cinematic and scary experience. metal slug anthology collection, has any other game aged as good as this one? and you can play together. the witcher 3, slow paced, more story oriented, lot of stuff to do with create characters. warframe, addicting gameplay, very easy but story is a mess tho. those from the top of my head, hope you find a why you're looking for op. if my 8 years old cousing was able to learn in a few mins how to handle the sticks of a controller so does your friend."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"cracks knuckles i have been waiting with this beginner's guide to gaming for so long  sackboy a big adventure  relatively simple platforming, no camera controls, cute environments and fun costumes to create and customize.  minecraft on easy or peaceful mode  sure, there's a lot to minecraft, but the basics are very simple. this will get her used to standard video game mechanics such as movement, camera controls, aiming at targets, and item management.  lego games  pick a franchise she's into from the list of lego games, and try it out. the controls are pretty simple, and there'll be some platforming to get her better used to that as well.  it takes two  other people have suggested it and it has been shot down due to it requiring a little video game knowledge, but after going through the previous games, this shouldn't be too bad to tackle.  skyrim or fallout  if she wants to start stepping out on her own, these are both good for getting into. difficulty slider is still available if she's not picking it up quickly. alternative suggestion if she doesn't like the vibe would be horizon zero dawn, not as much customization on the playstyle, but third person view can help some people and also gets her more prepared for action games rather than just rpgs  fortnite  i know what you're thinking, and hear me out. despite the community, fortnite is actually really solid for starting off, especially just due to the absolute variety in it. zero build mode has a lot of bots, so she can get into competitive gunplay without being stomped or having to worry about learning to build, rocket racing is a good intro to racing games, festival mode basically rockband is just chill fun that can help with reaction times, and lego fortnite is a viable substitution for minecraft if you don't own it and don't wanna pay for it. by this point she should be wellversed in the way video games work and feel. it's up to you at that point to guide her into the things she will like and the things you'll enjoy together. good luck!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"ehh depends of what kind of games he'd like. for rpgs i'd go with skyrim because it's simple and easy to wrap your head around. even nongamers will look at someone playing it and will be interested, in watching for a mijute or two at least. it's not as vague and doesn't require gaming knowledge. rts? probably some with recognizable things, like little tanks and soldiers. or something medieval, because all boys like knights and archers and cavalry and castles and catapults and stuff like that. an age of empires game maybe? i know some friends who liked stronghold because you're collecting all kinds of resources and things like that. boys like sports or shooters most often, even if they couldn't be bothered to try out any other genre. at least that's what they liked to play in public game rooms, from my experience. i know girls usually like the sims games, or things like zoo tycoon. my cousin liked fable and a funnylooking car racing game, for some reason. i've never seen a girl play an rts, and rarely an rpg or maybe a colourful shooter. well, i'm sure there are exceptions."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,for learning controls journey for 3rd person camera portal for 1st person mario for everything else
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"so, lets start with breaking down game design a little bit. the challenge of a game tends to come from four primary sourcesresources time, health, movement, and knowledge. most games utilize two of these, while games known for their difficulty use three or all four. likewise, easy games use only one, or allow you to selectively disable part of the set. a classic example of this is the yoshi series, which lets you enable mellow mode to make it impossible to die via falling in holes. since switch is out, pick up something low stakes that uses her preferred resource. if she likes puzzles, try something like the monkey island series to get her used to moving with a controller and interacting with her environment. knowledge is the key resource, and while movement is involved it isnt used in a way where she has to have mastery of it to not die. if she wants something she can play with you as a carry, it takes two is fun with an engaging story, or pick up a copy of diablo 3 on playstation for couch coop and start on the super easy difficulties. if you wanted a reason to acquire a switch, you wont find a better one. nintendo is imho the undisputed king of beginner friendly games, from animal crossing to the more recent mario games where you can play multiplayer, and she can bubble herself to let you solo through the harder jump sequences. plus, it lets her play something easy on the couch in handheld mode while youre playing a harder game on the tv. it gives her a space where she can learn at her own pace without feeling like shes tying up resources if it takes her 20 min to nail the muscle memory for something we could do in a single pass."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"my wife isnt a modern gamer. she played nes and snes and shit like that, back in the day. since weve been together, i have always been a gamer and she never really tried playing anything with me unless it was like trivial pursuit or one of those other games where you only have to press one or two buttons. since she was more of an old school gamer, she wasnt used to all the buttons and joysticks. then i downloaded that power washer game its on game pass, not sure if playstation has it and she loved it. she picked it up pretty quickly and started playing that. then we got a switch and now shes playing mario golf, mario kart, mario party 8 and all those types of games. i dont know if shes still skilled enough to play games where you have to move around and rotate the camera  so you may want to look into something simple to start."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"depends on the skills you want to teach. for being able to navigate in a 3d world, learn interacting and an inventory system, i'd go minecraft. it's simple enough that kids can learn it, and honestly it's the greatest 3d interface tutorial on the planet. after that, you just need to find entry level games that have the mechanics that you want to teach, and build her skill set so that she can then pick up games that interest her and not be overwhelmed by the labors of playing the game, rather than enjoying the game she's playing. my wife and i are currently playing it takes two, and the mix of mechanics and whatnot allow her to try a broad range of things."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"so my girlfriend has always been close but on the outskirts of gaming and a year and some change ago i got her a steam deck. heres a list of some games shes played to completion stardew valley still playing actually since i got her the sd expanded mods hades spirit farer ori and the blind forest katamari damacy to the moon unpacking a short hike night in the woods fall of porcupine telltales walking dead season 1 and 2 telltales the wolf among us bastion gris frog detective 13 little misfortune a little to the left monster prom 13 turnip boy commits tax evasion theres several others that shes put some time into that she hasnt finished yet or bounced off of entirely. id say most of these are pretty good choices for a beginner. maybe leave something like ori or hades for when the controls become a little more familiar as a way to graduate to a new tier of skill. as it stands though, she still has major trouble using the right stick to look around in first or third person mode in games that allow it but its a work in progress."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"on ps, i usually recommend little big planet and the respective games. it's fun, it's cute, easy to pick up, lots of great simple platforming games to get used to playing, so on and so forth. although, i remember hearing some news about the servers or something but i can't quite remember what, so worth looking into it. the lego games are all absolute gems to get started with. especially if she's a fan of one of the movies they're adapting, like star wars, indiana jones, harry potter, pirates of the caribbean, etc. it's delivering a known story with a twist of humor and whimsy in the form of lego pieces. lego games don't have dialogue, so when vader drops a major twist on luke, the game gets very creative and funny on how vader is trying to portray the information. sim games are also really popular with players starting out. stardew valley is on windows and you can play multiplayer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"whichever ones she thinks look interesting tbh i think people largely will just learn things if theyre interested in them, regardless of the perceived difficulty. a lot of peoples first games as kids were final fantasy games, or wow, or counter strike, or even now games like fortnite, and we all just learned because we wanted to play them. just scroll through steam or show her trailers of things and see if she really latches onto something."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"the lego games are great starting places. controls are simple, puzzles aren't too difficult, stories are familiar but with legos brand of humor added in, and the levels have a lot of replayability as only certain characters can do things, which means later you can come back to a level with new characters and it plays in a different way. i recommend the star wars or indiana jones ones, haven't played the new ones so i can't comment on them"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,portal 2 honestly is a great starter because it introduced them to first person 3d games which is often the biggest obstacle for a lot of people.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i agree with recommendations for journey. it's a good low risk introduction to modern dual stick character movement  camera controls. however, i would strongly recommend signing out of psn to play the game in offline mode. the presence of another player could be distracting as well as the fact that they may go around advancing the minor puzzles and depriving your gf of actually learning the game. abzu is in the same vein but i think is a bit tougher to come to grips with the controls as the character is swimming instead of walking. to kick it up a notch, i might recommend stray, especially if your gf likes cats. however, there are some parts of stray that might be challenging for someone with no gaming experience, so that's slightly harder to recommend. however, the challenging sections are short and fairly spaced out, while most the game is exploration. so if your gf is having trouble, you could step in and complete those for her while she plays teh rest of the game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i'd suggest games with simple mechanics. i also use games where your character really die, and where there is no clock running backwards. for example animal crossing, the sims or pc adventures."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"anything that does not have 3d controls. 3d platformers and fps is bad for first time gamers. also, anything relatively low stress, like no time limits with harsh consequences. i know you said you have a ps5, but its library isn't the most beginer friendly. if you've got or will get a switch, animal crossing and stardew valley were mentioned here, and are good ideas. stakes, and although animal crossing is 3d, it controls like a topdown 2d game. sidescroller platformers can be okay, but keep in mind old ones. also on switch with nintendo online, you guys can explore a pretty good selection of classic games of varying difficulties. even if you don't play all the way through most of them, they're a good exploration of a lot of games. but in that mix, i would recommend super mario world and legend of zelda a link to the past. zelda would be especially great for someone new, but also wanting something more exciting than animal crossing of stardew. super mario world 2 yoshi's story is also fantastic. if you must stick to ps5, then the common suggestion is generally astro's playroom. it's free with the console and a very forgiving, relatively easy platformer. it's still a 3d platformer, so if someone has never played games before, it'll take some getting used to. but at least it's a chill enough one that it's good to learn with. if you're willing to pay for the more expensive psn subscription, then you've got access to a pretty huge classics libraryback catalogue of games that will give a lot of options to explore. playstation in general doesn't cater too much to brand new gamers, but especially if you dive into some of the classics, there are a lot of platformers that are worth it and will at least make the learning curve enjoyable. also, stardew valley i believe is available for ps5."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,to start at deep end thats accessible id say 2d hollow knight. for easy and into harry potter then legacy even if its not the best game imo. my gf played overcooked and it takes 2 but she didnt grow from those games. then when she got into cod she wasnt great but the harder of the game got her to be better with camera. she also loved what remains of edith finch but these arent common game games. give her something youd play and see if she likes it. her genre could be stardew slow type game or she could really enjoy the fast paced fps even if not good at them like payday 2. my gf got into survival games since she can go mostly at her own pace and is task oriented. plus its pve. so things like raft and subnautica she may not be great at but she has tons of fun and gets scared and such and surprised at the simplest things so could be nice. also deep rock galactic is very friendly
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"an mmo might be helpful to start with. they generally have free trials for newbies and the tutorials at the beginning will help her get used to a lot of the skills regular gamers take for granted navigating a ui, camera controls, movement, etc. then you can also be there with her to help her if she gets stuck or needs some backup while learning the ins and outs of combat. many will also have some crafting to get a feel for some of the prominent aspects of cozy games. if that ends up being more her thing, youll be able to narrow your search down to another genre. ffxiv is a pretty one, but there are a lot of options to choose from at first. lotr and swtor look a bit older, but the combat styles are simpler and a lot of the skills learned there will carry over to other games. if you want to go super simple to get a feel for things, wizard 101 is still active and while many adults still play it, the game is marketed as family friendly. you likely wont have to worry about as many uncomfortable interactions with other players there as you would in some other online multiplayers. as a note be patient and ask lots of clarifying questions when you can! she will likely not know the terminology needed to explain in detail what she likesdislikes about whatever games you introduce her to. i dont like the fights for a particular game could mean i dont like combat games at all but it could also mean shes not into turn based games, she prefers ranged vs melee roles, or she finds a 3rd person view during combat to be less overwhelming. let her know this will be a bit of trial and error as well. it can be very frustrating to try something new and thinking shes doing something wrong when in reality the game just might not be to her liking. shell figure out her gaming preferences over time, but that comes from trying games that you both end up loving and end up hating."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"portal 2. fairly chill game in terms of stakes no huge action scenes to get through, teaches the basic controls of fps games, has a great story that is actually very funny and has a coop mode that is very fun."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"this is so true. i wanted to ease my wife into gaming so i thought that a walking simulator would be a pretty harmless place to start. holy shit it was so frustrating though lol, simple concepts like push stick up to walk forward had to be learned and did not come to her easily. i would say something like go look at this desk and what should take 5 seconds would take 30. she got better with time and practice but it was really eye opening to see how much we have to learn first in order to play games. i was playing wolfenstein 3d when i was like 4 years old so gaming has been second nature to me my whole life."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"yup. there's a youtuber whose name i can't remember . who made some videos about this with his nongamer wife. he pointed out that even something as basic as using spacebar to jump didn't come naturally to her as she just wasn't used to it, whereas people who have been gaming a bit immediately pick it up. same with things like crouching, opening inventory while walking, hell even just using wasd to move can be weird to people who don't really game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"yes, movement and aim at the same time are a big challenge for beginning gamers. everyone i've ever introduced to playing a 3d game for the first time has really struggled with that at first. it can also be really headachenausea inducing at first too for new players. they will be moving in weird ways they aren't expecting, theyre probably looking at weird parts of the screen while moving, etc. finding games that limit some aspect of that at first will help, so they aren't overwhelmed. it's easier to add looking around if movement already feels fairly natural."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i downloaded this game called gris off gamepass for my girlfriend. its beautiful, you can move as slowly through the game as you want to, and a sensory experience in side scrolling. she has basically very little fine motor patterning which why would she? so its perfect for her"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"something that doesnt require a lot of skill either. i cant tell you how many people quit video games due to the controls and not the actual story, its unfortunate. id start with mario on the switch or something"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,so something like doom eternal
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,rinworld is a good choice with point and click controls.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"this. portal. it teaches players the use of fps controls, without having to fight against enemies. plus the puzzles are fantastic, voice acting is top notch and it's hilarious. plus it's short and portal 2 is ready when she's finished!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i feel like breath of the wild would actually be a decent 3d game to let them mess around in, but even still there is a lot going on. probablem is you need to balance accessibility with something interesting. 2d scroller easy, but maybe not really what they are coming for. vr experience? but expensive. minecraft? maybe too open. definitely games that guide them around is best. something with story, and a story difficulty. definitely not a console shooter, hard to aim without auto, nevermind for a newbie. rpgs? turn based? depends on the person at the end of the day."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,watching my girlfriend use two joysticks at the same time is painful. it's like watching a child learn a language for the first time. definitely better to get someone started on a 2d game or a top down gave like animal crossing or stardew valley.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"when my mom saw me playing sonic colors when it first came out, she asked how i knew to immediately move right when a side scrolling 2d level started. that made me realize just how many assumptions about gamers games can really make."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-07,"exactly. started them on ocarina of time just to get them used to aiming movement. then fun story games, low intensity rpgs but still had romance. now they can play cod and other high intensity games. very proud of them. when they aren't playing stardew valley, they can keep up with the best of em. if only they would play helldivers 2 instead of referring to it as that just looks stressful"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,stardew is always the correct answer
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,its a good game but i feel like the game has to be 3d so she can learn more universal mechanics
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,yeah theres only 6 inputs. 4 for movement. 1 to interact and 1 to open inventory there is the alt function on weapons but thats non essential

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"there are some games that are just so unbelievably good and genredefining that you can safely recommend them to nongmers and know theyll enjoy it. that list is pretty shory  imo, theres only three grand theft auto, skyrim, and absolutely stardew valley"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,yea the oldies like ocarina of time are really good for getting into gaming
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,zelda probably isnt as beginner friendly as the other games probably start with 2d mario games before anything else
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i agree with this. these are meant to be beginner games, and they can also be enjjoyed by veterans"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,absolutely this. my wife doesnt game and got utterly addicted to this
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,fully agree. i've seen portal recommended many times in other games for beginners threads and it always baffles me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"yeah, i thought portal 1 would be good for my girlfriend to get into first person games, but there were a lot of parts i had to do for her and at some point she got so motion sick she had to throw up"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"it's definitely not a great suggestion for some one brand new to gaming. however, portal was my first km game years ago and i felt it did a great job at teaching the player the mechanics and having 80 or more of the game have essentially no time limit allows the player to really take their time and experiment with how everything works. compared to other more action oriented games where not figuring out the controls immediately results in death, frustration, rage quit."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"portal 2 on the other hand has a great tutorial that makes sure you know how to move the camera and such before tackling puzzles and the puzzles themselves have significantly less of the quick, timingrelated stuff. the game was designed to be more accessible than its predecessor."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,it's a mindfuck at times even if you do play games
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"yes, but it gives you an unlimited amount of time to adapt to those circumstances, it doesnt harshly punish you for failure, and your goals are always straight forward. it puts almost no real pressure on you at all, and the rare times it does dealing with turrets for example it only does so for seconds at a time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"and yet, ive never met a non gamer that tried it that didnt have fun."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"if it takes two was created for brand new video game players, the devs failed so spectacularly its crazy. new players have really bad issues with reaction speed, coordination, and genre norms that massively help direct players in situations where lackluster sign posting was used. don't starve together is also terrible, its control scheme is pretty jank, requires alot of knowledge of what to do, and is very time sensitive. i do not think you understand what issue brand new players have."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"it takes two is a wonderful game but i'm always surprised to see people recommend it for absolute beginners, i feel like this would be a really rough time for someone who literally has no experience with games unless they're very patient."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,i knew a fellow pixel would make the correct suggestions.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i have played it takes two with my girlfriend and although she still struggles with using both sticks at the same time, the game is extremely forgiving and she had tons of fun. i recommended the game to at least two other couples, where the girlfriend was not a gamer and heard similar positive experiences. it also has a nice story and it's not completely brain dead as the lego games, which some other people might recommend, so you won't get bored playing with your girlfriend either."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,i second this op! my bf and i loved this game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,also dave the diver is free if you have premium on playstation. its for sure worth a try

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-07,"i've been playing games for a while now, and have no problem with 3d, fps, or open world games. that being said, getting the jumps timed exactly right on the bottles in the bee area of it takes two was stupid hard! my seasoned gamer husband had to take the wheel and it took him multiple tries to get both of our characters across before handing me back the controller. i know i'm not the best gamer so it doesn't bother me too much but i could see that being discouraging to a new gamer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i think it takes two is a terrible game. i played it with my girlfriend and some parts got really frustrating. the game keeps throwing new mechanics at you without ever bringing back the old ones, so every time she got the hang of one, the level ended and there was something new she had to start learning. the main characters were just awful and annoying, and the overarching story was just boring with no suspense, no plot twists, and no explanations. worst of all, the moral of the story seems to be to try and stay together with a person you don't get along with anymore. if you've grown apart and a relationship isn't working anymore, you're not doing anyone any favors by staying together. cherish what you once had and move on."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,mario 64 is not that straight forward. the game has a bunch of mechanics that activate depending on movement direction relative to starting position and you have to manually control the camera most of the time.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"because you can think of video games as having their own language. we, as gamers, know that if you're on pc, the default jump is space x for ps5 and a for xbox and nintendo. someone who has never played games before doesn't know that information we just have ingrained into our brains at this point."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i recently started playing mario 64 online with a friend using the switch's pass n play feature, and even though he's usually better than me at a lot of games we play together he struggled like hell in a lot of areas because of the limited camera angles and unfamiliarity with the game. don't get me wrong, he wasn't garbage, but he struggled a lot and died in places that i didnt think an average gamer would. so i think even for an average gamer if you bring them into a game like mario 64 that they aren't used to playing they'll still struggle without practice. 2d sidescrollers are best to start with to get used to timing, multiple button combinations, controlling momentum, recognizing solutions to problems based on developer intentions and building mechanic combinations like jumping and shooting together, running and jumping while controlling momentum to land on a small platform, etc."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"smb is so underrated for learning video games. the quickest way to learn something in real life is by getting immediate feedback from your mistakes so you dont make them again. within the first few seconds of the game, you learn the rules  okay dont touch moving things, jump over holes, and theres hidden things to find so exploring is encouraged. wait, game over?! i only get 3 tries?! okay better pay attention next time so i can play longer and make progress. the levels also have a clear beginning, middle, and end so it doesnt feel like it goes on forever. i can take a break if i need to and i can incorporate a social element to challenge a friend to go beat my score. someone else mentioned firewatch which has no real feedback mechanism and to me is just a walking simulatorcontrollable movie. i love the game but i dont think it really defines what a video game is  where skill can be leveraged to improve and rewarded. i think smb3 also takes this to the next level. more fun elements like the different suits, p speed, sliding down hills, and a choice which path to take in the overworld giving some sense of agency."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,i always recommend firewatch when this question comes up. it's the perfect game to learn how to use dual sticks on a console controller.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,id recommend firewatch as well. that game is fantastic and simple.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i was going to say pokemon. i started with it, and the older ones are completely 2.5d or top down so you don't have camera controls to deal with like with the newer ones. though there might be others that are better after that, but pokemon is a fine game to start someone out on."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"maybe it would be easier to start with a 2d game that uses wasd, that way you dont have to worry about controlling the camera at the same time. afterwards switching to a 3d game should hopefully be easier, because you only need to learn camera movement. something like terraria, ori and the blind forest, a short hike, stardew valley, factorio. most roguelikes are also 2d with wasd, like binding of isaac and hades, but theyre probably a bit too hard to start with."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i disagree  it requires basic familiarity with controls and 3dness the parent mentions. things like doublejump and its timing are completely alien to a nongamer and it take two doesnt really explain it the same way, say, a mario title does. if its gonna a be a platformer, id go for mario wonder or odyssey. pretty much any of the lego games are beginnerfriendly too and all multiplayer"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,it's good bc you always play together but that's it. my wife has problems just cobtrolling a camera so the more hectic situations are quite hard for her.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"my gf played rct and similar as a kid but was not a gamer as an adult. she started with stardew valley and today, years later, builds spreadsheets for it, has come home with a 5page printed and formatted outline of valheim and palia tasks she made at work, is a mongolia domination victory expert in civ vi and plays ow2 with a top 500 stack lmao"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,it takes two 1010 would recommend. only downside is there aren't a lot of modern games like it. so finding the game to play next is a pain.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"id wait until they get more experience before starting it takes two. my wife has become acclimated to the controller, but she still struggled during many sections of this game. a total newbie would have a tough time. for complete beginners, it is better to start them with games that have very few buttons."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,did you break up because you made them play overcooked after?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"check out the stardew valley expanded mod if you get the chance. it's really well made and nothing feels out of place at all despite it adding alot of new content. the main dev of it even got hired by concerned ape to work on the official game, its that good"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"just stick with 2 axis controls as a beginner, once she gets the hang of it then move on to 3 axis. new gamers have to learn how to navigate the world and use their xy buttons. a 3d world, not only adds the z axis, but also camera controls as well  although camera controls are much more intuitive now compared to even 15 years ago, its not really intuitive for new gamers"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,id say animal crossing is a safe bet if you know theyll like stardew. similar vibes
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,bro if youre on ps5 it comes with astrobot. its the simplest most enjoyable pure fun platformer. the haptics and controls are great and the levels are vibrant and easy to get through.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,highly recommend sack boy. i play it with my gf too and is a great game for beginners that you two can play together
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"any of the lego games are great entries, like lego marvel or lego star wars. they have coop, infinite lives, and good puzzles. my wife isn't a big gamer but we are currently playing through lego marvel superheroes, and it offers something for both of us i can always hunt collectibles in the levels if i get ahead or she needs to solve a puzzle."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"id do research into games that are more narrative focused and don't require a ton of skill in their gameplay. you have to remember that even things like the button layout on controllers is something that needs to be learned. this approach also allows the transition in the way the media is enjoyed to be less stark since going from passive media to active media can be offputting for some. i can't recommend any specific games because i don't know the interests of the person in question, but you do so i hope you're able to set them up well."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"i would say life is strange is a perfect one. the controls are simple, though movement can be somewhat clunky, but it doesn't matter because it's not an action game. the protagonist is a woman, so that might be good for her, and the story is super engaging and will suck you in. then after she's got he controls down for that, maybe try last of us, which is a similar story based game but with more action and combat mixed in. if you haven't played life is strange it will be a treat for you to watch and follow along with the story, too. just try hard not to be a backseat driver and let her do her own thing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-07,"ps5? easy elden ring obviously. lol jokes aside maybe overcooked on pc? it's a pretty fun game for multiplayer. although my own gf said she hates overcooked cause it's stressful and she has enough stress from her job.  but you definitely want to start her on something simple, easy to pick up and fun. after that you can introduce her to more story driven games."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"find out what games she has played and what intereststopics she enjoys in other entertainment eg films, books and see if you can get a pc version that matches the style. eg monopoly, scrabble, chess, catan, mousetrap, are all available free somewhere and once she gets the idea of it being a medium you control with the mousekeyboard or gamepad you can send her towards the rabbit hole that fits her genre preferences. in terms of complexity and immersion let her decide after getting her handeye coordination working on the simpler games, if the game requires complex thought to proceed or an immersion storyline then it could put her off simply from having to stop and look at what her hands are doing. fighting games and racing games are usually good to start with if she wants to jump in at the deeper end as their focus is on speeding up hand eye coordination without being able to look at your hands too long, while platformers and boardgames are better suited to the slower learners that want to perfect their strategy and timing in game. tldr don't give her a story focused game until she has gotten to grips with the controls"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,i died to penguins on my longest run. who knew they could be so vicious?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"agreed. i did the same thing. i thought the whole purpose of the game was to be a kind of bonding experience with your nongamer so. nope! one stick moves, one stick has free control of the camera unless you're hitting the target button, jump, double jump, ground pound by jumping and hit crouch while in the air, hold this button to run and that button to crouch and a different button to interact with stuff unless you're running in which case it becomes roll. . . pretty basic stuff for me, but my wife was absolutely finger twisted. took us over 2 hours to beat the vacuum cleaner boss, at which point she tapped out."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"was your wife put off by the difficulty at all? i know it's not a super easy game, but i think part of what makes it good is that you struggle together"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"yeah. my wife doesn't play too much aside from sims or party animals, but it takes two was a great game for both of us. we took forever on some bosses, but had a blast. oh and party animals is also a nice game to play."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"no problem. it's a good starting point because it's a chill and relaxing game, you make your own goals and engage with the parts of the game you want. there's very little that you can do wrong and those consequences are often minor like loss of money and energy. it's a very casualfriendly game while still providing options that entertain most gamers"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,it can be! ive seen a few other people say stuff like stardew valley and it takes two! both really fun games  have yall watched the fallout show together? maybe get on 76?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"oh definitely. sensory overload, but sometimes that's a good thing. once they understand the most basic how to use the sticks to move character and camera, the tutorial in story mode teaches the rest of the basic controls and is very forgiving, or you can start online with them and teach them yourself with even lower stakes and absolute freedom to start wherever ya want. the openworld sandbox let's them play and experiment and fail and learn with no pressure or consequence, and allows them chance to experiment and try different things entirely on their whims. if my idiot little brother could figure out vice city at like, 8yo, i'm sure gta v is doable with even the smallest amount of patience and desire. that said, there's a reason it was my last suggestion. still stand by katamari or lbp as perfect beginner games, but not knowing the new person made it a little hard to help, so i wanted to throw out a curve ball argument for something different."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"not a bad choice, but i mean like theres a lot things you have to be knowledgeable about for the most part. most games these days require you to invest some time and learning into them but i just recommended the fps genre because its really just point and shoot."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,sackboy is such a great game for couples where one isn't much of a gamer. it takes two is slightly more advanced but still a great one for one to teach another about gameplay mechanics.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"life is strange is a good choice. you'd have time to get used to moving your character and camera without urgency. and since the experience is primarily about the story, the appeal isn't a far cry from a movie or a tv show."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"idk, the frustration is not the difficulty of the actual game but the mechanics. brand new gamers do not have a muscle memory of moving controls and the camera. they will be running into walls and spinning in circles and looking down to see what button is what every 3 seconds. i played it when i first got into games and my hubs would be entirely done with a section and waiting for me while i was still spinning and trying to find out where the heck i needed to even go.  not even mentioning the tons of other mechanics it introduces fast af. its a super fun game and i loved it, but i would say get the movement and camera mechanics solidified before playing. imo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"someone like op's gf should not start with it takes two. it's an incredibly game, but you need already be familiar with movement and look mechanics and other game related base mechanics or you're going to get frustrated and not be able to enjoy the game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-05-06,"unless you have a pc from 2005, emulators are not laggy, and any console controller can pair to a pc with bluetooth. i have had 0 issues playing nintendo emulators on my pc. in fact, the emulator experience is even better than the console, even for the switch. i just move the emulator window to my tv and then sit on the couch playing with my ps5 controller. my xbox and switch controllers work too, but i prefer the ps5 controller. although i would make sure to use the switch controllers for new players playing a nintendo game so the buttons match. nintendo games are an awesome choice for someone new to gaming, and an emulator is a great way to do that. you shouldnt make claims about something you are not very knowledgeable in. i recommend trying out some emulators and getting some experience with it."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-20,thanks for the tip! i actually posted it there as well.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-20,"fun fact the original tetris had an algorithm to send the blocks that the player rotated the most, more often. since the coveted long piece only had 2 orientations and was often used to clear several rows at once in only one of the orientations, players didnt rotate it often and thus, got fewer of the pieces. so if you are playing og tetris, called tengen tetris the soviet mind game i believe, and want long pieces, rotate the shit out of them!"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-21,"that ain't og tetris though. og tetris was written in pascal i believe. or some other computer language that let you make shapes out of keyboard characters. yeah, i think it's pascal. also that algorithm is a very good example of how randomness works in video games. i always get triggered when someone says it's just random in a video games and then go on a long preach about rng algorithms that start with well, actually... . i usually cite the original zelda and how speedrunners manipulated rng and how heart drops from enemies were not random at all and were determined by your actions."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-21,that might actually make things worse. the impurities in the water stay behind and can cause corrosion.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-21,"i'm guessing that's an exception though. the majority of video games will just use a random number generator that takes an input seed from the computer's internal clock, and then use this to generate some pseudorandom numbers, which is as close to truly random as you can get."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-21,"that's not an exception at all, because they both use the same or similar algorithm, one takes internal clock the other the number of rotations as the seed number. the end result is the same. you can manipulate internal clock as well as the number of rotations. basically if x5y then it doesn't really matter where x comes from because the formula is the same."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-21,"yep, exactly, but instead of x5, it's some very complicated pseudorandom number generating functionhttpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikipseudorandomnumbergenerator, which generates numbers that are basically indistinguishable from truly random numbers, at least in the context of videos games. i'm sure you could exploit this in some games if you somehow worked out what the seed was and knew the algorithm not sure how you'd do this with the internal clock, but that doesn't really make it any less random."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"what? the metro series are way more popular than stalker, they've sold triple what stalker have. exodus alone has double the players of the whole stalker franchise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"but op question isnt about one most popular game but about a list of the popular games, so stalker and metro could be mentioned together"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,australia
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,yeah. but mount and blade is pretty big.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,a lenda do heri. mas esse s  famoso no brasil.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"ah you got me, it was my first exposure to gaming. loved it!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"yeah, youre right. sad but true. why do you say its probably good for the games industry though?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"the uk is a sovereign nation. scotland is a country. i was making a throwaway joke, but clearly keyboard warriors do not allow jokes in this dojo"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,omg why are people allergic to throwaway remarks. did the wink emote not indicate to you that i was not being serious?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"apparently a laughing and winking emoji was not enough of an indicator that i might have not been serious, and was not enough to stop people jumping on the comment like i'd offended their mum. oh well"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"just don't tell em, we got you bro!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,pugb started there
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,didn't realise terraria and overwatch 2 were now on the top 10. my mistake. that's quite a recent change.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"haha, fair enough brother."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,its no problem. i was just curious myself as i knew of the devs were dutch and the other dev didnt sound like he was swedish. p
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"oh sorry to clarify they look outside not through windows, instead through the holes in their crumbling walls"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,didn't mean to imply you're wrong. i was wondering if we have other studios to be proud of?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"yeah, that makes sense!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-29,"everyone makes fun of ea as where good gaming companies go to die. dont play sports games at all actually have no idea if they make good games or not. presumably they are doing something right or they would have died out a long time ago. actually applied to be a playtester there about 20 years ago, didnt get hired im sure in part because i had never played any of their sports games."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"last stalker game was released 15 yearts ago. and you are seriously comparing it to metro franschise? among the gaming community stalker is way more popular, has mods, memes and entire subculture related to this game. metro is just prettier version of the stalker with the similar plot."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"okay, someone could just mention other ukrainian games. i could also mention cossacks, for example.. honestly, i just named the most popular ukranian franchise."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,i picked up armello and obliteracers in an aus bundle a while back. both solid games from small studios here also powerslide from back in the late 90s was a banger of a racing game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"it had some amazing games, no judgment here."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,it's good for gaming that it's global  all the different cultures involved make for a much richer gaming world than if it was dominated by one or two countries. still wish the uk did a bit more than it does tho!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"well it wasn't a good one. a good one would have been they are british when they win, scottish when they lose."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,nah i get it and it's not that serious. idk. some people get really touchy about that stuff.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-30,"nhl 95, nhl 96, and nhl 98 are core gaming memories for me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"it's not way more popular. it has asmall, active community of its own, but there is no world in which stalker franchise is more popular than metro. it's a simple numbers game. you may not see it that way if you are very absorbed in the stalker series and the community, but from the outside looking in, stalker is extremely niche. metro is slightly less so, and has sold considerably more."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"yes, that would have been better"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,pugb.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,wasnt the studio which made doom and wolfenstein based in ireland?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-10-28,"stalker franchise sold about 15 million copies, according to wikipedia. metro exodus sold 8.5 millions, other games from the franchise had much lower numbers, so the overall sales are comparable."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-09,"the news that the devs wont be working on new ones actually made me kind of hopeful. the world and art style of these games is uniqueterrifyingbeautiful in all the right ways, and could easily be expanded. but the gameplay sucks imo. i died countless times in both games falling off ledges because i couldn't tell where my character was in relation to the ledge, and i nearly gave up completely in the second game in multiple parts that i couldn't progress for various gameplay reasons. if a different team takes over to continue the world while redoing the gameplay, it could be a really great series in all aspects"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-27,"the main thing is that there should not be the simplest screamers, when some unknown garbage jumps out at you just like that. the atmosphere should be scary first of all"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-27,"inside and limbo was good, ln 12 too. more good games like these are good, right?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,then u have shady part of me
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-04-28,do they need to be horror? far lone sails has similar gameplay to those. side scrolling 3d puzzle solving with heavy focus on atmosphere. it's great.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"my vote is hollow knight first and outer wilds second. hollow knight is longer and more replayable, while you can really only play outer wilds properly once. theyre both superb, though. get both ifwhen you can."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"outer wilds is one of my favorite games of all time after playing it. i wish i could wipe my memory to reexperience it all over again. i haven't played the others unfortunately so i can't give the input you are specifically looking for, but i had to throw a bone to outer wilds."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,hollow knight. definitely one of the best game experience i had. haven't played little nightmares though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"outer wilds is one of the best experiences in gaming, i didnt like hollow knight too much"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,little nightmares 1 and 2 are super fun at night
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"didnt play much of outer worlds. not really my jam. but i think hollow knight is the most bang for your buck. i really dont think you need other music either. hk has a really solid soundtrack and is perfect nighttime vibes. gameplay is really fun too. bosses are great and there is a lot to dosee. be forewarned, though. its tough. little nightmares is a fun little adventure too with satisfying traversal and puzzle solving. immersive and atmospheric too. my wife and i do a yearly halloween play through of 1 and 2. my vote goes to hk, though. for both your personal specifications and for general raw gameplay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,well playing little nightmares and hollow knight at the moment its a prferenz thing hollow for the exploration and little nightmares for horror and puzzles havent played outer wilds
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"i wouldn't play outer wilds or little nightmares at night, tbh.  hollow knight would be my recommendation. it's beautiful, the music is indeed great. it's even not too hardcore."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,ori ftw
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,u should try out road 96httpsyoutu.beefhu0b2cpg

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"i dont think these posts are against the rules of this sub, but i would direct those questions anyway to rshouldibuythisgame , they'll probably be of better help"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"little nightmares is too short imo, i beat it same day in like five hours and only that long because im just kinda bad with problems solving."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,did you play little nightmares?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,is it a hard game?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"not too hardcore? dude have you done the pantheon? i've platinumed it and that was my last trophy, it took me nearly 6 months 3 of those were dedicated to absolute radiance"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,why you would not play outer wilds at night?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,literally the hardest platinum trophy of my life. hollow knight is seriously hardcore... there is a reason people compare it to dark souls
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,thanks
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,its a much smaller game than the other two which is why if you care about longevity it should be the last you play of those
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"hollow knight gives you the most moneyreplay value. outer wilds had a more meaningful storyexperience imo, and little nightmares 12 are fun n creepy indiesbut they are very short."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"nah, i haven't. it was never really big on my radar."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,outer wilds is kinda walking simulator. it has no battle system and i met almost no platforming here. you just exploring little star system and finding out how to explore it more from gameplay perspective.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"it gets tough but it's a mystery game so it's not impossible. it presents all the information you need to solve puzzles, some of them just require some out of the box thinking or other puzzle pieces to understand what to do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"no, i tried the pantheon and decided it was not worth my time and that it could make me hate the game i loved. i meant the story part of the game including the good ending."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-27,"i feel like they do a great job of letting you feel like youre done at most reasonable skill levels. it is totally valid to just be able to beat the hollow knight, only beat radiance, or go all out and beat the final pantheon. no shame in only going as far as you want to, so it doesnt need to be as hardcore as it could be if you dont want it to"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"not op but i have this very primal fear whenever i'm playing a space game, maybe because of its sheer scale and.. emptiness. thinking about how it actually is out there is a bit anxiety inducing. you can guess how i felt when a certain mechanic started. it's so much of a pain that i actually couldn't play ow more than like an hour before i completely dropped it, even though it's exactly my type of game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"last horror game i played at night was clive barker's undying. it wasn't the most pleasant experience, so now i tend to play horrors or games with disturbing elements by daylight"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"my bad, yeah the main game is art"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-02-26,"i admit, pantheon is a cool part of the game, not some senseless gauntlet, i know that. and i applaud your dedication to get to the truest of endings, really. i just not in a mood for additional suffering currently."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,"not sure about the coop support. i'm usually for it, but one of the cool things about the last game was how independent the other character was. you didn't have to hold their hands and would even save you during some of the chases. obviously it's pretty much all scripted, but i don't really see them being able to do the same with a coop partner, or even an ai character that has to be joinable at any time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,"eyoooo! i am so hyped for this. i loved the first, liked the second, and i hope the new devs do this justice."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,so the journey didn't end??
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,is it going to be coop only?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-23,same but looks really good. bit sad that the old characters aren't returning but hopeful for a shocker at the end like the other two games. hopefully it's as good as it looks and maybe have more games that tie the characters together. especially considering what happened at the end of little nightmares ii.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,i'm hoping for both  either ai if you want to play alone  or coop if you want to play with a friend. i hope they looked at it takes two for inspiration of coop though obviously not split screen.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,it looks like it might have coop too! the visuals look amazing and i'm glad the big people from the first game are back.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,i hope the series continues. the first sequel was amazing!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-08-24,no idea but probably not.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"yeah, little nightmares didn't grab me either. it's a beautiful game, but it just didn't hold my attention beyond the art style. the control was too floaty and the puzzles too simple. i stuck it out for a an hour or two, but eventually just moved on to something else. as i've grown older i've felt less and less like i need to stick with any game that isn't completely sucking me in. i have an overwhelming backlog so it isn't like i'm hurting for things to play. why waste my time with things i'm only engaging with to check off a list?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"once, for dragon's dogma. most of the time if i don't like i game from the outset i don't return to it. most recent game i dropped for a second time is the evil within. a game that makes it too easy to be killed multiple times right in the beginning is not my idea of a fun time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"i tried witcher 3 twice before it finally clicked in my brain. the combat system was like taking turns  you couldn't just go brute force and attack. you have to attack, attack, defend, attack, dodge, use a sign, attack, dodge etc. you also have to use everything in your inventory to give yourself an edge  potions, bombs, signs, blade oils. once i understood that, i enjoyed the combat more  could focus on enjoying the story instead of dreading the upcoming fight."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,i dropped rdr2 bc my controller has a couple buttons that stopped working and am too poor to buy another controller for the time being
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,the game is more fun to think about than actually play if i'm honest.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,yep same with me. tried it about 5 times across console and pc. i just dont like playing it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"first 3 hours are boring and slow, once you past that, it's one of the best games. you really need to keep going."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,ive tried it a bunch as well. just never hooked me.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,same. restarted about 3 times. its such a hassle to finish the first part in the ice! plus playing it on 30fps in the ps5 does not help my case at all. i cant seem to invest more than an hour into it. its too slow for my taste.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"it's absolutely crazy how much of a slog, bogged down by annoying little sim details, and full of needlessly long animations this game is compared to the original. it's practically night and day. i just can't get into it. it's not automatically more fun or immersive for everything to take forever and be super arduous, no matter what people say."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,you have to get to st. denis. at that point the game exploded in quality for me. i kept going through to rhodes and would get bored but seriously after rhodes the story becomes phenomenal.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"i finished rdr2 just so i can reply to comments like this. for some people the game is a masterpiece, but for me it was a slog. the dissonance between the me and arthur was so large the story had no impact and the way they limit you on missions makes it feel on rails. and the camp is so slow investing in side characters is a chore. if you loved it i envy you, i really do. so much work went into that game but for me it was painful, and i only finished it so no one could say it pays off if i keep playing. for me it doesn't."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,yeah took me 4 tries too. i got chapter 4 on my 3rd try and dropped it. starting up again at chapter 4 helped. i normally restart and get bogged down in the early chapters. my advice is to not restart. just start from where you left off next time. when i finished the game i was able to say i enjoyed it but not to the same extent as rdr1 or the gta series.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-17,dropped it so many times first off its ass on xbox one. on pc its fine but it takes a long time to get things done lmao

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-15,"it was for me for awhile until i reached the next place. the first part of the game is nothing like the rest. after playing the rest of the game, i think it's supposed to be sort of like the tutorial stage?"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"100 this. the souls games are a nightmare to get into until they click with you. i spent a good hour going at the graveyard thinking that's just how the game was. my 2nd or 3rd try, i finally found the way you're meant to go, and couldn't get past the one boss. probably gave it 5 or so tries and just couldn't get into it. it wasn't until i played elden ring that the souls games finally clicked and funnily enough, ds1 is my favorite game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,i really liked everything about the game but thought the combat was a bit janky. i think i restarted the game once and finally got used to the combat. the 2nd feels much better in combat.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,this. mass effect was so boring to me and it took me til years after mass effect 3 came out before i finally went back to give it another chance and ended up playing through the series. i don't normally like rpgs but once it got it's hooks in i couldn't stop.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"same. three attempts. probably 2 hours each time. just doesn't do it for me. part of it is i hate walking somewhere close to where i'm supposed to be and it's like lol you're level 6 and this thing is level 14 get dunked on and remember to come back in 7 hours, but if you come back in 12 hours it'll be so easy it's not fun. if you're gonna have leveled areas, do like fallout and have them be gradual and based on distance to the starting area or something. but random pockets where enemy levels wildly vary from minute to minute? no thanks"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,removed
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"yup, i almost quit because of the combat. glad i didnt tho, because its one of the best games i've played."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,true but the story and the world building does take the heavy lifting for the most part
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"weren't they worse originally? the first time i tried it, the controls felt very sluggish and unresponsive, but soon after they released a major patch that added a new control style you could choose from the options menu, and it made a big difference."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"the game plays pretty bad overall. i remember playing monster hunter in high school and a friend recommended me witcher 3 since he said that the fights were more interesting  better. to me the controls just feel like assassins creed odyssey, just boring spins and weightlessness."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,witcher 1 is extremely rough euro jank. theres a reason they are remaking it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"same here, except that i finished a single run of ds1 beforehand but the souls games didnt click with me until elden ring."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"the hunters are player filters. they have seemingly infinite stamina, way more health, and can parry you. the first time i reached the turret hunter, he was one hit from killing me and he back stepped off the ledge. needless to say bloodborne is my favorite fromsoft game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"that's it, exactly. i was watching a video last night that suggested that the tree sentinel in elden ring serves the function of informing new players that they have to figure out for themselves what they can and can't handle, right from the start."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,i picked up dark souls completely blind back in the day. i also had a rough time and went to the graveyard first before putting it down and starting over again a few months later. i dont think reputation had much to do with it. i eventually got the grasp of it when i noticed that tiny staircase that led to the undead burg that i had missed in my first play through.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"you start the game as a level 1 pyromancer the only class that starts at level 1 and you complete the game without ever leveling up. other kinds of upgrades are fair game, but your low stats mean that you can use limited equipment, and your low health pool means that the margin for error is greatly reduced. it really breathes new life into the game. highly recommended."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"i started subnautica for the 1st time not long ago and dropped it for that exact reason, couldn't find what i was looking for just stuff i didn't need curious to know what changed that 3rd time you tried it."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"for real. it didn't feel like a zelda game for me until the first divine beast, like 20 hours in. but as soon as that hit, i was all in."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"my friend was a but of a godsend on that front, he just told me to explore and keep every item that i found then before i went into act 2 he had me stream my game and we went through every character, re specced them and equipped them with what i had. suddenly the game became a walk in the park because he's a dnd guy and he knew way more about the stats and gear than i do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"same. my first two attempts at bg3 were on ps5 and i just couldn't handle it. i would gain so many new spells and abilities, only for them to be lost somewhere in the menus for me to forget about. i love the little hot bar if that's what it is called on pc. being able to glance down and see all of your abilities makes combat way more engaging. i feel like i'm actually making use of all that my individual squad members have to offer."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,i played through dd twice. once to romance that witch girl who lived in the forest and once for the princess.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"i don't think it ever did. i just pushed through one time and that was it. once you start getting the crew together and going to different planets it feels better. if you get to the mako gameplay on the random planets you might hit a speed bump again, but weirdly i didn't mind it. if you can, push through because me2 is one of the greatest games of all time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,yes! the combat in 23 is much better but i wish they'd have such with the overheating for ammo instead of moving to ammo drops. just a nitpick though.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,yup! this is basically the experience i'm seeing from everyone.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"i get all bunched up and then put it away for long enough that i have to do a restart to relearn the game. i get a little further each time. so far, ive done this six or seven times."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,nice. yeah i'm currently stuck on one of the final bosses so i went to adventure mode and damn they really load you up when you do those maps.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,oh thanks bro! i'm able to keep things under control until next time lmao medication really helped and just gave up on fixating on unresolved shit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"it's a very similar vibe, a little more industrial to fit the theme of the game but still lots of the same elements."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"in rdr2 if something looks interesting. it is. chimney rock? try climbing to the top. abandoned shack in the woods, go look inside. etc. etc."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"yea, i had a little of that when first starting. modifying the aiming sensitivity helped with the aiming, but the physics based movement definitely had a clumsily moving in sand quality. it is much better on pc at 60, but thats still not something consoles can do."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"i am glad and also sad that it's not just me. that is exactly the feeling i have. that i've done something incorrectly or have missed some key thing or feeling about the game. even if the game is going really well, i may have the thought to restart. once i think it, it rattles around in my head until i do it. that really sucks about the books and movies. i am good about those. i think movies are too short and books are a more significant time investment than games. ocd truly is whack."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"same bro, plus the 30 fps just kills it for me"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,i gave up at around 40 hours. i loved rdr back in the day but the gameplay didn't evolve enough for part 2 and i just cant with the ancient creaky gta mission structure anymore.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"yeah, then you just dont like the game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,same.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"mine too, what an incredible story and game. never liked the main gta games but loved rdr2."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"there is an option in the settings to scale up enemies based on your level, so all content keeps some level of challenge if thats something you want to try. this setting doesn't downscale afaik, so you do still have to come back later if your level is to low"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"the combat is bad, and the rpg portion of the game is atrocious. the stories are good though, and the quests. personally dislikes the style of everything as well though, so i couldn't get into it despite trying like 6 times over 80 hours. kept telling myself that many people can't be wrong. but yes, they can. opinions be opinion, you can like something despite flaws, but it really hasn't been all that long since that game's many shortcomings were ok to acknowledge. it had the blind praise bg3 hadhas."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"i didn't realise how bad the combat was until i played it immediately after a long session of dark souls 3. it broadly feels like the same kind of system with blockparrydodge however it feels so floaty and delayed in comparison, it's extremely sluggish and without those cool slo mo executions it would probably be even more awful."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"yeah the tree sentinel does a pretty good job of that. youve just been told you need to go to stormveil which you can see prominently in the distance, and the sentinel, while in your way, is in a big open area so its easy to see you can just go around it. in dark souls 1 youre just told to find two bells and the graveyard is a pretty obvious path, possibly even more so than the one youre supposed to take."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,oh wow that sounds amazing. thank you for the details. i don't think i have nearly the skill but i might look up a vid to see how it looks!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,just got lucky i guess. i didn't struggle as much to find seamoth parts and was able to find a cave that gave a lot of silver and copper.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,i didn't even know romance was a thing in that game i've gotten to the first big city did abit around it then drop it out if frustation.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,i then ended up playing like 40 hours of mass effect andromeda trying to recapture that magic but it just wasn't there...

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"i think for me i dislike witcher and bg3 is okay the main issue is that both games are way too easy, even on the hardest difficulty"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"i agree with your sentiments for both witcher 3 and bg3 tbh, ive hit act 3 on bg3 multiple times and just cant be bothered to finish it. act 3 is such a slog it loses all momentum and fun for me"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,i didn't even see the rightside path my first time.. it just blended in with the cliff. hell i found the secret chest area before i found that path... definitely think they could have made it just a little bit more obvious.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,well i did liked the game so i'll def keep trying
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,dragon's dogma's romance is hilarious. what a weird system. the upside is that i got to give my college roommate unending ribbing since he played my version of the game and somehow managed to get symone as his beloved.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"which is a shame because i thought the combat in andromeda was so good, but i just couldn't get attached to the story or characters."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"funny story, another redditor recommended that gun so i looked it up in the wiki and went to go get it. the cipher rod needed to craft it was not there. i thought, maybe i picked it up in the chaos? looked through my inventory. nothing. so i looked at a video to see if i was really in the right spot, and yeah, the item is not there for me. looked it up and i guess it's a known bug that some items aren't there. i also encountered other locations that were odd because it looked like items should be there and it was completely empty, so i figured i was just missing a secret or two. as far as i know, the only way to get the cipher rod is to reroll the campaign since the labyrinth can't be an adventure map."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-13,"yea the controls are janky as fuck , shit is ass, maybe when it first came out i would have played it but now with the current games and shit is hard"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,"first playthrough i didnt bother with the crafting or potions, so the combat was somewhat challenging. if you play the game properly, its a breeze."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-12,"that's rough, it wouldn't be so bad if it was something you could pick up outside of the campaign. i rerolled adventure so many times so i could get to the postulants parlour and claim the fae royal armour set that i was convinced it was bugged, the real headache is you need to play through to see if it even spawned in the world as you just don't know. got there eventually though."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-14,yeah i went for an alchemy build off rip to really rp a witcher. little did i know i'd be literally invisible from level 10 i don't remember the level exactly it's been years

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-30,"yes, i really want this game. i hope it's as good as the previous games developed by tarsier studio."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-10-30,yeah the company making the game is competent. until dawn was a straight up masterpiece. plus it looks like tarsiers template and universe are being respected. i worship the first two games i think the first one with its dlc added on is the better of the two.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-07,"it opens up a lot after a few hours, there are a lot of choices in the story, and the dlc really makes it better. it's kind of like if world of warcraft and dragon age had a baby."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-07,oh gotcha. yeah i wanted to buy it recently but it wasnt on the ps5 store for the console but it was still listed on the ps app and on the website. i guess it was delisted on the console due to crashes. huge bummer bc i loved that game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-07,"yeah. i couldn't bring myself to replay rdr2 at 30 fps mostly to not ruin the experience, let alone a game like andromeda. here's hoping the new mass effect game is as good as the originals if it even comes out"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-08,"yeah!!! its got a bit of monotonous grind if you want and all the cool sandbox stuff you expect. honestly , it just fits my life at the moment. i have a full time job and two young kids so dont have the headspace or time for a monster game. i do however have the odd moment to walk around in the desert , shoot cactai and crash a few cars"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-07,"yeah. don't recommend it. all characters are divided in classes which makes them all feel the same. literally quantity over quality. sw3, batman 2, and marvel 1 prob are my favorites"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-07,i'll give it another try in the future. sometimes you just evolve in gaming after some time. first time i played gow2018 i could barely beat sigrun and had to switch to the easiest difficulty. second time i beat her on my second try on the second hardest difficulty. maybe the same applies here
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2025-02-08,are you saying the game is bad just because of it's genre???

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,walking into the sunset endings are my favorite
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"ironically that was my least favorite part of the game, but you do you"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,im making a note here huge success
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"tbh i'm not very good with horror games, i find them way scarier than horror movies. but even tho i was shitting my pants, soma was the first horror game i actually completed from start to end. that's how good the story is lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,imagine going through all that bs just to learn a doggy was causing all that
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,i loved the joker in knight. it was a great way to have him in the game and was a huge part of the storyline and batman's struggle during it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,"ditto. was an amazing game, and i didn't expect to care so much about parker by the end. i too shed a tear."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"same, and i was shook when i accidentally pulled the trigger"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,the cake is a lie
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,bro get the hell out of the comments so nobody spoils it for you! i would pay anything on earth to be able to replay that game without knowing the ending

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,i really want to play it now where can i
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,cause we're gonna shout it loud
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"batmobile. but i don't agree with them. it's just a bit overused, especially for what could have been amazing boss fights. and then the hoops you have to jump through to get the true ending."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,right! like holy shit that game is just breathtaking
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,i don't mind the cutscenes. it's nowhere near as on your face like kingdom hearts 3 is also enjoyed that game but the ending was a giant movie
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,yes
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,i'd recommend it the campaign is a bit short but i liked it. it's basically the spiritual successor to new vegas and a tribute to firefly in one package.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,yup!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,not that great but people overreact
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,"just a cheesy side scrolling platformer from the 16bit era. which doesn't help much, most games then were side scrolling platformers! here's a link to the ending. laughable now. amazing when i was ten! httpsyoutu.beb9zo7x0ggbs"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,it's a platformer with a great story relating to the manhattan project. the levels are puzzles playing on different variations of time manipulation mechanics. the art is all hand drawn and phenomenal.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"the selfie, i guess"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,yeah the story changes in the remake are so bad! the original is perfect in every moment
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"yes, first game i ever beat."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"yes, for me its one of the best stories i have ever played"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,it's an older one. it was one of my favorites as a kid. i need to play through again for the nostalgia hit.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"its on steam for around 20 dollars, worth every last penny"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,definitely

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,yeah
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"completely worth it, in my opinion, despite all the bugs, glitches, and crashes, i think that new vegas is the best designed game ever made, its not my favorite game, but its in the top 5."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,you're lucky to have lots still to experience. enjoy!!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,bt!!!!!!!

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,but the lumas die! the fucking lumas die! aaaah!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,and this plot twist is awesome

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"let's just say it's a brief, but deep, and very nuanced look into human psychology."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,it's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,it actually happens in the second play through. but thats funny seeing a game which was released 20 years ago did this
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,true. it was also a different take on the character. you can notice him being a bit different in knight from asylum and city and that's because it isn't really the joker. it's the version of joker present in batman's mind. it's how bruce knew him when he was alive. and there's also some of bruce's own insecurities present in those hallucinations. the difference was so subtle yet so brilliant and joker was honestly one of the best things about the third game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"the sacrifices he makes that might cause sadness to him but peace to others, i just love that game man"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,can someone describe the ending to me?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,you can do so !like this!.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,how much does it cost
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,my opinion too
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,"same people that did fall out new vegas. ow is a good game. not a aaa game, more like a a or aa. it should be on sale around black friday and its worth playing."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,just dont expect the writing to be anywhere as good.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,"i got pretty turned off by the very linear world design, and pretty subpar writing. it feels more like an incredible polished mod using an older game engine than it does a modern video game."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"a long time ago, i just couldnt figure it out today"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,yep
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,we do what we must because we can
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,yes
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-04,thanks for the help
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,it goes on sale quite often. not sure where you are but it only cost me 12
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,well cant play console games until christ birthday because school but ill check it out
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,alright
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,"thats because it is an older game and amazing for the time, not to mention that it was developed in 13 months, of course they would have to cut corners"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,ok
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,shiver me timbers

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-11-05,makes more sense
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-04,limbo and inside. i believe theyre both available on switch. same sidescrollerminipuzzle concept as little nightmares.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-04,bump for inside and limbo and i personally recommend stela
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-04,hollow knight. indie game too so i think it's pretty cheap.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-04,"it's not like little nightmare but it's an indie game, and i think that might be what you liked about these games, that they offered something different than the norm that comes with aaa games. moonlighterhttpsyoutu.besmw3psp4im"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-04,"never alone is also a good one! not sure if its on the switch, but worth a shot to look up."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-05,thank you! i had a look into these a while ago but didn't think much of them. just had a look into both again and purchased inside. im about 40 minutes in and i am absolutely loving it! thanks for the suggestion  edit grammar
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-05,wow i've never heard of this game. just googled it and it seems to be exactly what im looking for. thank you!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-01-05,"no worries! its a fairly unknown game, but a good one."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,"agree, great game."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,is the pacing better than the first game?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,recently just finished it. genuinely one of the best games i've played in years.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,no u.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,i believe they stated they are done with it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,"when i see a dissenting comment that is downvoted but has no comments, my immediate assumption is that ppl just want to circlejerk about a thing they like and don't want any discussion or opinion exchange."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,what do you mean? the first game didn't have pacing problems
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,tarsier studios developers of little nightmares 1 and 2 are moving on to other ips but bandai namco own the rights to little nightmares and have said that they are still looking to work on the series i think.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-05-03,it spent chapter 1 building the setting and tension. that's not really bad pacing. every other chapter had something going on
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,this is fucking awesome
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,really nice drawing!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,i think i should not be stepping on any creaky floorboards

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,digging that pen and ink style! one of the best and most original games of last year.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,i've had this on my wishlist for a while. i think i want it to be limbo which is maybe why i've not bought it. nice drawing.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,wow
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,great game! loved the sequence near the end with the fat people
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,really good. i've drawn some of the characters from little nightmares myself. loved drawing them for how different and interesting they are. you've got a good style too
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,never played it but it looks fucking good
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,"i wish i had this kind of talent, this is really, really good."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-09,"more people need to play this game, still not quite sure i understand the ending but it was awesome and terrifying and the monster design was really cool and inventive."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,thanks!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,have you played 'inside'?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,"oddly, i watched a play through because i was so skeptical it could be as good. i certainly got that impression so i don't think i'll be buying it. limbo was obscure and vague whereas i found inside to be just perplexing"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-08,i found it to be a great spiritual sequel. totally did not see that ending coming.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-14,its great but you know six is the vilest charater of little noghtmares 1  2
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-14,she evil

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-13,you plan on painting it?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-14,"so many gamer relics in the background too, major props."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-14,i have not played the second one yet but i really hope that wasn't a spoiler

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,"i've seen a lot of fanart about it and i'm obsessed with it, but little nightmares never seemed that interesting to me... is ln2 any different than the first one?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,as someone thats been wanting to play it this picture gives more questions then answers
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,is it longer than 1st?

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,"if you didn't like the first one, i unfortunately can't say that the second is much different in terms of gameplay. it is a lot scarier and i think it's more immersive. i had to watch a couple of theorycrafting videos to get myself interested i watched superhorrorbro and now i can't stop thinking about the universe, especially after the second game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-04,lol treat yourself to those answers in the game! it's so good!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,"definitely! first one was like 2 hours, this new one took me about 5 hours"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,complete edition has the dlc and the normal one does not
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-15,lol i hate that i can see it
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,i dont want spoilers but does it build on that crazy ending from 1 or different character?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,i would say that having played the first game will make certain moments in the second game more resonant. edit to add but it doesnt pick up where the first game left off.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,it kinda explains a lot of stuff but doesn't pick up right after the ending of the first one or anything like that
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,it builds on it in some ways but as the other replies say it doesnt pick up where it left off and you play as a different character
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,aww so no geisha powers
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-05,"nope, no geisha powers unfortunately, but there are plenty of other cool things in the game"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-14,that's cute
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-15,man i'm in my 20s and little nightmares 1 and 2 still make me shiver. at least your kid was trying lol hopefully they weren't scarred for life
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-14,"uh ho. quick buy the kid a few bags of haribo to get over his emotional scaring before child protective services comes. i'm sure you know what to do, but maybe play a little with him beside you and make fun of it, emphasise it's just tiny dots on a screen and those dots could just as easily be a picture of peppa pig, so it isn't scary. even if it was shit ya pants terrifying then that's okay, no shame in being afraid. hello neighbour can be scary, but it's childish and silly with it and so we can tell it isn't real. you don't want it coming out as twisted drawings at school that calls you into the headteachers office lol."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-14,ok?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-15,"yeah if your going to let your kid okay scary games, it's best to play beside them and tell them it's not real. i saw nightmare on elm street when i was kid, i had an extremely ironic but reccuring nightmare at least once a week til i turned 11"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-14,he was bein so mean to his little bro yesterday about being scared of the trailer too lol
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-15,haha yah when i was 10 i wouldnt be in the same room as the case for the damn game

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2023-04-08,the system requirements list a bare minimum of nvidia gtx 460. it uses unreal engine 4 which can be pretty demanding so i am not surprised that you are having troubles. integrated intel graphics describes a whole lot of different things. the game has been run on an intel hd 4600httpsyoutu.beczazwxfci0c but with rather disappointing performance.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,"i'm some ways i totally agree with stephen king on this, but the problem is that just because the main characters and the reader shouldn't be given an explanation doesn't mean there shouldn't be one. as the writer you should have a concise idea of what your story is, and it should be internally logical and consistent. you don't need to reveal this to the reader or the characters, but you need to know it yourself while creating the story. otherwise you have no framework and you end up going off the deep end eventually, and even the readers can tell. that's how a simple story about supernatural clown who kills children in a small town ends with a giant turtle in an interdimensional tugowar."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,this is why i stopped liking silent hill once they tried to explain what was going on starting with 3. silent hill 2 stuck with me more than just about any other game i ever played.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,"you butchered the quote a bit. the actual text is  big movies demand big explanations, which are usually tiresome, and big backstories, which are usually cumbersome. if a studio is going to spend 80 or 100 million in hopes of making 300 or 400 million more, they feel a need to shove what it all means down the audiences throat. is there a serial killer? then his mommy didnt love him insert flashback. a monster from outer space? its planet exploded, of course and the poor misunderstood thing probably needs a juicy earth woman to make sexy with. but nightmares exist outside of logic, and theres little fun to be had in explanations theyre antithetical to the poetry of fear. sourcehttpwww.ew.comarticle20080707stephenkingwhyhollywoodcantdohorror2  from his et review of the strangers"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,i think the real news here is that steven king put an apostrophes on the end of nightmare to pluralize it.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,there were a number of teases for alan wake 2 in quantum break which was another fantastic game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-24,"not sure about sk story's, but the alan wake story did not explain the biggest questions. i don't want to spoil anything here, so i wont go into details. there are a few questions that don't get explained by the end of the game. the spin off game american nightmare does show the aftermath but still leaves those questions unanswered. it also creates more questions that go unanswered. in my opinion, this is what makes this games story so good. it gives the viewerplayer the opportunity to create there own explanation."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,"i played silent hill 2 about 45 years ago. i'm still trying to figure out what the was going on. lol it the only silent hill i have played, but i did watch the movie. which only made me more confused."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,"i liked the ending of the show, but that's just my opinion"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-24,"yeah, i could tell pretty early on that the show had no internal logic or consistency, and that this was probably intentional from the beginning. but when people see something mysterious they want to unravel the mystery. trouble is, sometimes there is no mystery, only incoherent nonsense which is unexplained only because it's explainable. a good mystery of the sort king is talking about is one which can make sense, but is never explained."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-23,"it's not as long as the original game, but it does continue the franchisestory, and mr scratch is a good villain. plus it keeps the same gameplay. for 7 i think it's quite good."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-24,"yes and no. it keeps the story going but it not a direct sequel, just a spinoff. it better then the dlc, but because it an arcade style game, you will only get to run around a small town. collecting things, fighting bad guys and searching for story pieces."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-24,"keep in mind that silent hill 3 came out 4 years after the first game. so until then, we just had two stories of different people who ended up in this weird town. i wish they had kept going that way, with a series of games in which the only thing they had in common was this fucked up, unexplained place. like the op quote, the series lost me when they went back and tried to explain things."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-24,well damn. i'm gonna have to replay the game now. this explanation forces me to look at the game in a different light.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2016-07-24,"i think they wanted to make it intentionally ambiguous, which is partially frustrating given how many times they used mystery as a hook for the show that also had payoff for those mysteries. for me, i'm glad they didn't go through the battlestar galactoca route where it's very clear none of the writers had any clue how to end the show."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-07,"lots of spoilers below !they don't know they are in a loop. only mono probably knows it's a loop when he becomes the hat man because he tries to save his younger self from six throughout the game. !not sure where mono comes from. pretty sure the game never explains that, just gives you something to wonder about. just like they don't explain why six is at the beginning on the game !static six is i'm pretty sure kinda like the ghost version of six, because when she and other kids get sucked into the televisions they have static versions of themselves in the world as seen from the collectible ghoststatic kids !it's a prequel because at the secret ending scene you see six's stomach rumble if you played the first game you'll know why that matters and her static self look to a poster on the floor of the location from the first game. !she betrays mono because she thinks mono is basically taking her away from her safe space, at the start of the game you find her with her music box and you take her away leaving the music box behind. mono also hides under the bed and not attempt to save six when hat man captures her. then mono at the end smashes her music box to pieces. throughout the game you also see six becoming less and less innocent too, contorting the fingers of one of the mannequin hands for example."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-07,"for that i think it's down to user interpretation. what i got out of it is that the big tower you see throughout the game and at the end is behind it all. some kind of force that twists worlds to their liking and needs a conduit to functionsurvive, in this case the hat man and it basically hypnotizes people with the tvs"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,"biggest question is mono and six related in the first game she ate everything in her path, y couldnt she do it in the prequel"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,"the game never suggested that they are related, so i don't think so. only at the end of ln2 is six at the full sinister stage. ln2 basically has her changing personality from innocent to twisted throughout the game as i explained in my first comment. perhaps she also lost a lot of herself when she was captured and sucked through the tv, which is where the hungry mode starts because she manages to escape."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,"no idea. probably just an artistic decision to add mystery, works for me."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,now for my biggest question ever why dont mono escape from the empty room where hes walking towards during the tv entrance
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,you mean when mono is hat man? he can't because he's locked in. only when younger mono opens it is when hat man can escape you also have to remember that six is trying to stop mono from reaching the door when mono goes through the television. mono is fixated on opening the door to let hat man out but six at this point cares for mono and thinks she is saving him when in fact she is saving herself from hat man because all hat man wants is six because he thinks that will break the cycle and save his younger self.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,so if six is stopping mono from releasing the hat man doesnt she know about that relationship between mono and hat man
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,don't think so. she is just believing she is saving mono
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,and y the hell does mono start at the beginning of the game in a forest next to a tv does the maw ever get referenced in ln2
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-06-08,no idea why it starts like that. the maw is only referenced in the secret ending scene i believe.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-28,"i dont normally like stealth games, but a few years back a friend of mine gifted me the original thief gold on steam. i played three levels and specifically recall the third level was absolutely terrible being a nightmarish labyrinth like maze. i quit for a year and a half after that but randomly returned when they reminded me of it and i got completely hooked. the controls are a little cumbersome and there are abusable things with physics, but the sword level legitimately is when the game hits its stride and you get to play for a long time in the middle of the games prime. it is a very atmospheric game and you have lots of different ways to approach a problem, ended up finishing the whole game in about 20 hours and was really surprised with the whole thing. various light and sound puzzles will trick you and force you to think hard. the game is filled to the brim with little things that dont change gameplay but you can do for fun, like drawing on the map given to you on each mission, as though you were literally drawing and making your own personal notes. it may be a bit old but i can only imagine how much time i wouldve spent screwing around in this game at its inception."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-28,"they're closely intertwined, so a lot of them can be both. but generally, strategy is larger scale and tactics are smaller scale decisions. starcraft, command  conquer, supreme commander etc. are more strategy games because they are about commanding large armies and building bases. losses are often calculated into attacks and replenishing them is a big part of the genre production. xcom, fire emblem, final fantasy tactics etc. are more about controlling smaller, often singular, units and trying to mitigate losses as much as possible, as they often die permanently and can't be 'remade' as they are 'unique'. they aren't super black and white genre's though, as far as i am aware. like starcraft ii pro's often engage in very small scale attacks early in the game which is basically more tactical than typical strategy. there's some crossover for sure, if nothing else."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,"ditto. i love the genre, i love the company. i just could not get into it. i guess we enjoyed different things about new vegas than what the outer worlds fans enjoyed about new vegas. i'm happy for them. but i probably have to stick with the games inspired by fallout 1 and 2. thankfully there's a ton of those lol"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,you have so much freedom and options.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,thank you. i abhor turnbased tactics but... let's see...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,"it's turn based, but very engaging at the same time. it can still feel hectic and pressuring, but rewards thought and tactics. and again, i cannot stress enough how much you can make your own story, and then replay it for a totally different turn of events and experience."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-09-29,"haha thanks but i'm already familiar with the makeyourownstory magic. it's why i'm currently finishing up dragon age series despite loathing isometric cameras. dipped my toes in origins a few months back, just tying up loose ends in inquisition looking forward to veilguard."

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-08-11,"if you dont mind going retro, i highly recommend another world. pretty sure they released a 20th anniversary edition on modern platforms a few years ago."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-08-11,"if op wants to go a little less retro, theres phantasmagoria, made back during the full motion video cdrom days. available on steam, though i have no idea how well it runs"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-10-29,"i love the little nightmares games, but don't know how they'd adapt a game with zero dialogue into a tv show. will they only be adopting the first game, or the other two too? what about the dlc with the little boy in secrets of the maw?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2022-07-19,"as someone who hasn't played the game, it reminds me more of 1 world trade center the original, aka north tower. i don't know if there are some alternate viewpoints in game where it looks different."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-17,this is incredible! and horribly tragic if you know what six does in the end... evil little monster.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-17,the little girl has so strong coraline vibes
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-18,"that means your friend is gonna stab you in the back someday, or vice versa."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-17,"yup, i know what she does, and its weird looking at other artist that draw her like a little cute girl, but it's not"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-17,"yeah, seeing this and knowing the ending...feels bad man p"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-04-17,"i've always felt that with six, such a great character and i love the new addition to the games"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,"its amazing, but it is very short. if yiu are looking for something more long for your buck, you should see something else but it is really good"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,"howlongtobeat has the completion time at an average of 8.5 hours. so assuming you play it once, is it worth 3.50hour of entertainment to you?"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,i really enjoyed it. the demo lingered in my head a few weeks and then i finally bought it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,yes.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,wait for it to come to a streaming service
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,"i really enjoyed it, but i'm not sure it's worth 30. best to wait for a sale or get it on stadia free with pro subscription right now."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,i bought it for 24 and i loved it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,but is it really worth it for that price tag or wait for sale ?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,it's on stadia pro since launch.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,"i would recommand sale. its good, and i bought on launch cuz i loved the first one. but its a wait for sale game 4sure"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,i meant a streaming service worth a damn.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-07-02,it's on stadia pro with a trial subscription since launch.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"found this game at a blockbuster, with just the cd and this art as the cover. 10. no other information. snapped it up because of the art alone. x200b best purchase i ever made."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,it's iconic.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,deleted
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,ps3 had it bundled with shadow of the colossus. the disc has a theme of the ico cover from what i remember.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,heal is still one of my favorite songs from a games ost
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,unless you live in north america....... maybe they hired the konami usa guy who thought the castlevania sotn cover needed a castle on it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,dechirico effect.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,one of my all time favorites. such a beautiful game.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,ps2 have beautiful memories i'm sure many agree
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,major childhood flashbacks with this post i remember playing this and then getting my hands on the original shadow of the colossus with the paper box and art cards i really can't remember the studio name but man they cranked out some amazing titles for the ps2 fuck i'm old
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,absolutely agree!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,one of the best. had played it ages ago but went back to platinum it before i dropped out of the premium ps plus plan because of the horrid price changes. it's so good and a real treat to play. would love a modernized remaster.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,looks like a painting from salvador dali
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,looks like art form 90's pc magazines
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,here's the same art from the remastered game menu with the theme song you were there httpsyoutu.beqnspffubnto
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,wow what a game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,cover and game
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,perfectly captures the experience.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"i still have this with the art cards. i also have the novelisation, which is rather good. i have this box art on a keyring too."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"...except the american version, which was one of the lamest, most derivative covers of all time."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"the only game that's ever made me bawl my eyes out, and the postcards that came with it were all framed and put up in my games room"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-26,"i have to admit i loved it. both colours, light, character disign and gameplay."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,i have the stupid usa one.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,especially when compared to the us cover art. fucking ick!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,looks like the ps2 graphics of art.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,yep the classic design is much better than nowadays modern games

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,seems to be heavily influenced by giorgio de chirico.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,inspired by isn't this how ai functions when creating a derivative artwork?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,awesome
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,every era is the mainprotoganistfaceoncover era for the us.httpsupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediaen22biconorthamericancover.jpg
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,never played shadow of the colossus on the ps3 but it really was amazing to play on the ps2 absolutely great games and i will have to get my hands on a ps3 just to see how well the port went i imagine it's even more stunning with the ps3's system
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-27,i have said game its both covers on one half n half
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"the coziest save room track i've ever heard. i honestly love all japanese save room tracks, from resident evil to persona 5!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,well it is castlevania. his only mistake was not putting any vanias on the cover. don't ask me how to draw a vania i'm not an artist
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,some of my favorite games on there
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"haha, i got that version of sotc too! it was amazing. studio name is actually 'team ico' but i think they disbanded..."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,team ico
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"from my understanding there wasn't any specific official team, but they were sort of referred to as team ico. the idea was that the studio formed teams for specific projects, and the team that was formed to create ico and later shadow of the colossus and the last guardian with the leadership of fumito ueda, was dubbed team ico after the first game they made. it wasn't like it was all the exact same people working on these 3 games and more getting hired in addition. it was somewhat flexible or freeform. the actual name of the studio from my understanding was japan studio or at least was in the later years, before sony disbanded it, which collaborated with and created many original games. from what i can remember, one example of staff moving around from project to project was that some of the people who worked on the last guardian also worked on puppeteer ps3 and gravity rush at least gr2, except the high rankingkey developers."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,it's inspired by the works of giorgio de chiricohttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikigiorgiodechirico.

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-28,amazing
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,you only read the title of my post i see
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,why does no one read further than the title
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"oh awesome. yeah, totally thought of de chirico instantaneously. very modern."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,haha yeah the us cover is ridiculous
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,they did bring shadow of the colossus to ps4. the last guardian is also on ps4.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,i search for cubism art from pc magazine but i found none to illustrate my post.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,fixed the link let me know if it worked
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,that's a bingo. in my defense i hate how the reddit app displays all that
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,youll be okay.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,i've always wondered what ueda thought of it.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,"no worries, the 90's were my childhood. i know the sort of pc magazine art you're referring to."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,works now
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,it definitely wasn't his idea the na version of ico had to hit market by a certain date and they didn't have enough time to finalize this cover the jpeu version or add in features found in that version like the alternate watermelon ending iirc
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2024-01-25,that's fascinating. i never knew that and always thought the na version went the angry kirby eyes route and made it stupid on purpose in an attempt to appeal to western sensibilities.
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,just looks like a screen shot
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,isnt it just a screenshot with a black and white filter? or did you draw this?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"its based on a screenshot i took, but its not actually a screenshot"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"i did draw this, and nobody ever believes that."
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,bollocks thats a screen shot thats been desaturated
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,oh cool. how did you draw it? do you have a drawing tablet?
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"ok you really think i would be posting this here for my own satisfaction? nope. i have like... 133,000 karma maybe? and thats plenty i actually post stuff on reddit for the satisfaction of others d"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"op did not draw it, theyve done this before"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,i drew it with autodesk sketchbook
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,im not bothered how much karma u have all im saying is thats a desaturated screen shot ive played the game i have a good memory ive seen that area in the game same place most of us have been
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"well, based off of a screenshot i meant"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,seriously i actually meant based off of a screenshot...
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,"sorry for the late reply yes, im sure you do remember this place, but it was actually a screenshot that i took while playing the game!"
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2021-03-07,you just admit i was right and fell back into a hole
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-18,i don't personally like the blur effect but otherwise it looks good

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-18,"gj dude, looks impressive"

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-19,well done!
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-19,that part is so scary!

Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-18,your life is a sham
Reddit,Puzzle,Little Nightmares,2018-04-18,having a very slight blur effect on everything minus six and janitor would be a better way to blur the image.
