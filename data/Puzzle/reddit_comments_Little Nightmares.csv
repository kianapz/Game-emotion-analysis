85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-20,"Only one disturbing scene? Heck, they were all disturbing. You could almost say they were filled with... *Little Nightmares*"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,They were just trying to return your wallet after you dropped it.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Yup, just one really disturbing scene, the rest of the game was nothing but flowers and sunshine."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"damn, I found myself holding my breath just watching this."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Reminds me of when [No Face goes full monster](http://i.imgur.com/BUddbGL.jpg) in Spirited Away.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-20,"The one scène with the boy and the rat caught in a trap is more disturbing. Fun game though, loved every minute of it. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I imagine this is what a cat feels like when all the toddlers of the family are brought together.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,So is this game *Little Big Planet* on the brown acid?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,And this little gif has made me purchase the game.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I absolutely _love_ this game. The style of it, the bits of story you gain from your surroundings, everything. I really hope they continue with a sequel next year ( I know the DLC just finished up, I just can't wait for more )."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Wtf
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This game reminds a lot to Spirited Away
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-20,I kinda want to know what happens if you don’t make it...
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"God, I love this game. It’s amazing."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,What is this?! 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,[deleted]
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,The video is a little more disturbing than the gif https://youtu.be/6Ir3oSiHORU. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-20,r/nonononoyes
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This looks astoundingly fun
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"The most disturbing scene? I doubt it. 
The worst for me was when the little girl got hunger pains and savaged one of the gnome helper creatures. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This reminds me of chihiro...
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"""American tourists visit a cultural site in Japan."""
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,It's like No face and Mr. Plinkett had a litter of malformed progeny that the clown from spawn masturbated over.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,The first one totally makes me think of Auntie Whispers from Over the Garden Wall
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,WHOA
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Avoiding the adults was most of the gameplay; when your character eats, however, was the single most disturbing scene."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Ah, yes. Bed time at the White House for Melania Trump."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,''one'' disturbing scene?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Just the one huh?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Was I the only one that thought of spirited away after seeing this? 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"*spoiler* Imo, when the little gnome brought you food and you instead ate the fucking gnome got me the worst. 

This scene is pretty disturbing too though. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Yeah, fuck this..."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,That was beautiful.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Has this already been released? 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Reminds me a bit of the doc ock carnage vent run from the 2000 spiderman game
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"What do you mean ""one"" disturbing scene? Isn't the whole game just a sequence of disturbing scenes back-to-back?"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,RUNNN!!!!   lill tax payer!  
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Out of al the scenes, this one is the one that disturbed you?  Not the one where you consume the poor thing that just helped you?"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,are those  monsters portraing something or are they just ugly ass monsters?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I'm getting some spirted away Flashbacks.

But in all seriousness what is this game even about? I've never seen anyone actually finish it. They all stop playing after 2-3 levels and that doesn't tell you anything"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"That game honestly looks terrifying to me.  Not the jump scares you get out of a lot of games, but the 'wake up in the middle of the night sweating after playing it' kinda terrifying."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,All i could hear was symbiote doc ock
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Im getting a Pan’s Labyrinth/Spirited Away vibe from this...
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Fuck. No.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Still not as disturbing as I found Haunting Ground.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Has a spirited away vibe to it. Amazing. Well done.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,No thanks 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Super hero landing!  
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Just one?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Reminds me of legion on fx
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I feel like this would be something Miyazaki would make if he got really depressed or something.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Okey, I need to re-consider do I really wan't to play this game.."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Never has a gif brought my anxiety level over 9000.

Fuck you. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Reminds me of that one scene from the Poughkeepsie Tapes. If anyone knows what Im talking about Im sorry. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,[Arrest my phone](http://imgur.com/CJ278x8)

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Spirited away?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I can think of a better one. The scene so disturbing they added a backstory to it to make it *even more fucked up*...
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This game and its DLC is on sale on PS4 for like 10 bucks right now
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I swear ive seen this exact chase sequence in another game before
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,DAE spirited away
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Seems like a slight nod to spirited away. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Basically a typical wedding in my country
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I love this game. There's something so magical and beautiful about following the adevntures of a child through a nightmarish hell, where they are for reasons unknown, able to traverse and hide expertly.

The best stories like these are the ones that reveal the innocent child, was never innocent to begin with. And shows exactly why, they too are in the nightmare."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,DONT STOP RUNNING THEYRE HUNGRY
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Well now I *gotta* see a gif of him getting caught and gobbled up!
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Basically what spirited away would have been if kohaku hadn't helped shihiro after he found her in the city. Or if the old boiler man hadn't helped her get her job. Or if the water spirit wasn't a nice dude. Or if no face was trying to eat her. I miss that movie. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,That is a seriously butthole-puckering scene. Jesus. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,holy shit

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Thanks! I hate it! 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,all this reminds me of is Spirited Away

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,It's just the dog hallway from RE1
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Holy shit this looks so quality.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Such an amazing game. It’s like a more twisted version of a Studio Ghibli film. It’s so beautiful too, I love her little yellow coat contrasting with the environment"

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Reminds me of being chased by Monster Ock 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,What the shit?!?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This looks like an episode of attack on titan
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This actually looks pretty damn good. I might pick it up on switch!
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Looks a lot like Inside. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Thst scene was soooooo Spirited Away

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I’m currently playing this game and I’m being stalked by “the janitor” in the library. This game really makes me nervous and anxious. Can’t wait to get further down. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"This game was fantastic. Played it late at night, sound blasted with the lights out. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, even though it was rather short."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Yikes
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,God that was terrifying 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,It didn't make sense to me why they changed the name from Hunger to Little Nightmares. The game seems to revolve around the little girls hunger
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21, That game is gorgeous

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Looks like you uploaded the wrong video, you uploaded one without any disturbing content"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"The game is very creepy,everything is disturbing"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,What fresh hell is this?!
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I could hear the audio to this scene building up in my head as I watched this, that's how memorable this part was for me.  It's really well done, the way it builds a sense of horror and tension"

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I loved this game.
The character design is pretty unique and the atmosphere is CRAZY. Too bad there are a few hours of gameplay."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,OP seems to be forgetting the way the DLC ended.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Omg what the fuck is this !!!?!
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Reminds me of the animated segments of Pink Floyds The Wall

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Never heard of this game and just looked it up and it's on steam. I guess I know what I'm doing with my day then. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,That whole game was disturbing as fuck. It was one of those ones where I'm not entirely sure if I enjoyed the adrenaline rush and near heart attack feeling 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,It's the stinky cheese man! Haha the artwork and the little guy immediately reminded me of that book
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This feels like the 4k live-action version of some Miyazaki scene.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"This game had such an amazing art style. As well as that, I thought the gameplay and storytelling were pretty good.

If you guys want to watch a play through, that isn't about jump scares and over the top screaming, I would recommend ""The Scary Game Squad"" play through.

4 friends who play scary games. They try and figure out the story and have hilarious banter in all of the games they play. 
(They sometimes don't play the game well, try not get pissed off)"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,That’s freaking intense

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,That's terrifying. I must see more of this game

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,How is this disturbing?  Tense? Most defiantly. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This game was a really well done experience and also there were so many similarities/references to Spirited Away.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This whole game is so dang good. Definitely worth playing through if you haven't.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Thought about getting this game for switch is it worth it?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Am I the only one seeing the ""Spirited Away"" reference?"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I would constantly be hitting pause and walking away 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,HELP!! I'm being chased by Americans.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Not so little nightmares

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I didn't find it scary.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,okay.... so not playing that game.  nope.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Just like any Tool music video

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I think I'm missing something. Why is this scene disturbing? It's just a chase scene. Is it something happening in the back rooms after the doors open?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This is some junji ito level horror.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Fat people *are* terrifying.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Holy shit
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"This game was hugely fun to watch on twitch. I found the cook/chef areas to be really entertaining and the art albeit very creepy, was really well done. But I think the really long arm guy was the most disturbing."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"thats ""disturbing"" Its a horror game right?"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Whole game gave me chills.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Studio Ghibli gone dark is what my first thought was.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I felt like a cow in the meat and dairy industry while playing this part.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This game was really fun.  The DLC is good too.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Magnificent game

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Sure it's creepy but tbh the gameplay looks incredibly boring

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Was this game made by the people who made Limbo and Inside?

This game looks amazing"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Well. That’s fucking disturbing. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I've never even heard of this and it made me tense and anxious!
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,First time at Golden Corral? 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I HATED the janitor. Once I were done with him the rest of the game felt so much less scary. The janitor is nightmare fuel, a hand that will always reach to you."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,My daughter and her friend love this game. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,I need this in VR
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Do those things have a story behind them? Either in the game or just Japanese mythology in general? 

It's too specifically weird to just be a one and done spook."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-22,That entire section of the game was nightmare inducing.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-05-03,I’m just now discovering more and more Little Nightmares stuff since I found out about the game- super late to this post but.. wow at the Spirited Away vibes. Really dark and disturbing but awesome. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Run Georgie! Run!

It's like I was having a little nightmare."

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Really well done game atheistically but wish the gameplay had more depth.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-20,"Did anyone else think the DLC was garbage? I loved the base game, but thought the DLC was majorly lacking."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Looks amazing but where's the game? He jumped on a table, then a bigger table but nothing else hindered him from just running. It looks cool but with no tension it's not scary."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Suck it blues...
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,That is doubtlessly one of the most pants-shitting moments I've ever seen in a game using a third person perspective. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Very Studio Ghibli, which really took me out of the game when I was playing it because the first 2 levels (roughly half the game) has no indication that it will go anime inspired in its second half. I think most people agree the first half is much more Tim Burton inspired, so what happened.

Friendly reminder that after the first 2 levels, the game just stops being scary in general. This whole level was mostly just an action scene. (Disclaimer: I don't mean it stops being creepy, I mean it trades the slow unease of the beginning with outright exaggerated panic. With the exception of the twist, and the final boss battle, the last 2 levels of the game really drop the ball on building up atmosphere. Fitting for the climax of the game, if it wasn't for the fact that Little Nightmares is really only 4 levels long. Anyone that has played the DLC can tell me if it's more consistent in tone?)"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Only one? Have you played this game? And all of its DLC? If you even seen the whole game or play the whole game and the DLC you wouldn't be saying that.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Looks a clip from the Harvey Weinstein / Courtney Love encounter.   
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,one disturbing scene???? you blind man!?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"That looks a bit too uncanny. Nowhere near [Limbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nrzWJthl_M), in my opinion."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Scenes from the new Harvey Weinstein docuseries.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Graphics look solid as does the screenplay. But this level looks super easy, tbh. You just run and jump a few times? The first level of Super Mario Bros looks harder plus being chased by nightmarish goombas. 

Is there something else going on that makes this harder?"

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Is the whole game about walking at the same speed being chased by things slower than you?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Is it just me or this it seem like this entire section lacked much gameplay 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"As someone who has never played this, what exactly is disturbing about this scene?"

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"**Fun Fact:**
The game was originally going to be called *Hunger*, but the developers realized it would be a bit hard to find the game on google since “Hunger game” brings up a lot of a completely different thing in the search results.

They then went with *Little Nightmares* because of how small the children are compared to the other monsters in this game."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Looked like noface from spirited away. Where noface runs after the little girl.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,So what are we? Some kind of Little Nightmares?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Or was the protagonist... the little nightmare all along?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This was my first thought exactly... I still think about that poor little Nome 😭

Excellent sidescroller. 

You will scream. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I love the suspense of chases in games where it all kinda goes in one direction, but then you gotta make a turn like that staircase in this gif and it feels like you're not getting any farther away but you have to go that way.

Except for in games where the chases break immersion when they're scripted based on your movements. In the DmC reboot most.of the limbo chases where the world collapses on you just freeze if you stop moving. They're scripted with your distance. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"If you haven't played this game, genuinely think of it as Spirited Away except replace the whimsy with hyperbolic grotesqueness. It's the absolutely easiest way to describe Little Nightmares."

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"It is, I definitely recommend it if you like creepy and cute. It plays much like limbo (with 3d) and the art is some of the best I've ever seen. As for spooks, it can get very tense but the checkpoints are quick and generally forgiving so the terrible deaths you suffer aren't drawn out."

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Judging by the ending that is a resounding YES.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Fuck.That. I saw spirited away in theaters when I was 5 or 6 and I bawled  my eyes out because No Face scared the fuck out of me and I left the theater. I've yet to actually watch this movie because of No Face. That thing gave me serious nightmares. This clip just made me feel so fucking uncomfortable.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Upon reading more I discovered it is released on PS4. I have a Nintendo switch and was stoked to see it in the latest Nintendo direct. I though it was a new game not an adaptation. Thank you though! 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Will be watching this later today! Thanks for the info
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Nope. They just got the inspiration for this one from Limbo and Inside. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,It's a crazy good game. The first one was called limbo. Followed by inside. 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Um...what?
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,i feel dirty now
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"To be fair, he was talking about other scenes from this particular game. "
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,This scene and the one where noface eats the frog horrified me as a child
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"Spoilers, obviously.

I believe the scene he’s talking about is where the little girl in the raincoat (the girl you control) eats one of the small, cute creatures that pop up all over the game. 

You can hug them if you go next to them, and throughout the game they’re pictured as cute and innocent inhabitants of the boat. One of them offers you some sausage meat, and instead of eating the sausage you chop down on the little dude instead. Afterwards, the little dudes act a lot more skittish around you."
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Even MORE disturbing stuff. The game is a trip man.
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Yuuuuup
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,It's up for interpretation 
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"ehh kind of. the developers specifically made the plot very intangible so that they could leave it up to the players to figure out what was going on. you need to piece together many aspects of the game to figure out the whole story, and besides the story isn't really why people play it, they play it cause it's nerve raking as hell getting chased by creepy monsters!"
85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,"I really enjoyed it, a lot of people complained because it was ""too short"" but actually, I feel it was just right. Sometimes games can drag on, probably like this comment! and I get bored or start something else I never finish it, but if I recall, it is 4 hours or so, minus the DLC. 

The whole game is designed beautifully, the creepy sound, the music, animation and watching Six, the protagonist evolve. 

Usually I don't care for horror games, at all, I find them tedious, predictable and uneventful. I'll sit there with one hand on my straight face and sigh because the predictable jump scare didn't do anything, I especially find screaming over the top little youtubers a bit embarrassing but when it came to this game, it really hammered on the suspense and actually left me satisfied while still running to the internet to find what other people thought of the end and all the wacky theories. 

It's a great game, as long as you're aware that it's short so you're not disappointed. 

The one grip I did have was how the DLC was set up to play, it was very awkward to actually start, but maybe they fixed that.

85x9xo,2018-03-20,2018-03-21,Yeah from what I have read the controller is you. You are the person in charge and controlling the boys. From the start you weren’t playing as the boy but as the blob controlling the boy.

I liked the game but I have zero motivation to play through it again, Inside on the other hand fascinated me beyond my wildest expectations, the world feels so more “fathomable” than Little Nightmares which didn’t feel like it went beyond the ship you inhabit."

15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Probably unpopular opinion but I liked the first game, the second was kinda weird.

Not in a story perspective, that was awesome but the controls felt super clunky and weird to handle.

At least we get to know more of the story"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I’ll probably play it anyway, I’m just a bit concerned about the co-op. I know it’s an optional thing but I don’t want the single player to feel compromised in any way - like while I play it (in single player) I don’t want to be constantly reminded that it’s co-op (in a similar manner to something like Dead Space 3) by having those elements come first (I.e. switches/doors that require 2 people - or the AI - to open, and co-op based puzzles etc). I kinda enjoyed the first two because they are immersive and solitary experiences.

Also the change in studio is a minor red flag. Supermassive are a fantastic studio in terms of cinematic experiences - as a matter of fact I have just watched my fiancé play The Quarry and it was a blast (I’ll be starting a playthrough soon), but I just don’t know how they’ll handle this kind of game - can’t be hard surely, but I’m a bit skeptical that it won’t feel the same. Also Little Nightmares felt complete with the second game.

These are just minor concerns of course, I’ll play it/watch reviews before committing to an opinion."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I love the first two and was excited, and I still am but Supermassive are the masters of the mediocre horror game. And if it's multiplayer that'll just ruin the atmosphere, which is the whole point of these games. There's no such thing as a scary multiplayer game"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,I don’t like this at all.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,I love Supermassive and I love Little Nightmares but I’m scratching my head at this combo.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Ooh, I hope they do it justice, the Little Nightmares games are amongst my favourites of all time.

I even bought the mobile-only Very Little Nightmares. The only phone game I've ever bought."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-27,I just wish the trailer showed spookier monsters because the monster baby didnt seem as scary to me personally
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"I feel like cutting it off at two was good enough. It was one of the few games I thought was okay to just leave it off where it was without adding anything to it.

 Sometimes, it's nice to have a weird ending that doesn't make sense but is explained and makes sense at the same time. Little nightmares feels like that kind of game that should leave some edge to it."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Hmm. I didn't know Tarsier let the rights to the IP go after the second game. Not sure I have much faith in this lol.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I love the first 2 Little Nightmares games, but I can't picture Supermassive being the best dev for it. Will be very happy if I'm proven wrong."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-29,"I feel like it would’ve been best to leave it at 2, maybe like a dlc or something but not a third one. Not upset or anything but I feel like it would’ve been the best to leave it how it was if they feel like six and mono story is done. Plus idk how I feel about a new studio taking the gears."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,oh no
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Great news, can't wait."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I LOVE SUPERMASSIVE THERE GAMES ARE DOPE

But idk if little nightmares fits their development style"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Ugh, at least it's not bloober team."

15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"these games are too scary for me to play, but i'll gladly watch!"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,No idea who supermassive games is but wooooooooooo little nightmares 3
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Hope it actually has gameplay and isn’t just mediocre quick time events and 90 “endings” which are just scenes either missing or added to the actual like three endings.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Make it co-op. Last one had co-op potential
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,But everything supermassive makes is shite.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,My fiancé is going to be stoked
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"by now they must be Big Nightmares, ngl"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Love this series, the best surprise of the Gamescon opening night."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,i found the first one too ploddingly slow.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,I am excited for this one.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,What happened to Tarsier?
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Finally ❤️😭❤️❤️🤞🤞
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,i already know the co-op will be crazy
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Oh, yes!"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-24,Looks cool
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-25,"Yay!First game was very interesting for me, I hope it's will be cool too."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-09-18,"I have an Idea. Since last they said about coop ruining the horror atmosphere. 

How about still allowing coop but both players get to see story cutscene story differently (throught different glass that gives different cutscene each or if it's online coop its 2 different cutscene) with the twist they are enemies. That way it's still horror of at some point one have to betray the other.

If people happen to stream with this idea, it's gonna look amazing. Who decide to betray. Who was playing the villain and does the victim knows?"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"They're focusing on Hades II right now, which I hope is a strong enough sequel to stand proud alongside the original.

After all, Hades II is basically the first time Supergiant's done a full-on sequel to one of their games."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Dammit I did the same thing
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,OHHHHH
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,I was wondering why they were making this while hades ll is still in the works lol
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Can't wait until SuperColossal make a game
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"That's what I'm also worried about. Tarsier provided dark games for sure, but very elegant and with perfect pacing. I hope Supermassive are up to the task."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Didn't they develop Little Nightmares 2 with Tarsier Studios?

They might not screw this one up, if they understood what makes Little Nightmares good.

From that trailer alone, it did seem like they nailed it, from gameplay to the tone and music.

*Edit: Well, Tarsier studios created Little Nightmares 1 and 2, while Supermassive made the Enhanced Edition of LN2, so this will be their first attempt at a making a Little Nightmares game from the ground up."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Supermassive was responsible for the Enhanced Edition of Little Nightmares 2, so they do have some experience with the franchise at least. I think it's in good hands, and it's good to see they're doing co-op since it was an idea they were considering at Tarsier."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Until dawn was pretty good,the Quarry excluding the lives system rocked and the dark pictures anthology qas a mixed bag imo"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Oh dang I thought it was the creator of Hades and Bastion.  That’s a bummer.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Woah there! I think you're getting ahead of yourself!
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"If you haven't played it yet, download the mobile game.  It's really good and the story is also connected to LN1."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Did you try the downloadable ones? With the Kid
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Have a look for Very Little Nightmares.  

It's a mobile game, viewed from an isometric perspective, and it is a prequel to the main games."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,It is.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,optional with ai
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-27,Honestly thats a very common perspective since I heard a lot of people didnt like the controls
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-09-12,Oh man I recall that flashlight hospital area was the worst in this regard.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Dead Space was completely playable solo and the co-op option didn't hamper it at all.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-24,Just don't get it. The normal people will enjoy it just fine
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Scary isn't really what Little Nightmares is going for though, at least I never felt scared, more so just unsettled. I might be being a little too optimistic but I mean little nightmares 2 also had two main characters so it could work"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"> There's no such thing as a scary multiplayer game

I feel that the existence of Phasmophobia disproves this."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-27,Ikr? if tarsier was still there i wouldnt mind tho
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"They didn't, they never had the rights. Their publisher Bandai Namco did but Tarsier got bought by Embracer Group."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-25,"They got the trailer to mostly match the aesthetics and theme, they have worked lightly on previous games. Let’s hope that the single player isn’t compromised"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,They're busy on Silent Hill 2. Also I think Supermassive have potential. On the one hand yeah their games are basically the gaming version of B movie horror films but that's what they're going for.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Cause it doesn’t continue from the last story from what it looks like?
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,"Dark picture anthology, the quarry, until dawn. All great games, but nothing like little nightmares"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"You watched the gameplay trailer, right?"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Co op has been confirmed.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Bro.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,no
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,No it didn't
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-25,Until Dawn?
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Bought by Embracer Group.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,One of them said in an interview that they like to always challenge themselves to do something new with each game and doing a sequel was something new for them.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,Yeah Supermassive are known for making what are basically the gaming version of B movie horror games. On the one hand that's what they aim for but that's not what Little Nightmares is.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,My only complaint is that LN2 is too short
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Yeah. How dare they be… optimistic…
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,F***
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"It kinda did tho, the balance of Dead Space 3 was tailored for co-op, you have to play on hardest difficulty on solo or you’re gonna breeze through with how much ammo and health they give you."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"That’s not what I meant, the game is playable in solo but it feels like it was made to be co-op. There are moments where you’ll see multiple switches for a door but you only need to pull one in single player, and the fact that your buddy is randomly in cutscenes but not the game itself, plus the incredibly long encounters make it feel like it was made for 2 people."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-25,"I mean, I’m not in a rush to get it, but if I do then my expectations will be slightly lower.

Obvs know nobody is forcing me to buy it and all - this is just a first impression. Could be a masterpiece for all I know."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,the point stands. no such thing as an unsettling multiplayer game. unless the thing unsettling you is battle passes and the like
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-25,"To be fair, the trailer looks spot on so I feel like presentation will be solid. And the gameplay of the previous games isn't exactly complex so it shouldn't be too hard to replicate and improve on. I'm definitely optimistic."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-22,i mean it's even possible than 2 is a prequel.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,[deleted]
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I was just being snarky because I didn’t enjoy like any of the games past Until Dawn, I’m sure it’ll be fine"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,So why aren't they making this then?
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Bastion sequel WHEN.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Never played Dark Pictures, but I liked Until Dawn a lot. It did have a b-movie vibe at times, but it fairly innovative with its themes and had a pretty cool (and scary) story."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-09-01,They were talking about the main character
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,There’s also single player
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,You mean you have to play on the hard difficulty for the game to be hard? SHOCKER!
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Cutscenes were a bit weird, but not a big issues, I had no problem with the encounters either playing solo. The whole co-op thing is over exaggerated."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,To be fair it can be played singleplayer too which might be how I first do it. We'll just have to wait and see how it turns out really
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,You think the name “little nightmares” only applies to six and mono from the first 2 games?
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Bandai Namco, their old publisher, owns the rights to Little Nightmares."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Until Dawn is generally seen as their best game. The Dark Pictures started off rough but got better.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"I think you misunderstood my point, even on the hardest difficulty the game is still very easy because the amount of health and ammo the game gives you is way more then one player needs because the game was balanced for 2 players not 1."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Goddamn. So it was basically snatched from the hands of the devs?
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-09-11,Agreed. Their best work in The Dark Pictures was House of Ashes which is considered the best one.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Exactly this, it’s like the single player was an afterthought and they forgot to tweak everything, reduce health/ammo drops/number of enemies plus the random doors/switches designed for two people, also the fact that your co-op partner is only present in cutscenes and isn’t even AI controlled. Completely cheapened the experience."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"It wasn't any easier than the other games, and the game can easily give less ammo when only one player is playing, so I really doubt your claim."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"It's hard to say, statements they made about not making a third game made it sound like they were fine with it but apparently they're making a similar game. Unfortunately it's common for the publishers to own the rights."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"It very much was easier and it didn’t. So doubt all you want bruh but it’s true, it was a common point of criticism along wit many other issues, look up any in depth or even basic reviews of DS3, chances are they’ll mention it, DS3 was very mismanaged and it’s considered the black sheep of the trilogy."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Sources please.
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Ugh, seriously bruh? Look up any DS3 retrospective on YouTube yourself, they’re plenty like “avalanche reviews”. Believe me or don’t, it’s up to you."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,"Ok, I won't believe you then."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-23,Lol ok
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-25,What a critical thinker!
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-24,"Considering I've played the game, why would I need to look up viewpoints of people that are clearly wrong?"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-28,"Yes, I am, I played the game, thought critically about my experience, and decided that the claim here was BS.

Blindly following others like you do is the exact opposite of a critical thinker."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-24,"Feel free to stay ignorant, but the DS3 has a multitude of issues due to its troubled development and EAs intervening, this is a fact, there are plenty sources you can look up that go more in-depth, you’re a big kid you can do that yourself."
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-11-11,BRO youe so damn dumb! like people KNOW how bad DS3 was made!! what more prooof that god damn reality! no one give an sit if your opinion is different! since no one will think poop is tasty! even tho you might think that!
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-08-24,">DS3 has a multitude of issues 

It really doesn't, saying the same thing over and over doesn't make it true.

>there are plenty sources

So many sources you can't even cite one, LOLOL"
15yf73o,2023-08-22,2023-11-16,"Come back when you can form proper sentences, then maybe your opinion on game development will hold any weight, because right now it is worth less than the poop your are so fascinated with right now."

1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"For those that ask about the game, ill copy my reply here:

Kinda 3rd person action rpg. where you have 4 types of minions with specified roles. (Brown minons = fighters, green = sneaky and poison, red = fire and range attack, blue is amphibious and support). 

You direct them to solve puzzles and use tactics to eliminate enemies. You can also fight and cast some spells yourself. There is light upgrading of weapons, minions, and home base. Slightly open world. 

Humorous tone. It's a 360/ps3 era game. Both are good, imo.

Edit: 1st game deals with the 7 deadly sins, too. (OPs pic is Melvin Underbelly, who's sin is pride... jk it's gluttony obviously)"

1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Looks like a One Piece character that has a unique stupid laugh.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,I'm sad they never made a 3rd game. Definitely can't make this type of game in today's society.

1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I loved Overlord. It was kind of like a puzzle game, wrapped up in an action-fantasy game skin. In any game with a morality system, I'm normally good the first time through but I decided to be evil in this game. Because who plays a game called ""Overlord"" to be good?

And this is off-topic but I wish games with character creators let us make characters like this."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Well in 2007 there was Bioshock, Mass Effect, Uncharted, Team Fortress 2, Portal or Silent Hill Origin

Budgets need to be higher so devs now need to monitize as much as possible while playing things safe.  There are good indies, but it's so hard to find any that aren't just retro throwbacks."

Halfling: Gluttony

Elf: Sloth

Paladin: Lust

Dwarf: Greed

Thief Girl: Envy

reminded me  Clive Barker's Jericho (2007)"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Look, folks, I have to tell you, a lot of people—so many people—you wouldn’t believe it, they come up to me, and they say, 'Sir, why was video game character design so much better in 2007? Why were games just *better* back then?' And I tell them, look, it’s a great question, it’s a *very* important question, because back then, character design? It was *fantastic.* The best. Nobody designed characters like we did in 2007.

You look at today, folks, and it’s a disaster. It’s a disgrace. It really is. They’re putting blue hair on everything, everybody looks the same, no creativity, no passion—just *boring.* But 2007? Oh my god. It was a golden age. You had your Master Chiefs, your Altairs, your Big Daddies—*fantastic* characters. Unbelievable. And I know character design, okay? Nobody knows character design better than me. If I were designing video game characters, I would have made them so good, so strong, so *iconic*, you wouldn’t even believe it.

And let me tell you something—people say, 'Oh, you’re exaggerating, you’re just talking,' but let me tell you—go back and *look* at 2007. The textures? The polygons? The shading? We were winning so much with normal maps back then, folks. And now? Now we have characters that look like they came from some kind of woke arts-and-crafts festival. It’s really sad. Really, really sad.

But I’ll tell you what—if I was in charge of video games, we’d be making characters like it’s 2007 every single day. The best models, the best animations, the best *rigging.* You wouldn’t believe the rigging, folks. The greatest rigging. So, we’re gonna bring it back. We’re gonna bring back 2007-style character design, and it’s gonna be *tremendous.* Believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."""

1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Not the first one, I think? Only the second one and that ill-fated team game."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"That game was garbage though, couldn't hold a candle to the first 2 games. After (at that time) 6 years, fans expected Overlord 3, not a borderline android game spin-off."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"The thing about the spinoff is that it wasn't made by Triumph, who are off with their main squeeze of the Age of Wonders series."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Absolutely not, dont pin that failure on the fans, that game was just ass, a game made for no one because overlord was too niche a series for it to grab new fans and the game wasnt even the same genre as the rest so the fans didnt want it either. Rightfully so."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Shocking to me that there haven’t been more sequels or follow-ups. The Overlord / Dungeon Keeper vibe is neglected.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,What's the game all about?
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Ima sap that doesn't finish most of my games, but both Overlord 1 and 2 I have beaten. Very fun, and the humor is top notch!"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,I've seen this game come across sales a few times. Sell me on the gameplay in a few words because the art and design seems fun.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,The mail in F1 games are cheaper and less risk adverse for Codes Masters to release than making these kinds of games. Which is a shame because the writer has said she would love to make more Overlord games. The issue is Code Masters owns the IP.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I did some technical work on the Raising Hell expansion, but I was mostly one of the technical/graphics programmers on Overlord 2"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Id go crazy if i hear those words at a Game Awards reveal. Absolutely bananas.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Probably? I never played pikmen, but have seen gameplay. It seems similar."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,The game is essentially evil pikmen so you’ll probably like it!
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Oh yeah, I've heard a podcast where one of the members whined about Larian being ""fatphobic"", lol that was one of the arguments to subtract points from it, etc.. social media is a factory of sadness"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"yeah... I may get hate for this but honestly, I thought San Andreas was more fun than 4 was."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Dang... People so fragile they taking this personal? 🤭
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"They made two more after 2. The problem is that they tried to make the third one into a multiplayer game where everyone has control over a specific minion type. It sucked. Then the fourth one was back to the original design but it was also a prequel, and prequel games just aren't it.


But yes, this series needs a reboot so damn badly. Seeing your minions wear area specific armor and actually level up made it so damn good. Definitely needed more places to conquer or destroy, in my opinion."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,I'd kill someone for a prequel
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I would kill myself for a... wait, but I want to play the game.  Lol"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"But like, it was everyone! Not just the empire, but the fairies too and the elves worshipped fat women the size of this halfling and the mermaids were bloated as ""pufferfish"" mermaids.

Even the pesents were super fat, honestly it was one of those ""barely disguised fetishs"" that isn't disguised at all."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"in the early 2000s, the obesity epidemic showed a sharp spike in overall BMI in the american public, and that was when media began actively covering it. it just sort of also slipped into entertainment media."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,It's not an exclusively game-related thing. The entire culture between 2007 - 2013 was obsessed with calling out our nation's obesity problems. It went out of fashion around 2014/2015. Watch a sitcom from that era like Parks and Rec.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Honestly i never noticed, i mostly played destroy all humans, godzilla unleashed (ps2) destroy all humans 2 some ps1 games (land before time, emperors new groove and gex 3) and the tony hawk games.

For the 360/ps3 i never actually played the uncharted series, i beat uncharted and thought it was annoying thatvthe enemies knew exactly where you were when you engaged in a shoot out.

For that era i played, darksiders 1 and 2, dishonored, hulk 2007, fable 2 and 3 the deadspace series (except 3) tony hawk american wasteland, obviously the mass effect trilogy, such good memories,  infamous 1 and 2 + festival of blood.

I did play left 4 dead at a friends house so my exposer to the obsession with fat enemies was limited"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Yeah, so weird fat people exist"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I wouldn’t call it a twist. This is all based on past knowledge, but:

But it’s very apparent in the first hour  or so that this is the premise. I believe the screenshot is the first boss battle (which is about as far as I got when I played the game). And as you get closer and closer to fighting this boss, you sort of realize you’re fighting a version of frodo post Mt. Doom, only he became a lazy, corrupt king or whatever after his original heroics. Funny thing is, when I was playing this game I had never watched or read anything lord of the rings. So, I spent the whole time being like “this is weird and familiar. Maybe it’s lord of the rings.” And when I finally watched the movies a few years later, the saw the connection. 

Cool game. I think I beat this boss and never returned to it. Bought the game about a year after it came out used and sold it pretty quick. Just didn’t click with me. "
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"The game is 18 years old and 100% worth a play-through. Don't play the second one though, it's just not different enough to be worth the time."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,You should. It is great fun. Not particulary hard and absolutely hilarious
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Sadly, you can no longer get it digitally, and I have no idea why."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"It’s not a twist, you are the evil overlord explicitly going out to kill the heroes that killed the last evil overlord. It’s not a secret that you’re doing that, you are well aware of what you’re doing."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,I don't see a balcony
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Yeah, it fooled me too at first, but a crown wouldn't fit on her fat head."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Found one
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,…shines? Bright like a diamond?
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I enjoyed it, it had the same humor and while the gameplay was different, it was still fun for me. Most people hated on it simply by not being a ""proper 3"".  

I think back then it was said that the studio did not have the funds for a full-on Overlord 3 and they made the spin-off hoping to achieve the funds for it. That being said, its been ages ago so might misremember, though the publisher keeps sticking to car games ever since. Pity."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Who owns the IP, Codemasters or Triumph?"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Well, there was a third that absolutely sucked and the OG devs, Codemasters, don't really exist anymore."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Side note: if you like Dungeon Keeper, War for the Overworld is a good modern successor. Lots of the same, but lots different, too."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Being the bad guy. It's like evil Pikmin gameplay-wise
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,You're a villain and you're doing evil stuff with your evil minions.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"The game has a pretty cool story that reveals itself as you play. But to get you started, you get resurrected by these Gremlin-type creatures called Minions and sent into the world to rebuild former glory and establish yourself as Overlord! A lot more to it once you start playing."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I'll give you a line from the game: 

""This tranquil wilderness... so rural and idyllic. HIDEOUS, is it not? Try not to inhale it, my Lord!"""
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"The first game is basicly a spoof of The Lord of The Rings, while the second is a spoof of fantasy tropes in general."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Aesthetics is very much Dugeon Keeper inspired, but instead of you making rooms for minions, you're the Dark Lord and lead minions with you on the mission and them do things more directly."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"You are an evil overlord destroying all that is good and taking over.   
You can have minions with bra-s as helmet."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"You are the Evil Overlord, and you have to raise an army of mischievous minions to take down the complacent Heroes that are resting on their laurels.."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Hey, thanks for helping make some of my favorite games! I go back to them every couple years, and the Raising Hell parts of the first game are some of the most fun."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I’ll have to check this game out then cause I quite like the pikmen games. 

And I would recommend the pikmen series. They’re childish casual games but they’re quite fun"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Nah, it's just tiresome to see the same comment about this ""issue"".

Plenty of games out there with huge tits. As soon as a few come out with less then enormous bust sizes, it's woke.

Can't we have both?"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,">personal

Who took what personal?

You're the one bitching on posts unrelated to the topic you brought up. Pretty sure you're the offended in this situation lmao"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,i honestly don't think it was a fetish but more a 'they thought fat people were funny'.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"You're right about the fairies but the fat women that were worshipped stems from ancient statues of women deities embodying fertility, I believe. The villagers in the first town of Nordberg were just average. But I guess they just thought it was funny."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Opinion here, but I think it was more related to 'evil' being very quiet for a long time rather than a fetish.

In 1, it was a pretty quick turnaround.  Maybe a year or so.  It's pretty clear that the world was just recovering from the last overlord. 

In 2, it took probably at most 2 decades for a new overlord to take over after the last one.  Which is a good chunk of time for entire groups/species to become complacent with a clear threat to their existence. Becoming fat and lazy due to not needing to actively defend themselves."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,[Here](https://youtu.be/fee9zb-YCTA?si=4qvgDXyoJ2uC19xx) is a very detailed and explicit analysis
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,I think uncharted was a PlayStation exclusive at the time
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"I would gladly go through both games again to experience my stupid goblins picking up and wearing battle loot and celebrating as you do evil crap 

Even if it’s just stupid pumpkin heads and bits of rubbish. Sometimes it’s unique boss loot they wear before they tragically die 5 minutes later as you swarm them over some bombs accidentally"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,second one is even better tho
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Second game is awesome what are you smoking?
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,In that case I'd rather suggest playing Overlord 2 over Overlord 1. Second one is just more polished and gets rid of the ridiculous levels of bloom that infested this style of games in the mid to late 2000s
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,[Overlord™ on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/11450/Overlord/) ?
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Just looked up British tourists falling off balcony. I was not aware of the sheer amount of deaths related to British people falling off balconies abroad. Wtf 🤣
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Can’t fit on there. He’s gone to ask for fish and chips loudly and slowly at the nearest restaurant owned by a disillusioned Spaniard.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Too fucking funny. That's from the British tourists falling off the balcony right?

1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,I think it might be EA.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"There has never been an Overlord 3. You're thinking of Fellowship of Evil, a spin-off garbage game with a 20$ budget."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"And the same narrator as DK2

""Welcome back, Underlord!"""
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Mixed with an RTS strategy game, you have a lot more strategy with overlord then pikmin."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Is it available on PC?
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Nice
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,But the gameplay is?
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"But if that was the case then they should have known that the joke was over used, it was done perfectly in overlord with the halflings, litterly having a city sized kichen to prepare all the food to feed Melvin."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Honestly i find that fertility thing is just an excuse especially since the elven women in the first overlord (which this was a direct sequel to) weren't severly obese.

What i liked about overlird vs overlord 2, was that each era felt different due to rnemy design and landscape.

The elven forest was cover in nightmare pox with undead looking wood monsters, the begining era had the fat little halflings sure which the climax of that arc was Melvins boss fight where the fat jokes reached its finale and showed off the sin of gluttony perfectly.

The dwarves were just angry beards with legs and rock giants were an angry pile of stones.

Meanwhile, overlord 2 had the character designs as different versions of fat."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Yeah i had both systems at one point but never at the same time until niw, switched to ps3 near the end of that era, my kast game i played was payday 2, found some randoms that both wanted to have fun and that we worked well together.

Id come home from school and we would login and do missions, both goofing around but still getting shit done.

Some fantastic memories, i mained the sweet tooth mask you could get for 2$ back then."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Ah man I remember spending hours farming the hobbit lands and Forrest to absolutely max out the brown goblins into blenders
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Seriously?

It is no longer available for purchase on Xbox last I checked, despite the store page still being viewable, so I’m confused why it’s still available on PC."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Not sure who you're quoting. This is in reference to the fact that you have to be an approved user and not challenge the status quo to post there.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Peppa Pigs dad, too! Richard Ridings is the man!"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Yeah, they're all on Steam. Usually pretty cheap."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Kinda 3rd person action rpg. where you have 4 types of minions with specified roles. (Brown minons = fighters, green = sneaky and poison, red = fire and range attack, blue is amphibious and support). You direct them to solve puzzles and use tactics to eliminate enemies. You can also fight and cast some spells yourself. There is light upgrading of weapons, minions, and home base. Slightly open world. Humorous tone. It's a 360/ps3 era game. Both are good, imo.

Edit: 1st game deals with the 7 deadly sins, too. (OPs pic is Melvin Underbelly, who's sin is pride... jk it's gluttony obviously)"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,The gameplay is kind of basic but competent. The Overlord himself is a powerhouse but you control the Minions to attack your enemies as well. You get 4 different types that all have strengths and weaknesses so there's strategy involved.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,Perfectly serviceable.
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,If people knew when to stop jokes. Saint's Row would have stopped way before it did.

It's not on the Windows/Xbox Store but that might also just be a certain disinterest and with consoles there might also be compatibility issues."
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"When did anybody reference that? You interjected politics in a place where it wasn’t being discussed by anyone else.

I don’t like conservatives either, but there’s plenty of places to have those discussions. This isn’t one of them. Some of us just want to escape from that crap sometimes, yknow?"
1izl2hb,2025-02-27,2025-02-27,"Nearly every major political subreddit bans people for opposing opinions. reddit is a propaganda machine. 



/r/conservative has to only allow approved users, because reddit is almost entirely liberal and they are brigaded constantly.



Just look at the votes on comments. In nearly every thread, conservative opinions are heavily downvoted, while a couple of people that are suspiciously liberal are upvoted to the top."

1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Only Until Dawn and Silent Hill games have my interest. I already have UD for PS4 though so I don't see a reason for me to buy it again.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,wtf is “silent hill f” that’s such a bad name
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Excited for horro in da hood lol🤣
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,You forgot the casting of Frank Stone.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,[removed]
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,At least some of these will still be crap.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I'm absolutely starving for Slitherhead.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I didn’t even know Silent Hill 2 was being remade and saw it recently and genuinely almost cried. I can’t wait for the game to make my asshole clench
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,There's also Zoochosis. Current release date is 09/23/24
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Can anyone recomend a list of good couch horror games to play through with roomates?

to give more context, we did resident VIII, and was great. we can change controller but the story was engaging and the fact there is hidden stuff around meant we can all kinda contribute and enjoy not playing. Good jump scares as well. 

We have done some of the Until dawn but they arent always that great tbf. Just checked the occultist and seems up that aley."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"woah, gonna be a great October"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I am so excited for Little Nightmares 3, dissapointing that it got delayed into next year but still excited."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Don't forget Tormented Souls II!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I only have an Xbox, bummer."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,wowwwwww
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"First I've even heard of The Occultist, but seems really cool. 

This might be damning with faint praise, but reminds me of Murdered: Soul Suspect. And that game has some deep flaws, but the atmosphere always impressed me."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I just cannot wait for little nightmares 3. Three games in and we just now are getting coop.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I'm praying SH:2 doesn't suck.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Forgot reanimal
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Most of these look underwhelming tbh. I expect more from indie horrors like CONSCRIPT.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'm a bit concerned about Little Nightmares 3 given the studio change, but REANIMAL looks amazing."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Tbh I think horror genre is having the time of its life. It seems like the only good games for PSVR are horror games. Too bad I am not a big fan of horror games. But that is on me! Too scary.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Are they rebooting until dawn??
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,nice
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I just want something like SOMA again man. That was really the only game that terrified me to my core, playing on both my fear of the deep ocean and heights. Plus the huge existential crisis it gave you was truly mind fucking."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Also Hollowbody and Post Trauma from the indie devs.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Can’t wait.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Very soon? It already started with FNAF and killer clowns from outer space 🤣
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Don't have a lot of faith in Silent Hill 2 Remake, nor ""Silent Hill f""."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"as someone who's played through LN, the DLC, and LNII and LOVED them, i very much doubt LNIII will be able to capture the same magic being that the developers have changed."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,WAIT LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3 IS COMONG OUT. LETS GOOOOO
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"This might be a bit far fetched, but: does anyone have good book recommendations that are similar to games these (or other) horror games? 

I’m reading a bit too much lighthearted stuff and I’m looking for some darker stuff."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Reanimal > Little Nightmares 3
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Chat should I play until dawn?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Don't forget post trauma. It looks cool too
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,RetroRealms Halloween & Ash vs Evil Dead on October 18th as well.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Still no sequel for Alien:Isolation
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Reanimal should be there.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Subliminal just has its trailer come out too
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,LN3 but no Reanimal and is wack
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,The filmmakers have to step it up since every day reality is such a nightmare.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"If you're a survival horror game fan looking for a great experience right now, please check out Signalis"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Hasn’t until dawn been around since 2014?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I love the dark pictures games I wish there was more sort of co op games like that
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,But why not all horror gaming fans around the globe? Sounds unfair to only include the ones from the US.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,So far out of that list I’m only interested in silent hill as until dawn imo hasn’t had that much of an upgrade and have no clue what the other games are
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME?!😲
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Instead of wasting money on the Until Dawn “remake”, may I suggest buying it on PS4 for way less or emulating it? Also we’re getting Nightmare House 2 as a standalone game and the original mod is coming to Steam."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Waiting for Zoochosis myself. Looks fun
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"didnt until dawn already make a second game with a new title because of a dispute developer had, whos doing the remake?"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,The Thing is also getting a remaster by Nightdive.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I’m a bit of a wuss and don’t normally play horror games but I recently competed Still Wakes the Deep as it had a local setting.

Voice acting was fantastic and I enjoyed it despite the discomfort it caused my heart."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I dont see Echoes of the Living and Tormented Souls II
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,October Has Returned
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Let’s goo
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Yeah, there is also released Beyond Hanwell game, on unreal engine 5, I played demo and damn it's fun"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Horror gaming fans have been getting treated very well within the last few years already lol
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,No preorders
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Holy shit little nightmares 3.

Hell yeah."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I CANT WAIT
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Treated very well, or *horribly tormented.*"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,We don't know when SHf will be released and if it will be good. But I have high hopes and a lot of copium.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I don't have much faith in remakes and remasters
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Joooooosh nooooo
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Don't forget Alien Rogue Incursion and Metro VR (even if they will be more like action and horrro)
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Apart from those two Silent Hill games by Konami, yeah."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I hope so.. Now let's see how many come.out as buggy mess.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,What's the Occultist? I haven't heard of that one yet.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Refreshing to not have to read ""eating well"".

I'm exited for Until Dawn remake on PC. I finally get to play it."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Silent hill 2 is the only one to care about
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Can’t forget about the original Resident Evil trilogy re-releasing on GOG.

https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle

Resident Evil out now.

Resident Evil 2 is tomorrow, August 27th.

Resident Evil 3 by end of 2024."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,There have been tons of horror games coming out in the past several years. It's not like there has been a drought of them.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Late to the party, but there’s a game based on A Quiet Place coming out in October too!"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I don't know if Little Nightmares is in the same horror group as Silent Hill.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Oh man, don't get the SH community started about SH2, half of them love it, and the other half are foaming at the mouth over ""how bad it'll be"""
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Is it Until Dawn 2 or a remaster orrr what??
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Unless I missed something, I didn't think silent hill F was anywhere near being released?"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,There is more than what you put on here lol
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Already played until dawn. But little nightmares 3 and reanimal are gonna be so fucking good
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Alien rogue incursion is what I'm looking forward too. Looks like a spiritual successor to isolation in vr
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Im extremely iffy on Little Nightmares 3 cause it's not the same guys as the first two. Far as I'm aware its the IP owner (the developers of the games didn't own the IP) handing it over to someone else cause the original devs said they were finished after the first two
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"There’s a quiet place game coming too, not really in the same league horror-wise as many of these but will probably have some tension at least."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"I am so jealous of the people that will be able to play Silent Hill F and 2 on release, the way it goes now i wont even have the time to get a sick week off and just play them."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Yummy yummy in my tummy
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Tormented Souls 2 for me, geniunely surprised by the first one"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I think little nightmares 3 is not a horror game anymore. After seeing the trailer I lost my hype for it. The other game that looked like a little nightmares game was looking a lot better
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Is until dawn will receive remake or remasterd?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Isn't there a proper Alien Isolation sequel coming too?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I’m a newbie when it comes to Silent Hill! The new one looks great but do you guys recommend I play the OG first? Eager to hear what the community thinks?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I cant wait for little nightmares. Been waiting for that one for yearsss
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Isn't there already a ""Until dawn""? Or is it a sequel or some sort?"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"I'm waiting for the Casting of Frank Stone, ngl"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Don't forget Reanimal 🙏
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I'm worried about silent hill 2.  I saw a couple things saying that it only rakes 20 to 25 hours to platinum the game.  If true then I am going to pass on this game.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,they are all getting pirated
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Adding the huge incoming wave of horrific indie games to this list and you can call it an avalanche
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Dont forget subliminal [https://youtu.be/kVfq6a2WyWI?si=ntNL\_RkXu9mPWhwD](https://youtu.be/kVfq6a2WyWI?si=ntNL_RkXu9mPWhwD)
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I'm terrified and excited all at the same time :)
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I'd be into trying little nightmares 3!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Cant wait for LN3
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"I'll play Little Nightmares 3, for sure. But I am hype as hell for ReAnimal"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,WHERES FRANK STONE?!!!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,more stable frame rate for until dawn ?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I'm not sure remakes and sequels count as being treated nice more like milked.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-28,Little nightmares is my favorite. I lit love it bro
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-28,"Little Nightmare III? I didn't know that a second one was released! Gotta go after it, the first one is awesome!"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-29,genuinely excited about ittt.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-29,Little Nightmares 3 ? No one tells me. I'll be happy to get more trauma.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-09-02,Has anyone played still wakes the deep. I thought it was a good horror game. Short but good
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-09-24,I'm so curious what silent hill f is going to be like I grew up on SH2 and 3 with the western titles in my teens. I'm so excited I hope they do the remake and f well
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Nothing like a few remake to really get the fans excited!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I would caution against being excited for Silent Hill 2 Remake

All signs point to it being mediocre at best. The company Konami bafflingly chose has a history of mediocrity. Anyone remember The Medium? Came out just a few years back and people have already forgotten about it cuz it was just mid. Plus that free Silent Hill thing they released leading up to this remake was apparently really bad."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"After A Short Message, im not sure about Silent Hill f..."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Wouldn't count Silent Hill 2 remake on there since it's made by hacks, but everything else looks lit."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Not only US fans, but fans from the rest of the world too."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26, Silent Hill f? What is that? First I've heard of it. Is this a legit SH game or another half-assed Konami fuckup?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I’d say The Casting of Frank Stone deserves to be listed here more than some of the others
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Until Dawn is getting the Skyrim treatment it shouldn't be on there like it's new
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Until Dawn came out ages ago? You can literally play it now lmao.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Silent Hill F is going to be hot garbage I feel. If it’s anything like that last game they released
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"us horror gaming fans, 80% going towards playstation lol. Im not gonna see most of them for years"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Paying 60-70$ for Supermassive's worst choice based game is certainly a choice
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Wtf is the third game, how did you put in the same list as the others"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Idk, I'd consider myself a horror gaming fan but am not looking forward to any of this except for maybe the Kojima game."

1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Everybody sleeping on Amnesia the bunker
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Don't lie to yourself OD is never coming out and silent hill 2 is going to tank. F is in purgatory like good and evil2
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,The only miss on here is OD - that trailer was horrendous 
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,What about the Callisto Protocol? Just went on gamepass and thinking about trying it out.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'm so tired of seeing Until Dawn.

It was great when it came out, but I'm done seeing it being released over and over again. At this point I'm more excited for the Silent Hill 2 remake.

Also, Little Nightmares III is being made by a different developer now. The original devs said they were done with that world, and they're working on Reanimal.

Oh, and We Harvest Shadows looks good too, so don't forget about that."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Silent Hill f isnt in the near future is it? Seems like its still far away as there hasnt been any news in a while and given the Silent Hill brand I am not sure if I am actually hyped about a new game.

OD is also far off no as Kojima is focusing on Death Stranding 2?

Until Dawn is just a remaster or did they add new content?

No idea what The Nightmare and Occultist are so cant say.

About Little Nightmares 3 the last video at Gamescom killed my hype about it. Seems really lifeless after the original developer moved on and Reanimal looks way better than whatever Little Nightmares 3 is supposed to be."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,No Reanimal???
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,God please for the love of christ just no more online co-op horror games.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"what's ""very soon""? Some of these don't even have steam pages yet. Other's have unspecified release dates in 2025. Nothing ""soon"" about this."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,The one in the top left looks AI Generated same for the one in the bottom left

Agreed.  It'll be a PS6/Xbox Whateverthefuck title."

1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I can only HOPE it’s going to be a P.T type game expanding on it of course (not the infinite loops but that type of scaryness)… I can onlyyyy hope
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,OD is coming after Death Stranding 2 for sure.

1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,No way its him? Never played a silent hill game before but I'm definitely getting that one
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,A new Silent Hill game? Cool!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"As someone who doesn’t know Higurashi, I really want to see more of it. Like, will it be a visual novel type thing? I’m so intrigued by that original trailer."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"I think it looks the right amount of unsettling and uncomfortable. That combined with the setting is enough to get me interested in the game. So kind of curious, who is Higurashi?"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"It's gonna take a while. The console team at Creative Assembly who developed Alien: Isolation has pretty much been axed due to the disastrous development of the cancelled Hyenas. Maybe someone other than CA will take up the mantles, who knows"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,What timeline would you propose the game explore?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Omg yes, it needs a sequel but I dont mind if they take alot of time for it. Its hard to top that game or even make it an equal experience"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Or at least an 4k remaster with all the DLC.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"It will be really hard to improve on that, to write a new story on the same level and separate unnecessary tedium from necessary. Not even saying to add new game features without shifting balance in either side"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Rogue incursion is looking to be somewhat similar
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,That trailer looked super good.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,HK has never had anything to do with silent hill 2 wtf
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I didn't know about horror in da hood but its looking fresh and its free
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Silent Hill 2 without Hideo Kojima. Silent Hill 2 without Dwayne Johnson. Silent Hill 2 without Kevin Hart. Probably gonna suck since these guys aren’t working on it.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Do we get Norman Reedus still?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,bloober team is making it so its gonna be at best mangled
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,With Bloober behind it it’s gonna be real bad. Maybe they’ll add a new ending where Maria convinces James to shoot himself because he’s mentally disturbed…
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I loved metal gear but I'm honestly glad Kojima isn't involved. Death Stranding has some of the worst writing I've ever experienced in any media. Honestly MG after 3 was pretty bad too, dude can't write dialogue to save his life. He has some interesting ideas but people don't talk like he writes them. It's terrible. Okay rant over lol."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,It looks like they've already missed the point of Silent Hill 2's story from the trailer music alone honestly.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Yeap. IMO LN3 reveal was a little underwhelming. Reanimal looks amazing.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,That game looks sick af. I am more hyped about this than Little Nightmares 3 tbh.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I personally think they both look great, but LN3 has me a bit more, probably the nostalgia talking"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,both have coop so i’m dragging my friend into both of them
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Still personally incredibly disappointed that the devs of LN3 are refusing to add local coop for some stupid reason. But I was very pleased to hear Reanimal is going to have local coop :D
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I wouldn't trust Konami with a pair of safety scissors
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,The previews seemed very positive
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Like paratrooper said the previews seem to be positive, but with most games these days I wanna see the reviews first before buying the game or considering it"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,The bits I've seen don't instill a lot of confidence
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I don't either with mgs delta but I gotta give credit what we've seen so far is actually very impressive
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"It has looked pretty uninteresting to me because it looks like its doing the bare minimum of a modern day remake. When you compare it to the RE remakes, there was so much new life put into it while still perfectly capturing what made the original so good. 

The silent Hill two remake in comparison looks stiff and stale, as if it was just phoned in and uninspired. I also think a lot of what made silent hill 2 such a classic is how they worked around the technical limitations at the time. 

I also have zero belief in team blooper. Having played a lot of their games they never went beyond mid quality at best."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'm sitting here thinking ""Fuck, I should finish the first one"""
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"That series gave me a trauma, just reading the name brings back the memories"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'd definitely recommend checking out Stalker Gamma while you wait! 

The stalker community remade the monolith engine that the original stalker games ran on and made their own game called Stalker Anomaly. Then this dude Grok released a mod pack with a full installer called Gamma. I never played the older stalker games but Gamma is without a doubt my favorite shooter of all time. Best of all, it's 100% free. The base game is free and the mod pack is free while receiving constant updates."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I know nothing about it. What excites you about it?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Basically the actual little nightmares 3 considering it's made by the same devs.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,march attractive quarrelsome wide cow depend coordinated whistle physical beneficial
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,after below zeros lack of horror aspect I don't think subnautica 2 would be any more of a horror than the original
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"> Subnautica 3: Iron Lung

Now this would be an interesting collab"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,It's happening!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Is it really called Silent Hill f? That's a weird title.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Yup literally played it for the first time on
Ps5 late last year and was very impressed"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Cheeky breeki
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Hahaha good ol' Bendy. Well I'd say little nightmares is another good game to start. It's really upsetting though but it doesn't have many jumpscares
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I’m the same way, but I loved Until Dawn. It’s more like a movie."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Supposedly the remake will have more possible deaths and some new scenes
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Don't forget Supermassive's next horror game Directive 8020. It's their next Dark Pictures game
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Maybe it has something to do with music since the ""f"" is written as a clef."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Yeah the name is eh but the idea is very good
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Supermassive be feeding us
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"As DBD fan, I can't freaking wait."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Maybe in 20 years on the PS9
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"You mean, there's a Remothered III?"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Thanks, I’ll check it out"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,And with games becoming more realistic they def have to step up their game
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,They completely remastered the game
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Apparently its a remake which doesn't make sense... usually people remake like 20 year old games but until dawn is still really new
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I liked The Medium
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I wouldn’t call Silent Hill The Short Message really bad. It just wasn’t what Silent Hill fans wanted. It was better received by those new to the franchise.

Though, you’re right about Bloober - weird company to helm a remake of a beloved horror game when their track record isn’t great."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,They have nothing to do with each other
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,🤣🤣🤣 got me there hahaha
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Us, as in 'we'.
I thought the same when I read the title, haha"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Silent Hill ƒ is an upcoming survival horror video game developed by NeoBards Entertainment and published by Konami as the ninth mainline game in the Silent Hill franchise. In a departure from the majority of previous entries in the series, the game takes place in 1960s rural Japan instead of the titular town."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Time to get a playstation :P
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"OP doesn’t include Casting of Frank Stone, which comes out in a week, but makes sure to include ‘Horror in da Hood’ lmao"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,HidH looks nice
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,One can only hope
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Wow.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,This sounds like AI lol
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"kinda crazy how Xbox killed their own naming conventions right out of the gate with 360. meanwhile Sony just adds 1, calls it a day and is infinitely easier to know what the latest model is."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I really think it'd be funny as hell if they just drop the Xbox 2 after all these years.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Xbox Series PlayStation
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Yeah, didn't he also say that he wants to push the graphics to indistinguishable from a movie? I feel like that game is definitely in the works for future hardware"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,At this point I would not be surprised to microsoft name it Xbox 2 just to fuck everybody.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,PS6 and Xbox Gamepass superultrafuckyou edition
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Lol, we never know what to expect with Xbox names 😂🙏"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"There is a little leaked gameplay online. Not sure how reflective it is of the intended release, but it seems to be a third person game with the goal of making you scream so you lose. Generally games like that are somewhat procedurally generated to keep things fresh on replay, but it's Kojimbo, so I assume there will be a decent amount of scripted story content too. I'm guessing it's mostly looking for stuff, light puzzles, and very light stealth mechanics."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"The alien isolation tram actually split a long time ago. It was closer to after Isolation being released.

The actual people who worked on Isolation were long gone before Hyenas was even revealed."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,The timeline of setting the game after the first one and clearing up the cliffhanger they left it on.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Where did I say that? I said that he’s not there. He worked on a silent hill game before
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"> Silent Hill 2 without Dwayne Johnson

\*muffled metallic voice*

""CAN YOU SMEEEELELELEL ... WHAT THE HEAD ... IS COOKIN"""
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Can you even call it Metal Gear Hill 2: Rumble in the Jungle without these guys? I heard Michael Bay isn't even being consulted for it anymore. 👎
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Maybe a different ending will help the game
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Something about LN just doesn't feel right. That Reanimal trailer has me ready though
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"LN2 was a bit of a let down, so I hope the third picks up."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,If anything both the gameplay and visuals from REANIMAL look more like the OG Little Nightmares than LN3 imo.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Reanimal is basically little nightmares 3 named differently because they don't develop the IP anymore. I don't really trust supermassive with making a truly creepy atmosphere and interesting unique experience since their 5 most recent games all were juse sizably worse versions of Until Dawn but i guess we'll see. Either way this is the best of both worlds. Tarsier said they weren't going to make another LN game regardless of being acquired, so now we get what tarsier are making AND LN3."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Regardless people are right in being cautious with Konami, they've mishandled a lot of remasters in the past decade, and their last big IP release for consoles and PC was Metal Gear Survive... 

Reputation matters a lot, and Konami will have to have some gaming Renaissance like Capcom had in the late 2010s till now in order for gamers to trust Konami again."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"SH fans will eat up anything though, they’re starved."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-29,You shouldn’t compare silent hill 2 remake to resident evil remakes. It should be compared to the original. Silent hill will never ever play like resident evil and never should.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Gamma is so good. The stalker community has been warning people not to expect stalker 2  to be like gamma, which for me is a little bit of a buzzkill.  

 The way that gamma refined the gameplay in stalker was a chefs kiss, and I'm worried stalker 2 will be too video gamey. That being said its still my most anticipated game. Day one baby"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,It's a joke. [Just look at the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38EZ15TvKI)
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"The original may not have been intended as a horror experience, but it was certainly filled with horrific little moments."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Yeah I finished that and the og which was less scary and only had like 2 true jumpscares tbh. Loved it so now im trying
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I remember.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Isnt the casting of frank stone their next game?
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Kind of looks like F as in Forte in music... meaning ""Loud"". Would be a strange turn to name it ""Silent Hill Loud"" though"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"As far as I can tell, that isn't happening, unfortunately. Not that I got around to finishing the second game yet lol"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"What a waste of resources. Wasn’t it kinda perfect? I mean how much can you improve on a walking dead, telltale-esque linear storytelling “game” that’s more of a TV series with QTE’s? Is Hayden Panettiere’s forehead extra shiny? Or did they actually turn it into a whole ass game?"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Nah The Short Message sucked. If it wasn't what the fans were looking for then it wasn't Silent Hill. It's like passing a Dahr Mann video as a Christopher Nolan movie.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Gosh, I can't believe that Silent Hill: A Short Message and Silent Hill f have nothing to do with each other. I guess I was just being silly. On an unrelated note, isn't it weird how Silent Hill Homecoming and Silent Hill Dounpour and Silent Hill Book of Memories are all completely unrelated except for being games shoved out to small studios with small budgets and fast turn around? Konami wouldn't do that AGAIN would they? What with Silent Hill Ascention AND Silent Hill A Short Message being as good and well reviewed as they are."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Also a story for Silent Hill ƒ should be written by Ryukishi07 who is well-known Japanese author of several horror visual novels. One of his the most  famous works Higurashi no Nako Koro ni takes place in rural Japan of 80s which is somewhat close setting. This is easily one of the most interesting Silent hill projects in years
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Yup, there's also Reanimal, Directive 8020, Post Trauma, Slitterhead, The Sinking City 2 and so many more...horror in da hood is just out of place here sorry op"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"From a marketing standpoint it makes sense because Xbox was always gonna be a number behind and that's not good from a a casual consumer point of view. Parents going out to buy their kids a new videogame... what do you want, the Playstation 3 or the Xbox 2? 

So I think 360 was pretty good choice on its own.. but then every other choice they made after was idiotic."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Yup, I have Xbox One, and I have no idea what the latest Xbox is called."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Nah. It'll be the Xbox Uno.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Xbox series x 2.0
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Introducing ""The Xbox Live""."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"If they call it Xbox two I’m going to not buy it, just like I did with Xbox one"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I mean I was just playing Hellblade 2…. shit looked fucking incredible. Maybe not necessarily a movie? But there was no difference between “cutscenes” and gameplay. The gameplay looked better than cutscenes in other games. It looks simply spectacular
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"He worked on PT not an actual released full game. I don’t know why people think Kojima is important to silent hill games because he sure as shit isn’t, if you said team silent then it’s a different discussion"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Oh well 🤷‍♂️
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,It definitely doesn’t need a 6th(?) ending tacked on by Bloober “The mentally traumatized are better off killing themselves” Team.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"IMO LN3 trailer has a similar Resident Evil 5 effect on me. Having a companion makes it less scary. Horrors are much frightening when fighting alone

Edit: Plus avoiding the gaze mechanich hiding behind an object is getting really old."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Low key LN1 was only good because of the aesthetics ripped from Ghibli lol
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"That's cause REANIMAL is made by the same people as LN1 and 2, who due to corporate stuff lost the rights to their own IP, and the company who owns them hired another studio to make LN3 to milk as much money as possible"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"You say that but for more than half of the time SH2 Remake has been announced they’ve done nothing but complain about it lmfao.

It wasn’t until the last set of trailers dropped that they seemed to turn around and say it’s starting to look good."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I feel called out.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-30,"Youre missing my point. I'm not saying the silent Hill remake should be exactly like resident evil. What I'm saying is that the Silent Hill remake lacks inspiration and new life injected into the source material. Without those two things, it makes the remake redundant"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I did and I was confused if people were actually excited for it or not😅 It looks ridiculous
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Hearing *something* massive close by while swimming in murky water made me shit my pants harder than any monster jumpscare or creepy room.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,This guys profile picture is the dark pictures logo (for anyone who doesn’t get it)
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,It’s kinda poetic tho
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I mean you're not wrong lol. They had to do something to make it not seem inferior because ""bigger number=better"", so they just made it confusing instead"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"First I thought wow that's very clever, then I thought, who cares if you skip a number, like Windows 9"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"They have a chance to remedy that this generation by going with ""Xbox 6"".

Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One gets us to three. Then cheat on a technicality and treat Series X and Series S as two separate consoles to bring us to five. It's not the most straightforward logic, but it's not particularly egregious either. They don't feel like direct revisions of each other like the mid-gen refreshes do to their base hardware.

It's the optimal chance to right their naming convention in my opinion.

Who am I kidding, Microsoft are going to call it the Xbox AẽXV0-2% before revealing that there will be PlayStation-exclusive cosmetics in the next Halo game or something..."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,They did kinda shit on that when they went with Xbox one.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"They took a page from the numbering strategy of basically every brand that came out later than their competitors. iOS/Android, iPhone/Galaxy, IE/Firefox/Chrome, Intel/AMD, NVIDIA/ATI, etc."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Series x or series s i think.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Xbox 720
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Ya know what? They might actually go for that….
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Game wasn't great IMO, but visually beautiful and the best game I've ever seen. Worth it for that reason alone. Without spoiling, there's a scene with a tornado that's just mind-blowingly cool."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I’m not sure what you mean. I loved that demo and it would have been a silenthill game so imho it would have been great to have him onboard
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,One thing I  think we can all agree on is that P.T was and still is legendary
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,One of the endings in the original game is >!James killing himself.!<
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'm fine with coop horror, even Reanimal is coop I belive. I think it's that the characters looked overdesigned. I feel like most characters in the past had 1 or 2 things special about them and the 3rd game looks like they have more than that going on especially with the weapons"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'm well aware. 

My point is their game didn't have to look like Little Nightmares.. maybe they went into another direction.

But since it does.. and they are the OG developers... there's no reason to feel nostalgic for the actual franchise in comparison to REANIMAL, like OP said, when the new entry does't even look and feel as much like the previous ones."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-30,"I disagree. Third person over the head camera doesn’t mean it lacks inspiration or copies tlou or resident evil.

If anything the gameplay snippets they’ve shown looks like a natural evolution of silent hill if the series lived long enough to make the jump to the ps4 generation"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Exactly! For many people, Subnautica constitutes a horror gaming experience."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Happy cakeday!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"They are the WORST at consistency. It used to be Windows 2000, XP, and Vista. Then they suddenly numbered it as 7...8...10?!"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I'm calling it, it's gonna be Xbox Squared. Or make the console a cube and call it Xbox Cubed. 

Alternatively, I don't think they'll actually make another console. I think they're going to lean way too hard into this cloud shit they're doing. And I'm saying this as a life long Xbox fan."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Or just do their own thing but at least make it intuitive. 

Use an A, B, C scale.. tie it to a decade.. whatever the hell doesn't involve a jump from One X to Series X lol"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-28,"Which is usually just shortened to series to include both of them, which I'm not sure if that is better or worse."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Yeah, I have no clue where they can go from here."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"I’m just a few hours in, but I’m really loving it. Especially compared to the first one. I mean it’s cool that they made such a game, but I just absolutely couldn’t get through the first one. The puzzles were awful. And the graphics made me nauseous.. 

But it’s like everything is improved. This is the hellblade they always wanted to make, the first one feels like a demo compared to this."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Would have* is the key words. We have no idea how a total game would have ended up. But yes the demo/experience was really good.

But HK was never a integral part of what made Silent Hill good horror games is the point."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,It single handedly revitalized Resident Evil which is hilarious.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,I know that. I’m clearly talking about a new ending akin to the Medium that would make James shooting himself senseless and tasteless.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Oh don't get me wrong, I agree with you"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-30,You're still missing the point. I didn't say anything about a camera. Read it again
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,I wonder if the next one will be Windows 13 or if it's time to jump to something completely different.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,They've already said they're working on the next generation Xbox.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,"Yeah, I agree, Microsoft Gaming... 😔🙏"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"Huh, I actually feel like the first one is a bit better. I like the combat a lot more. Feels more free-flowing and open, and the 1v2 or 1v3+ are epic feeling at times.

Glad you're enjoying it, though. I think the last few hours are the best, so it only gets better from here 👍"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Yeah he's not that important to the silent hill games by itself. I did see some rumors that he had input on em though. But yeah he's not an important factor in them.
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,"All the endings in the original game were varied to some degree, so I really don't see them making an ending that's effectively no different from a preexisting one. They've already said all original endings will be in the remake.

I've never played a Bloober game, but I'm willing to give this one a shot, and both Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka being heavily involved makes me feel better about it."
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-30,"Yeah I used the camera element just  as a slight explanation. I fail to see how it’s doing the bare minimum. If anything MGS delta is doing the bare minimum for a remake. 

As far as I’ve seen silent hill 2 remake checks the boxes for what a good remake should do. Improve boss fights, levels, character models, voice acting and combat. Everything is better"
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-27,Welcome to Windows Series X Baby!!!!!
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Bro he made that whole game by himself
1f1s2uz,2024-08-26,2024-08-26,Uh no he didn't
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Post your grades too, OP. POST YOUR GRADES I DARE YOU."

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I really want to try playing resident evil someday. Do you use an app to keep track of the games you’ve played?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Put some respect on Survival. So much nostalgia of that game. I have a history of getting into a series with the “most hated” game but loving them. Solid list though!

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Funny story, I emulated Code Veronica and I used saved states. I got to… (spoilers ahead for those that care) the tyrant boss fight in the helicopter or whatever and was trying multiple strategies to beat him since I didn’t have enough ammo. 

I saved outside the door to not get locked in and I mixed up the buttons and overwrote my only saved state while stuck in a corner with tyrant walloping me and having me in a constant stunned state until I died. I raged quit and never picked it up again lol."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Halo 2, a man of culture, I see. What difficulty?"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I need to play some of these but as a dad I have been trying to finish FF16 for 5 months.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I did Inscryption, Evil West, Mafia 1 remake, Mafia 2, Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, Forza Horizon 5, and Ori and the Blind Forest (playing a 2nd time)"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Was gonna comment that the best game on this list is Inscryption and I'm delighted to see you share the same sentiment. Incredible game!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Scorn was alright.

It didn't change up enough IMO.

I was kinda surprised how quickly I stopped being weirded out by it all."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,All I did was buy games and dream about playing them

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,How's Firewatch?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I think you might like this series called Biohazard.
Has another name in the west but it should be right up your alley"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I heard Scorn was visually great but overall a crappy 2hr game. How was it for you?

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Good for you!  I remember Socom releasing when I was in college. Spent many all nighters playing with my friends and still waking up for 8am classes.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Firewatch and Inscryption, two of my favourite games. Well done"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I played RE:CV shortly after it released on dreamcast and loved it...I am pleased to see that it held up well enough that someone college aged enjoyed a playthrough 24 years later.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,That’s awesome. Good work/life balance. Maybe add a little more sleep. Keep up the good work in both you gaming library and education
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,That is some good gaming :p. How was scorn ?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I wish I could forget Scorn so I can replay it again. That first time through was equal parts horrifying and mystified.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Gun survivor whattttt love to see people playing that still. Its like a 6 out of 10. But it's a very special kind of 6.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Inscryption is a work of art.  Anyone who hasn't played it...don't google a thing just jump in.  

Little Nightmares II is better than the first one, maybe give that a go ahead of the 3rd one coming out soon(?)"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Resident Evil Survivor is 5 plsssssssssss
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Firewatch, nice. I bet it helped you ease off your mind from the routine."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,have you played the Alan Wake series yet?  great games if you like horror (especially 2 since 1 is a bit more of an action game)

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,You play the remakes of the RE games? I was wondering how you felt about them compared ti the originals.

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Ooh Survivor was fun. I remember staying the night at a friends house once and he had a PS1 with it. He said he didn’t like the game because he couldn’t get past a part in the opening. I tried it out and figured out how to open the manhole cover with the crowbar. I figured I was on a roll so I just kept on playing when he went to bed.

He was surprised to see me still playing when he woke up the next morning. Even more so when he realized I just beat the game. I liked the first person twist on the RE formula. I’d not played many games up until that point so it was a unique experience for me."

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Resident Evil really is fantastic, original RE2 is still one of my favorite video games of all time. Glad to see you enjoyed it so much! I'd highly recommend checking out the original version of RE1 just to see where it all started. And if you proceed further with the series consider playing both versions of 4, I think I like the original more for replayability but they were both worth playing in their own right.

Leon is the GOAT."

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Is this on steam? Are the resident evils on steam? I have just the remakes
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Why would you ever play Resident Evil Survivor? It’s not good.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Why original re2/3 but not original re1?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I just got done playing Resident Evil 2 for the first time ever. I've never played a Resident Evil game before. Fucking phenomenal! I'm hooked. I want to play them all  now.

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Inscryption is definitely a 6/5. I'd also put fire watch as at minimum a 4/5. Survivor I also didn't care for at all. Now scorn was such a frustrating experience to me for some reason.

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Halo 2 🔥🔥🔥
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I tried to play scorn and got stuck in the beginning area lol I didn't wanna cheat and look it up. I'm still there lol
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Was gonna criticize you but saw a lot of classic stuff so good job,"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"RE4 when? Best one in the series, imo"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I see you studied well
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I have a feeling he might enjoy resident evil.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Should I play firewatch??
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-15,Nobody cares
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Love Arkane Studios but I really can't with Deathloop

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Is it weird that first I assumed you meant his Endgame Rank from the Resident Evil games, and not his actual grades? lol"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Not just that, but major too"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I beat the moon once. With no crystals. And an ability that gives me health back when I activate my shield. And a weapon that gave me a very high double jump ability.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,yea i sunk 20 hours into it the past month and it went by so quick. cant wait to recommend it to my girlfriends little brother when it releases on the ps5 haha got to get someone else addicted
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i love that you guys are all worried about my academics 🤗 im doing okay and i have a 3.74 gpa. kind of stressed about getting an internship though 😬
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,instantly became one of my favorite games absolutely amazing gem >!i was sad for leshy by the end!<
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"It was great, the second act was a slog, but the third was great again."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I was very intrigued by the first act, and then the rest of the game didn't really live up to it for me. I had fun with the gameplay, but there weren't really any satisfying answers to the questions posed early on in the game"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i thought the art direction was phenomenal (i think most people share this opinion) and the vibes were good but i felt kind of disinterested by the end. i don’t regret finishing it though and i am looking forward to their co op farm themed horror game theyre releasing
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,honestly i think i had trouble liking it coming off the high that was resident evil 2. I really liked the park area towards the end though and I liked the characters. cant wait to play the remakes of 2 and 3 this winter!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I am old enough to be OP's father.  That is a list I respect.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,ive heard good things. ill try it some day…although maybe i shouldnt you factorio players seem to be trapped
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i think hard…not totally sure though
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i was so disappointed by the ending and i wanted to be emotional but it just didnt do it for me. really good game though and i enjoyed it!!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,freedom comes with a price 😔😔😔 what game do i play next
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,maybe ill skip that whole career thing and retire now…no videogames sounds lame 😒
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i hope he scares me extra good in the remake
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i can’t seem to put it down will definitely 100% it
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,🫣🫣 i realize it does look that way but i think this was just a coincidence haha
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"ill definitely play it someday, just havent got around to it yet"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,3.74…hopefully i can get it up a bit with my finals this week 😈
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"yea, infinite backlog. Its great. I leave little notes for myself about what i thought and give them a star review. I just use it in a browser though i dont think they have an app. So far, Im really loving resident evil and cant wait to get to some more recent entries!"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"haha i liked the arcadey feel and didnt totally hate it, it just has a hard time competing with these other games. I was thoroughly disappointed when code veronica was happening on a DIFFERENT island i 100% thought thered be a crossover 😐"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,well i have to do something in my freetime haha
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"if you like dishonored for the gameplay, its okay and worth playing. i didnt love the story as it was told mainly through like documents and stuff and it was sort of hard to follow. i liked the characters though. i kind of ran the same loadout the whole game too so i didnt feel reason to explore and get more guns. worth a try i guess but honestly only if you liked dishonored alot. if you havent, just go play dishonored instead"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Not OP here, I played it but didn't beat it. Definitely had some fun with it for awhile but eventually got sick of the fact that the loop means you end up doing a lot of the same prep work again and again. Also I seem to recall the online aspect had some performance issues. I would recommend trying it for yourself if you can get it cheap or play it through Gamepass or something. OP mentioned playing Dishonored instead if you haven't played that, I'd agree that's probably a good call."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"yup, im a marketing major with a co major in fashion design (i want to be a designer) but worst case scenario i work as a marketer for a cool company. applied for a playstation internship this summer 👀"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,NOOO THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME IS CRAZY YOU MISSED OUT FR. that guy sucked though i had to go back to an old save to get enough ammo and heals to beat him. not an re game without a stupidly hard boss im somehow never prepared for
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"If it makes you feel better almost everyone gets stuck there their first time playing and has to restart. So you should try it again sometime. Maybe utilize more of the save state slots this time though to make sure you have multiple backups ready to go, that's the worst when you end up softlocking yourself like that. I've been there before, my condolences."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,heroic probably. i honestly dont remember but i dont think i woudve done anything lower than that. another commenter informed me legendary is pretty crazy
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"never tried final fantasy, but if i did, i fear it would take me a long time to work up to ff16 haha"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i started ori and although the music is fire i dont really enjoy it that much. im sure ill finish it but it might be a while. inscryption was so amazing and its definitely in my top games
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Im pushing my friend to play it because i need someone to talk to about it with haha. loved it
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I thought the atmosphere was amazing and I thought about it alot afterwards. Impactful experience. I dont think I was ever really weirded out because I went in kind of expecting that but it was quite the spectacle
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"To be fair, some of the games are quite short. I dont think ill be finishing any more in december unless I burn through the re2 remake, but im only starting that once im on winter break"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Its a unique game with great voice acting. Its pretty much a walking simulator so if you can get past that its a short and sweet experience. I think 3.5/5 is the perfect rating for it but some people love it more than I
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,hmmmmmm ill check it out for sure
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Visually it was great, took me longer than 2 hours...more like 4 or 5 i think. It has a couple really good puzzles imo but the gameplay itself is normally quite bad. It really really stuck with me afterwards and I couldnt stop thinking about like what i saw and the meaning of it. Its more of an experience if anything and its beautiful in a gross way"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Its great if you know what you're getting into. It was like walking through a 3-4hr dark surrealism art exhibit. If that sounds like something you'd dig, it'll be awesome but if not...best go for something else."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,honestly it just made me want to play dishonored
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,im sure it will be nostalgic to me…eventually
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i had fun until the very end. I missed the grenade launcher so i ended up having to fight the final boss with only a pistol. He was easy to fight, but with a pistol, it took a whole hour straight without dying to kill him"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,It's pretty fun with a Guncon if you ever got a chance to try it.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,thats awesome! cant say im pulling many all nighters but im definitely waking up for those 8ams 😔
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,inscryption is in my top games now and probably my favorite game ive played all year (re 2 being a close second)
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"man everyone wants to know about scorn haha. It was seriously a great experience, hesitant to recommend it to everyone though because its definitely not for everyone"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"exactly my thoughts on inscryption! 

honestly after playing the first, i dont even understand why there needed to be a second let alone a third. if i see it for cheap and i have lots of time to kill ill definitely try the second but theres many more games id like to play before that lol"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,i liked the arcade shooter feeling.i realize survivor came out long before ipads…but it felt like an ipad game lol. in a good way
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I wanna try it! I have never completed a story mode game. A break from fps games maybe hehe.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i do like horror, but i think these recently played makes it look like i like it more than i do lol. So heres the thing…i sort of hated alan wake 1. I played it maybe 4 years ago and at the start i was enthralled by the story but the point flashlight and shoot gameplay got so boring that i hated it by the end…maybe ill get around to 2 since i heard it was good but the first one left a bad taste in my mouth despite being a cult classic :("
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,noooo
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i just finished it a few hours ago and although i really liked the characters and the gameplay was pretty fun i wish the story was told in a more linear way (i like my cutscenes) i just wish it explained to me >!why colt got amnesia and then started to remember, why juliana seems to always remember, why it doesnt affect anyone else like this (i guess cause theyre related??) and i just wish more was explained and included about the island that was explicitly provided to me within the story!< if that makes sense. word vomit"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,youre right i had no idea - which one???
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"for the gameplay, no. Some of the puzzles were really good, but for the most part, it was a drag. HOWEVER the experience itself had me kind of in awe and it REALLY stuck with me afterwards. Ive grown really fond of it after finishing, but while playing it I just cant say I liked it very much. Idk its just a great experience in a not great game. its short too ~5 hours. I want to recommend it, but i am also hesitant to do so because peoples opinions on it vary so greatly"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Minimal gunplay, average puzzles, great eerie atmosphere, not very long.  I enjoyed it"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"scorn is quite hellish and horny in its own messy way so youre not far off. in regards to halo I played halo ce and reach maybe 4 years ago, i played halo 4 as a kid but didnt pay much attention to the story, and played halo 5 as a kid too but didnt touch the story at all. so im experiencing the story for the first time really, albeit quite slowly since i seem to i keep putting them down"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Cuz we all drop mages after they prove useless in raids
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i dont want to talk about my survivor experience. i got to the final boss with nothing but a pistol. I swear to god it actually took a whole hour to beat him. not like with deaths, a whole hour of fighting straight"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i loved them. took me a while to get into the remake of the first one but once i got far enough in i fell in love. loved the originals ive played and cant wait to try the 2 and 3 remakes this winter break
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"not yet, when i try a new series i always start from the beginning so i made sure to play the originals first (except i started with the remake of the first one). im going play the 2 and 3 remakes this winter"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i would but i dont think this subreddit allows me to comment images lol
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"just finished the story for most of them, although i am addicted enough to roboquest to 100% that. i hear halo 2 100% is tough"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,marketing haha i have a co major in fashion design and i had a digital marketing minor but dropped it cause of the course load. doing like 19 credit hours 💀
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"its not too bad and i definitely take more courses than most of my peers, just dont let the homework build up and youre okay normally. obviously there are rough weeks but generally i have a good amount of free time"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i knowwww its on my list for sure for sure especially since i liked dinos as a kid
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,thanks 😊 i try to play alot of different games but this past few months really seem to have had a horror theme…im not complaining though since they were all pretty enjoyable
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I 100% have re2 in my top games aswell. i think ill play the original orignal sometime but not anytime soon. probably whenever i can get my hands on a physical copy. taking a break from re for a bit because playing all these back to back is alot but i cant wait to try 4
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,why 😨😨😨 no
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,the remake of the first one is but i emulated all the others. i liked them enough to collect them physically when i get a chance but unfortunately theyre not on steam. im looking forward to playing the remakes myself!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i have to play them all!!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"not sure. picked up the 1 remake like a year ago, hardly played it. then i seriously tried to play it, ended up loving it by the end and decided to proceed based on release date since i was interested. ill play the original of 1 eventually, but i dont want to backtrack right now…"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,yea re 2 is pretty phenomenal. ive enjoyed all of them so far!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i cant wait to get into 4! Im going to play the remakes of 2 and 3 over this winter break but i hear 4 is a favorite! sorry if my halo 2 rating is too low 🫣 if it makes you feel any better i got halfway through halo 3 and i think that one will be a 5/5 for sure loving it so far (i did put it down for a bit though)
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"no combat at all. just walking, a bit of running, and some jumping. all story driven and a bit of “explore this area to find this thing”. short and worth playing because the characters are pretty well written imo but i have to admit i was a little let down by the conclusion of the game. good vibes though"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i studied for 2 today before finishing deathloop!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"It is a gem, i was just let down by how the mystery ended. but maybe i was supposed to be. The voice actors did great though and i liked their relationship throughout the game."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Why thank you :)
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Risk of rain is something Ill play eventually. Ive played what remains of Edith finch and it was pretty unique, I didnt love it but I liked it. Never heard of that last one Ill look it up"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,really put me through it thinking ark was vincent
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I loved scorn. Some good puzzles, bad combat. It made me think at the end and really stuck with me. Worthwhile experience in my opinion but not the best 'game'. It seems like you either love it or hate it. and my gpa is 3.74"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"It was incredible in my opinion. Some people think a certain portion of the game is a slog, and I agree, but some like it. Instantly became one of my top games ever. It managed to subvert so many of my expectations by always adjusting the gameplay. really really awesome game"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"story and some side content. typically I dont go out of my way to 100% games because I normally dont play them after finishing the story and only return to replay years later, at which point I just want to play the story again haha"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,maybe I will...cant be that hard...
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I don't work fulltime right now, so that helps alot. I get lots of time to relax on tuesday and thursday but my other days can be quite busy. I think most weeks, its not more than single digits unless I really have no classwork for whatever reason. I hate the lack of money this brings though...time to go home and work hella over break"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"in my own personal opinion, yes, I loved it. But others dont always say the same"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i liked re2 wayyyyyy more than 3. maybe ill have the opposite opinion on the remakes as you too. but probably not, i really loved re2"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,real ❤️
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Yes, thats exactly how I had the time to do it haha"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i know…sickening behavior
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i can get behind this opinion. specifically the part where you go on the ship (or maybe leave a ship i dont remember), i thought that was beautiful plus the music was good."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,What would you recommend I add before the year is over?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I agree, surpassed all my expectations"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I hope I can find time to play videogames in the future, even if only on weekends that sounds great. Im enjoying it now either way!"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I wont be dropping out haha. Yes I am now a fan myself of resident evil and cant wait to try some of the more recent entries!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i heard its rough…maybe ill try it out sometime
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,haha im sorryyyyy i didnt really like it that much i mean the art direction is incredible forsure but it was just kinda eh to me
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-15,He’s just good at time management
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,i too felt like i was wandering in a maze at the beginning lol i get that
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,well i’m playing (roughly) in release order so i have to tackle re zero first. and i plan on playing the remakes of 2 and 3 over winter break. id guess i might make it to re4 in like april depending on when i start re zero. i hear good things about re4 so im definitely excited
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Its a unique game with great voice acting. Its pretty much a walking simulator so if you can get past that its a short and sweet experience. imo definitely not a must play but some people do consider it one. if you have gamepass cant hurt to try
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-15,oh my bad let me take this down real quick
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i almost tapped out in the first hour but i ended up liking it. once you get a bit into the thick of it it plays just like dishonored so i didnt have a bad time. and i finished it pretty quick ~6.5 hours.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I loved it so much haha. figure you disagree?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Another commenter asked so i checked haha. I have a 3.74 gpa, my lowest grade right now is an 88% and some A minuses. hopefully i can squeeze them into A territory with these 6 finals I have this week 😨"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I’d love to see a Risk of Rain game that played like this.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,They also just added the endless mode update which is quite fun!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"If the person interviewing you is a gamer, use that to your advantage."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,You got this!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I love the evolution of thinking Leshy is the villain to find out he was just playing a part 
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I completely disagree. The second act was my favorite part of the game, and I was really sad that it ended so suddenly. It reminded me a lot of SnK vs Capcom Card Fight for the neo geo pocket."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Oh man, funny enough I actually felt the opposite, loved act 2 but got tired of act 3. Fantastic game, all around though. Really had fun with Kaycee's mod too.

Also shoutout to deathloop, while not a classic I had a ton of fun rolling through it. Dishonored is one of my top series so just getting more of that gameplay style was such a treat."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Second act is just too easy. I shouldn't be able to beat every fight on my first try by just auto creating a deck. Third act has the best mechanics but the aesthetic and atmosphere aren't nearly as good as the first.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I struggled with act 2 and just dropped the game after locking myself from progressing twice. Just felt frustrating more than challenging. I enjoyed act 1 a lot, and I loved Slay the Spire enough to 100% it, I played tcgs as a kid. But act 2 was just not fun for me. Any tips would be great, so maybe I can go back and enjoy act 3."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i agree second act was a slog, but the end of the second act was fire and really rejuvenated me for the third"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"If you're interested, I personally think Little Nightmares 2 is better in every way than the first"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I agree 100%. It was a fun game, I liked it, and the art direction is a 10/10. However, to me, it was too similar to ""Limbo"" and ""Inside."" While this isn't necessarily a problem, I felt there was a lack of surprise factor, as if I had played the game before."

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Fascinating, I liked the park the least and loved the city start of 3 because I was left with wanting to explore the city in 2, since you get confined to the station very quickly and only get a very quick taste of the outdoors, so the start of 3 (not to mention the introduction of nemesis) were amazing to me, really wish I could go back the 25 years it has been since I played those for the first time. I remember talking about secrets we found in-game for hours on end at school!"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,People call it cracktorio for a reason.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Heroic I'm guessing. There is no ""legendary, I think?"" with Halo 2 lol. "
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I liked the ending a lot. You know your character wanted to meet the girl on the radio but the game teaches a valuable lesson that you don't always get the fairytale ending you hoped for.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Nah bro, what did you want? For them to meet each other and fall in love and live happily ever after?

Anyways, Red Lantern also made me feel emotions if you're looking for another story driven game like that."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Ultrakill maybe?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I'm still playing video games. Just don't get the time to finish one before the next must play comes out lol.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Oh you sweet summer child.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"The gunplay is just so addicting, I did the same thing"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Hell yeah dude
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i turned off the multiplayer aspect because it seemed like something that would stress me out haha. i realize i probably did miss out on a big part of the game playing that way but i dont want people ruining my missions out of the blue that sounds scary
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Nice. What year are you?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"It caught me by surprise because I was sure I had enough ammo for him. Can’t tell you what I had at the time but I know it looked like it was enough? 

I am pretty sure I had enough firepower to get him to 90 percent of the way to a one box defeat but since it is damage gated I had to play out the entire fight. It was a war of attrition at that point that I was destined to lose lol. I had zero ammo and zero heals at that point and then it was me on the ground with two X’s on my eyes X__X"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,X____X
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"For sure, man. That’s awesome as halo 2 is my first Xbox experience so huge. What did you think of the campaign?"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,The good news is most of them are their own story so you can play out of order. Big resident evil fan and I am glad code Veronica made your list.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-31,"Ori is in my top 10, both games easily. I will admit that the 2nd one is more enjoyable but I still love the first one."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I'm in the same boat brother. No one to talk to about Inscryption or SIGNALIS cause no one I know has played them. I'm like that Pablo Escobar meme, just sitting by myself with my own thoughts."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Good luck with your studies! See you out here…
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Cool :p. Well it is on gamepass so I should check it out. I guess it is more of an ""experience"" than a fps?"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"It is a good game; just take your time with it, breathe it in."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Treat it like an interactive movie rather than a ""game"" and you'll have a great time."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"So if I'm being 💯 a lot of people on the r/AlanWake sub don't even like the first one. They all say the gameplay is too dated boring etc. but 2 is just about universally praised. It won a lot of GotY awards last year (along with BG3, that one earning more GotY awards let's be real) but those two games swept last year's awards.

Also idk if you know this but it's also tied into Control. Dunno if you played that but that's also an amazing game. I played it after AW2 and was amazed by how fluid the game is. You throw shit at enemies and hover and stuff. It's definitely a power fantasy. Plays like a Metroidvania

Anyhow, great games on your list. I really enjoyed Halo 2, Firewatch, and Resident Evil 2"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Alan Wake 2 is one of the most well designed games in terms of both set/setting and gameplay. The first one definitely has charm but starts to feel a little cheesy, whereas the sequel everything has weight to it from the manner of interpreting clues to feeling the recoil of your weapon as you fire in the dark. 5/5 game"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"It stuck with me too, so much so that I searched this thread for anyone talking about it. 

I dreaded the combat but the atmosphere is unlike anything I've ever experienced. They should have either leaned more into scarce, more horror-like encounters or way more of the fucked up, gorey world interaction. 

I don't know what kind of price it's at on different platforms, but I'd say like $30 or less for the experience I got out of it is well worth it to me."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,its a work of art. see it as a walking simulator. The art design is insane.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Damn, you keep saying “as a kid” to Halo 4 and 5…I assume you don’t mean like…17 years old, right?"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"If real life had a boss fight, it'd be playing that game, and there is no reward at the end. Just the relief of no longer suffering through it"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,[deleted]
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Awesome. For what it’s worth, I bought RE Remake on GameCube the day it was released, and still play it to this day! I’ve also owned RE2 on pretty much every platform known to man. Absolute classics.

Have you tried Tormented Souls? It’s a new-ish fixed camera survival horror game (and usually not too expensive). Haven’t checked it out yet, but it’s in my Steam library ready to go! Reviews are pretty decent so I’m keen to give it a go. Stay well my friend, happy Christmas!"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,3 is my favorite from the series. Reach also kicks ass. You'd probably like Dead Space as well
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Thanks for the response I’m gonna go for it tonight, see what it’s all about!"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Nice. Still better completion rate than me. I’ve probably only finished 5 or so games in the last year.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"The gameplay was a little weird and time consuming. But i found the evniroment and ""story"" to be perfectly ""alien"" in every way. It was quite the experience"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,So how you didn't do more games despite having so much free time?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"its so simple but its amazing, the 2nd one is pretty good too"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-14,You seem like you have enough energy that I bet you can keep it going. I know plenty of work peers who *do* have more responsibilities than me and somehow find time to play every night. Good luck!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Try Skyrim ad Borderlands too bro
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,I will try :)
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Just tell your teachers that you completed the old Resident Evil games. That's GOT to be worth some extra credit.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Good lord I completed half the amount of games and I’m skirting by with all C’s and trying to prevent a D.  

Some of us are just built different."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"HELL yeah! Those are good grades and you're keeping your motivation up! You're killing it, OP! 👑"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,What classes and what's your major?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I have like a 2 gpa man how're you managing gaming and college lol
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Juco?
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,And chat gpt's help lol
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"What year are you in? I believe the first 2 years are mostly chill. If you are in community college, it would be a lot easier"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I got through college with a 3.78, but I also didn't play anything but WAY too much Guild Wars 2."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-15,now post your sleep schedule
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i applied for a few, but one im particularly interested in is a summer internship at playstation so fingers crossed! maybe i can talk about the perseverance it took beating some of those BULLSHIT re bosses"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"The second act made me think, “oh wow! What is this game!?!? What could be next!” Act 3 was like, “oh, it’s kind of like act 1”. I’ll admit, I hate card games, and mostly played Inscription for for it’s weird, Meta, storytelling. Act 3 was an absolute slog for me."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i will consider playing 2 if i see it on a steep sale i guess. what are the chances epic games gives me the second one for free this holiday season⁉️
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i don't feel that way exactly, it was great but there was a couple frustrating sections with the partner's AI, and having a partner either you was cool but also drew back from the horror angle a little bit. still an excellent game, still on par if not better than the first. also the runaway kid dlc from 1 is worth it"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"not yet, but ill get around to it. playing all these back to back got me tired so im taking a break, then playing 2+3 remakes, and then illl maybe play outbreak. I picked up re operation raccoon city for the xbox 360 but haven’t played it yet"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,everyday i wish i was like 10 in the 90s so i could’ve experienced the resident evil games in that way - i yearn to sit criss cross applesauce in front of a crt tv
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,The factory must grow
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,ah youre definitely right. i knew i hadnt played on the hardest just couldnt remember what the difficulties were actually called. i tried doing LASO on reach a few years ago and never made it far
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I agree, that part didnt bother me as much, I think it really captured the feeling of an ending summer, but i was totally let down by the conclusion of the mystery"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,ill check out red lantern thanks for the recommendation. i think i was just let down by the conclusion of the mystery and less so the way their relationship ended
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"> Red Lantern

If it's anything like Firewatch I'll enjoy it. 80% off at the moment too. One more game for the backlog."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,seen it before and im sure ill like it. this is the push i needed
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,thats so good to hear! hopefully i dont become boring and rotten and i keep liking interesting things… none of the adults in my life play video games and im trying to break that family curse 😤
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,sophomore
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i liked the gravemind guy and thought he was interesting although i was kind of perplexed as to how he was teleporting us around all the time. the beginning i did not like but there were some great missions towards the end. love all of the religious turning on prophets and stuff pretty good. afterwards i played through half of halo 3 then took a break but so far halo 3 is by far my favorite in terms of story/missions
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i loved code veronica! and i was surprised to find that some people really didnt like it when i looked at others reviews of the game after i finished it. and Ive heard that final fantasy are their own stories generally but i think id like to start at the beginning anyways just to kind of get to know the whole series if that makes sense
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,exactly. its clunky at times and i almost put it down but im so glad i finished it cause it ended up really sticking with me afterwards
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,Thanks. I'll try it!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Yea i played control a bit! graphics impressed me alot and the throwing stuff was cool however i just idk the gameplay feels flat to me? not sure but i never finished it, not even necessarily because i didnt like it but honestly because of not wanting to get on the epic games launcher haha"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,oh i totally agree i really loved it despite some flaws and want to get my hands on a physical copy. im a fan of the alien movies so the h.r. geiger esque environment was awesome too
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"im 20, so i played halo 4 when i was like 12"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Haha, it's so bad it's good though. I may be a raccoon because I unironically love trash. XD"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,im not dming you my schedule thatd be weird haha😭
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"for some reason i was never able to finish dead space. i think i was near the end though when I put it down. i was terrified to start playing it and once i did, it wasnt too scary to wield a gun. Kind of hard to get back in so i might have to restart it since its been awhile"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I hope you like it!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"ive played skyrim many a times, and i played borderlands 1+2 when i was younger but never finished them"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,let me draft up that email right now!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Extra credit only if completed with S rank
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,I clocked around 5000 hours of Albion online during my Doctorate program. It can be done. Finished with a 3.5ish GPA.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"second level accounting class, content marketing class, sewing lab, a management class, isa class, and a geology class 🤮. im a marketing major with a co major in fashion design (hence the sewing lab)"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"regular, public 4 year university that charges too much for tuition"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,noooo I pretty much refuse to use that stuff given my interest in arts and stuff
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Im in a regular public 4 year university and im a sophomore. Taking more credit hours than most of my peers because i have a co major but its really not that bad. Plus, these games are all not too long"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"I doubt they'd give it for free, but it is on sale for $10 right now on GOG if you're interested :D"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,LASO is insane! I tried on CE (my fav) and couldn't progress past the opening level lol. 
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Ah man I beat LASO reach a few months ago and it changed the whole feel of the game. Honestly stopped feeling like halo and felt more akin to a puzzle game, figuring out the best paths to take. Fun experience overall imo lol"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"I liked that it turned out to be a more ""human"" story rather than some sci-fi/government conspiracy.

Before I played it, I wasn't really into ""walking sims"" but ended up absolutely loving it. I've replayed it a couple of times as it's like rewatching a favourite movie."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"Holy, yeah for $5 that's amazing. It's only about 5 hours of gameplay, but it's a beautiful 5 hours."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Enjoy it while you can!
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Loved code Veronica as well. I played it on my brother's Dreamcast, but I wasn't able to finish it. Disk 2 was damaged and unreadable. I ended up playing disk one over and over to a point where I could reach the end of Disk 1 (which, iirc is when they ride a speed boat?) in 3hrs, including cut scenes."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Sounds cool.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"#dang, am I unc?

I can recall booting up the OG Xbox to play Halo CE with my step-bro. Big ole’ honker of a controller too, though I know it’s truly not *that* old."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,"So I just dove straight in, no spoilers or preview other than the 1:30 trailer…. I played up to the second map boss the first time (can’t remember what the boss was) and was defeated. Then made it up to the third map boss which was the trapper… defeated again. 

Had to turn it off and get to bed but I’m finding myself strangely addicted to this little card game! The stoat and the stink bug are great. 

Funny thing, first tutorial battle I sacrificed the stoat, kind of by accident and he didn’t let me forget it until the second play through lol

Great game so far and the options keep expanding. It’s turning into a fun chess game that’s getting more complex the deeper I go."

1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i think the plane fight is the end of disk 1. did you ever get around to the second half? things sure get wacky
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,i want an og xbox so bad. slowly building a collection and cant wait to play around on it. doesnt make sense to buy it now because its not like i have space for various consoles
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-12,youre in for a treat! i got so hooked i pretty much finished it in my second sitting which was an admittedly very unhealthy amount of time
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Let me just slide my E rank out of view...
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Yes? Do they do pass/fail in Europe or something? Mine definitely had a standard A/B/C/D or fail GPA scale. 0-4.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Sort of I think? I need a certain number of credit hours outside of the business school to graduate and that includes a sciences class. Not super outlandish here but probably depends on your university. Im a sophmore and im already pretty much hitting all those requirements, so for junior and senior year my classes will be more focused with no random stragglers."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"First two years of university in US are going to be more general classes (Usually 2 main class relates to major and 3 more that are general like science, math, english), while the last two years are more specialized (majority of classes are related to major)."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Probably a science requirement. You have some amount of elective slots you need to fill from various categories of classes. I went to school for physics and ended up taking a linguistics class.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Most colleges in the US have Gen Ed (general education) hours requirements which boils down to needing a certain about of hours in math, science, history and English. Roughly need 2 of 3 of each subject to fulfill them. There are ways to get outta them with things like AP credits"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,yea its cool. my tuesdays and Thursdays are super relaxed and i just do homework and game. monday and wednesday i go nonstop from 8-6…so those days i dont get to play at all or do much of anything
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"i thought so, but 100% had to look up what juco was even though i had a good guess haha"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,Nope. But maybe I should. I hope there's a PC version.
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"Yeah no, the OG Xbox is **beeg**. Not like, laboriously or annoyingly so, but it certainly is a chonky console."
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"No GPAs in Europe either but my experience with Doctoral programs round the US is if you do technically have a GPA, not a single student I knew could tell you theirs. That they are totally intelligent and meaningless. I’m so interested. What was your program in?"
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,on pc youd have to emulate it. there is an xbox 360/ps3 version that released but thats as recent as it gets
1hbj0xt,2024-12-11,2024-12-11,"My program was a PharmD. And the only reason I know my GPA is because it is on my diploma, i got ""High Distinction"" which I believe is similar to Magna Cum Laude."

1hjf30e,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"It’s a beautiful game, but storywise and game mechanic-wise I found it to be very generic. A few great moments alongside a lot of pushing box puzzles and waiting for enemies to turn around stealth sections. And it didn’t really come together in a satisfying or shocking way like the best of the genre. But the artwork is fantastic. I gave it a 6/10."
1hjf30e,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"I almost disliked it because I played Inside already. Planet of Lana doesn't add much new ideas to the genre and the execution and atmosphere is wayyy better in Inside, still the goat of cinematic platformer."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"My plan to sort this mess out would be something along these lines: 
(Its been a while since I’ve played Civ 2 but I can remember some stuff…)

- Forget ending the war, try and get your front line such that you can consistently withstand attack, forcing a stalemate. Basically stop wasting production on tanks and planes that are going to get nuked anyway.
- Change to fundamentalism, I remember this was bad for research but you don’t need it now anyway, but the people will stop hating you and you'll have more coin.
- Get your core cities to rebuild and fix the land surrounding them (very costly in engineers, in know) and get farms and production moving! I’m guessing it take a lot of turns to build a tank in a low population city. 
- once all that’s in place, build an army of tanks, mountain troops, artillery and spys the like of which has never been seen and keep it off the frontlines, build rail roads as far as they'll go without losing engineers.
- once all is in place, get spys in every enemy city (enough to guarantee a nuke hit) all the way to their capital, hit em all at once and drop in the mountain boys, wait for the nuke response, hopefully using their whole stockpile, then move your conventional army in and mop up the mess.
- Repeat with the other guys.

Diplomacy's failed in this world, you’ve got to hit em hard and take over the world for the greater good. Then you can spend turn upon turn under the blanket of enforced religious peace fixing it with hundreds of engineers if you like!

Its for the greater good. "

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"First off: Awesome game man! I'm almost hesitant to give you advice on how to finish this one because it sounds like a truly epic struggle. Also as many have already commented, the parallels between your game and 1984 are really remarkable. You should save this game in honor of Orwell's foresight :)

Now how to finish this game:

The best way to conquer your enemies in Civ (that i've always found anyways) is to build a few super production cities and then mass up an insane army (the kind that takes 20mins just to MOVE).

So to begin with: Choose a few core cities that are usually safe from attack. Make the rest of your crappy outer cities build 1 engineer each and send them to beef up the land around your cores.
2. Once your cores are primed and ready for production (20 shields production per turn...minimum!!! Change the terrain to mountains and mine those suckers if you have to) - start pumping out units. You're going to want to focus on tanks and howitzers and mechanized infantry. Howitzers to pummel any defense your opponent has in his cities, Tanks to kill weaker units in the surrounding hills and mech infantry to defend them once captured.

3. This strategy revolves entirely on a few massive pushes - think D-Day Normandy kind of scale. Ideally, you shouldn't even launch the attack until you are confident that the army you have is enough to defeat every single enemy unit.

Good luck!

Oh, this seems to be everyone's plan, and thus a core problem you're trying to overcome.

Shit, I'm out if ideas. Whenever ""nuke the piss out of it"" fails as a strategy, I don't have a plan B."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"It seemed like just another day in this never-ending war. The last few historians left (who needs history now, really) agree that it has been going on for at least 1500 years, but their estimates vary. Why does it matter, anyway. The leaders of the remaining superpowers are locked in this pointless struggle, with no breakthrough. I have no idea how the Vikings keep being so consistent over such a long time, but the Communists have had the same family (and principles) in power ever since the war began and over here in America we've hooked up our president to a computer so he could rule forever. What a brilliant plan that was... Each nation is powerful just enough so neither can fall. Every time a city is captured, it is taken the next day. When roads are build in order to help dry up the swamps, they are immediately destroyed. The only way to rebuild our Earth is for someone to win, but that won't happen. At least, that's what I thought until now.

Our forces took another city by dawn. Nothing was special about it, apart from the fact that it was the first time it has been under American control since the war began. It's not that it was heavily guarded, only it was never deemed important enough for capture. As a part of our new military ""strategy"", we had to capture it for the slight chance that an inhabitant over there could have any sort of solution to the famines. We didn't find a man, but we got the solution alright.

I was being escorted into a large house on the outskirts of the city. It was a big, empty mansion, abandoned for generations according to the locals, who think it is haunted and avoid coming near it. Nevertheless, we had to comb the entire town, so someone had to go there. I, a fragile and valuable scientists sent to the front lines to find some way to grow food in the irradiated swamps that make up most of the world now, am accompanied by a small squad to keep me guard against any sort of dangers. They aren't very smart (to be fair, most of the smart people left in this world aren't anywhere near combat) but they provide good company. As we enter the mansion I order them to split up and search the house. If they are to see anything unusual - they are to report it immidiately. All protocol, we have done it a hundred times in the past year alone, and yet I always excited by the fact that I am giving orders to these armed men.

An hour passes and we find nothing, apart from a sprawling library in the basement. While we should move forward to more important targets, the idea of so many books untouched for such a long time intrigues me, along with my guards. We decide to call in a code 4057, which means we found something of interest and will be taking out time exploring it. We didn't expect finding much from the books, but it is a good distraction from the situation outside.

The library is beautiful, modeled after the old ones that were in medieval castles. My guards all pick up some fiction books and start reading to their enjoyment, which surprises me as I never saw them take leisure in books. I go around the bookshelves, searching for something more interesting than mere stories, when an odd book strikes my eyes.

It is labeled ""The Secrets of Life"", without an author. The cover is colored with a strong crimson color and gold linings, and it is huge, at least 3000 large pages. I don't know what prompted me to pick it up, the fact that it could be what we're actually looking for or the amazing aesthetics of its cover, but the moment I lift it up from the bookshelf a loud, rumbling sound is heard.

All of the guards spring to their feet, clinching their rifles reflexively, and turn to me. The bookshelf in front of me starts to turn, introducing a new, secret tunnel that is unlike anything I've seen before. Even though this was probably built thousands of years ago, the hidden tunnel looks like it's from the future. It is a shiny, chrome color with light-blue wires running along the ceiling. We slowly make our way deeper into the ground, when a huge door comes in front of us. I walk to a control panel nearby and pull a big-looking lever, the only intractable object I can see, and the door begins to open slowly sideways, into the wall. Behind it lies a large chamber, empty apart from a huge machine connected to the wires we saw before. The machine is just a cube, around 5 meters a side, with a large screen on the edge towards the door. As I approach it, a keyboard comes out of the cube and the screen turns on."

Our brothers and sisters fight on the front lines, our heroic civil corps construct roads larger than anything that existed before! Strong weapons of steel and flame churn victory for our revolution, crushing the petulant Vikings and the sour-souled Americans! Watch as they struggle to rebuild their ruins and farmlands! 

Our war is as ancestral as it is eternal! Our father's grandfathers marched in American lands, uniting the common worker and man under a Celtic flag! Our workers are the envy of all craftsman in the diseased Viking swamps! 

They challenge us with fanaticism and theocracy! We defeat them with weapons of destruction and burn their armies into the Earth! We have outgrown the simple belief systems of Gods and cherished the plight of the common man in our age of strife and dismay!

Long live the Celts! Long live our Revolution! Victory is but a short month away, my brothers, my sisters! Long live the idea of peace! When the war is over, our armies shall cast aside their weapons and work with the common man in rebuilding our world to her former glory!

The swamps shall be cleared, replaced with arcadian farmlands! The radioactive wastes cursed upon us by our vile enemies will be cleaned and replaced with vibrant cities like in the texts of old! 

No longer shall our children starve because of the decadent and foolish bourgeois enemy! No longer shall we see our once beautiful countrysides rot and waste away with our wives and daughters!

Stand with your brothers! Stand with the workers! Stand and fight the enemy! Only if we all work together can we finally end this righteous war!

We shall conquer and unite the worker of the world under our communal banner! We shall rebuild this world! We shall return to prosperity!

The expert was criticized for his poor translation and voluntarily elected for reeducation. In an act sure to inspire his brothers, Dr. Byrne has enlisted and is currently fighting bravely against the American and Viking enemy.  Remember, the educated do make mistakes, and the possibility of war of our ancestors a THOUSAND years ago is absolute drivel. The war's end is inevitable and rapidly approaching, stated the Party spokeswoman Ailis Kelly on behalf of the Chairman. Despite alleged growing unrest and rumors of food riots, the streets are peaceful and birth rates are higher than ever!

We live in an era of accelerated growth and prosperity!

Remember, the enemy thrives when you live in excess! 
Report all hoarding of rations to your local Party Official.
We all must tighten our belts for our fighting brothers and sisters!

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,">Try the 1700 year war. The three remaining nations have been locked in an eternal death struggle for almost 2000 years. Peace seems to be impossible. Every time a cease fire is signed, the Vikings will surprise attack me or the Americans the very next turn, often with nuclear weapons. Even when the U.N forces a peace treaty. So I can only assume that peace will come only when they're wiped out. It is this that perpetuates the war ad infinitum.

Read this as:

The Americans and the vikings have all but exhausted the resources of a world in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on a ravaged planet, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-09-13,"Thanks for sharing your Civ II gaming experience.  I am a long time player of Civ II, while I've tried Civs 3, 4 and 5 - I find Civ II to be the best.

I downloaded your saved game and in two nights of play, I was able to get things turned around in your favour.  Here are my tips:



Beginning the game…

I am the Celtic nation
Americans are strong and they are my Ally
Vikings are strong and an enemy
Incas are weak and also an enemy


Goal:

1)	Don’t piss off the Americans (your Ally) as I see a two front war as suicidal.  

•	Don’t totally wipe out the Incas, let them keep at least one city and then make peace.
•	Don’t make peace with the Vikings when the Americans (your ally) are at war with them.
•	Halt the use of any existing nuclear weapons


2)	Attack the Vikings in a non-nuclear, non-conventional method I call “Funding the Insurgents”

•	We will require gold to fund the insurgents, spies to deliver the gold and transports to deliver the spies.
•	Switch your government to Fundamentalism to keep your people from rioting and causing a civil disturbance, it also helps your cash flow – required to fund the insurgents (who are the pissed off Viking people). 
•	Stop all production of nuclear weapons, city improvements, have all your cities make armor.


Funding the Insurgents : Step 1 – Rattle the Cage

•	Begin building transports in costal cities like Hieraconpolis that are close to the Vikings as well as Spies in any cities connected by railroads to those coastal cities.
•	With a spy in a transport and a couple thousand gold, look for small cities like Trondheim.  It all must happen in one move, your spy should go directly to the city from the transport.  Select the bottom option – “incite a revolt” 
•	Take advantage of the Viking Railroad system to first cause revolts in cities furthest away.  This is important as Viking units will ‘take to the surrounding city areas’ – we don’t want to block any future Spy movement.
•	Once you take over a city sell one of the improvements to recoup your Coup d'état expenses.  The more money you get the better, the more useless the improvement the better.  Every turn you hold on to the city repeat the improvement selling.
•	The Vikings will be successful in liberating some of their cities.  They will fill them full of new troops to defend the city.  Feel free to incite a revolt once again, and now those troop are yours.
•	Eventually the Vikings will begin running low on troops to liberate their cities and they will change their government to a Democracy.  You cannot incite a revolt in a civilization with this type of government (in this game).  This completes the first step of the Viking down fall.

Attack the Viking Capitals: Step 2 – Chase His Government

•	The Vikings cannot maintain a Democracy for very long, it’s just too expensive and their people are going to begin rioting.  They’ve still got a lot of fight in them, but this is the beginning of the end. 
•	You could make peace with them, but don’t.  It will piss off the Americans who are your ally and still at war with the Vikings and you cannot afford a war on two fronts.  The Vikings can’t be trusted; sooner or later they will knife you in the back, they best solution is to conquer them.
•	Save your gold and try your best to hold on to as many Viking cities as possible.  
•	Continue to sell the unless city improvements, you should also consider doing this in your pre-existing cities too.
•	Put together a conventional army of heavy tanks, use them to attack the Viking capital city.  After you capture it the Vikings instantly move their capital, chase their government and attack the new capital.  Always try to avoid attacking Viking units unless unavailable – as each Viking unit outside a city make another citizen unhappy and unproductive.
•	In the year 4011 the Viking civilization was destroyed by the Celts, we have 20,180,000 people and 2,576 gold.
•	Somewhere along the way I took over 3 of the 4 Inca cities and made peace with them.


Reaching for Space: Step – Rebuilding the Earth

•	Many of the cities make a huge number of shields but have a small population, I decided to start the space race and I built a complete spaceship and it arrived at Alpha Century in the year 4046.
•	For the cities with enough wheat I built new settlers, we are very slowly changing the land back to pastures, I automate them all as I don’t like to micromanage.
•	I stayed allied to the Americans thought the game and the Inca and I have never broken our peace treaty.  While I have many Spy’s at the ready and attack plans drawn up, I will not initiate war on my peaceful neighbours as I don’t play that way.

-> increase population/working force 

-> more engineers

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Life long Civ 2 player here. 

Here's what you do:

*Switch to fundamentalism. 

*Stop attacking so that your enemies can rebuild their infrastructure.

*Build a city close to your front line and buy an SDI first. This will protect your front line units from being nuked. 

*Sell your libraries/universities/research labs 

*Once this is done, switch all your cities over to rebuilding in this order:

-Temple

-Granary

-ENGINEER

-Colosseum

-Marketplace

-Cathedral

-harbor

-ENGINEER

-Stock exchange

-Factory/Manufacturing/Recycling/Solar  

-Military (Walls, Baracks, etc.)

*Once you've rebuilt all your cities, begin manufacturing howitzers only. Send all of these to one city. Preferably the city closest to the nearest enemy. Hopefully, this city is within 6-7 spaces of the target enemy city.

*Once you have 100+ howitzers, build an equal amount of transports, in the same city.

*Once you have enough transports, bring in all your engineers. 

*Next turn, land on your enemy's city, bring in all howitzers and engineers. Take over his entire land mass in one turn to prevent counter attack. If he has multiple land masses, land on all of them at once. The benefit of not attacking him will be that they have begun laying down roads that your engineers (50-60) will be able to build on to ease the howitzers across cities. A good rule of thumb is 10 howitzers per city. 

Good luck and Spaghetti Monster Speed

EDIT: Formatting
EDIT: Here's another tip, let each city build for one turn so it pops on some shields. Then buy whatever you're building. This reduces the price by half, increases your output by city and should reduce the time it takes to get up to a full army. "

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"This is actually scary when you look at it from an emergent property perspective:

4) each empire militarily indestructible

5) all production needs to go to military and not the people

6) random nukes and explosions are common in the remaining urban areas, keeping fear alive

7) all three empires are iron-fisted dictatorships of some form

8) rotating alliances but no movement on the war front regardless of combination

Build houndreds of caravans (freights), try getting peace for maybe 20 turns, send all caravans (freights) and You will get much more gpt. With this gpt, build spies and buy cities. IIRC communism has some buffs to spies so just buy low-pop cities and from those low-pop cities buy tanks to conquer the rest.

Also, try sprawling more cities with pop 3/4, they are most efficient in Your case. Sell markets which provide You less than 2 gold, sell all libraries (and upgrades of those buildings).

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-13,"Man, this is worse then 1984. It's like this:

Take 1984, get in some WH40K grimdark, and FallOut (of course), and combine those. Now, put this cocktail in a microwave oven for an hour and you get this game.

Or, as a possible war scene would be:

There were nothing stopping those Celts, dressed in varying shades of green, from attacking his hometown, Wounded Knee, it seemed. Wave after wave of enemy infantrymen, tanks and helis approached the city like a massive starved beast looking to feast on some well-needed food. It was the offensive tactic that he had seen in so many campaigns - humanity's goverments no longer saw men as men, only as tools for the War.  

He and his fellow American comrades, all what he saw as believing and true Christians, were ready to defend as the soldiers commanded shouted over the rusty megaphone ""Fire the artillery, now!""

He soon heard thunderous noises emitting from the inside of the small city as artillery shell after artillery shell fired from the Pachtton cannons hit the advancing wave. Not that it stopped the Celts one bit as the wave came closer to the city. 

He had been fighting in this war since he was a child, due to official American policy. He was a veteran of similar charges, so the thoughts running in his mind were that if he survived, he would fight another day for America, the President and God. If he died, he would go to heaven. Nothing would stop him from killing in the name of defending his hometown.

The Celtic mass soon enough, not disturbed by the artillery barrages clashed with the American defense, and it was all man-to-man. It was all knife-to-knife, gun-to-gun combat as neither side were willing to use heavier weaponry. Only the Holy Order of American Engineers (and similar Orders in Viking and Celt lands) knew how to build houses anymore, and no one was willing to destroy what few available resources were left - good trees were scarce, after all.

As he slashed and shot his way against his Celtic opponents, something hit him. Undettered, he kept fighting on, despite the gaping wound in his left knee. Amongst this carnage, there was nothing stopping him. Almost all of his forefathers had fought in the War in ages past, why should he stop?

And just as he was back on his feet, he was shot in the neck. A friendly fire - as the soldier collapsed and died, still clutching his knife and rifle. No one would remember his name as the battle for Wounded Knee continued to rage. Official American accounts would not list the casualities from friendly fire. 

And in this world, as the War continues, humanity's hopes are all long gone, claimed by the swamps and the wastelands. The goverments are on the brink of disaster, food for the day for ordinary humans are something that only dreams can conjure, and the Golden Age of Technology are now just a very distant memory.

This world has now gone so far that official American Christianity has intentionally confused the legendary General Patton with Jesus Christ. If the War ever ends, no one will see it as a peace. The population of the world will only see it as a declaration of war against the War."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-13,"You've mentioned you have SDI in place, you have the max techs on all sides.  In games I've played in the past I've focused forces entirely into Tanks and Stealth Fighters supported by spies on land, and built Carrier groups with Helo's and stealth fighters on deck with Aegis escorts and a few transports filled with spies and tanks to follow.  (every turn you have to run fighters out in all directions to sub/spy hunt.  If you can use spies to bribe any incoming spies/units)  Of note you can use spies from transports to do this to enemy ships, just get the transport by the ship and activate the spy.  I also use spies on barbarian uprisings to bolster city units quickly.  I also disband those barbarian units to speed up tank/plane production.  In your core cities you should be able to move your bribed troops fairly quickly over rail and be sure to set their home city to keep the people happy if you don't disband them into more advanced units.  Your coastal cities should be you're largest producers because they are harder to pollute and easier to clean.

In a Scenario like this one I would throw all I have at one enemy capital at a time.  If I remember large empires in Civ have a chance to splitting into Civil War creating two enemies but weakening the greater one.  In turn you may gain an ally in the fight.  If you have SDI in place the perimeter of your cities should be defensible under it's shield.  Since you are using primarily tanks (3 moves per turn) you can kill rail between your outer fringe cities and your core inner cities.  Focus on getting the core cities back up to full, happy citizens set your luxuries at about 30% take science down to 0 since it's a waste of funds and put the remainder into the remaining production bracket.  You can always bump luxuries up to 40% if needed, happy people are productive ones.  I always push for Democracy if possible, spies are less effective against you.  On your outer fringes make sure only roads lead into your areas, and forests around them if you can terraform, this forces spies to use up their moves just getting to you and you can expel them back to their capital using helo patrols.  You basically need to limit their ability to access your core heartland and rebuild your main cities.  If you can get democracy up and running and get get the money flowing in big, use spies to bribe enemy spies that approach and use those spies to subvert smaller cities.  If you have the pyramids, sell your granaries and also sell the granaries of any city you subvert or conquer.  If you don't have the pyramids, you need to capture that city if the wonder still exists.  The key basic structures in any captured city should be SDI, Walls, and airport.  Once you have an airport use it to fly tanks (1 turn at a time) into the city to bolster it.  Also part 4-5 stealth fighters in the city to run patrols for spy hunting.  After that focus on building it's people needs, use the other cities to supply troops via air and or rail if you build it.  If you build proper defenses, you are fine if the enemy attacks first, if anything it forces them to over extend.  If you run vigilant air patrols and keep your cities properly buffered and keep units in the cities.  Stealth fighters are powerful and expendable, use them on a defense until they crash or are shot down.  You can kill 3-4 more units per unit if you don't fly them home again.  

Another trick I used to use when capturing cities is to use spies to subvert the the partisan units and pull them into the city defense freeing up my tank to roll further while also approaching for peace.  Never declare war, let them attack you, they will always offer peace and buy you time after they lose enough.  Never leave a stack of units on an open square always park them on hills and preferably into fortresses.  Use engineers to lead the way when possible.  If you're lucky you capture the city with SDI intact, if so park as many units as you can in that city until you can prep the next attack.  

Still going for the Capital with a carrier group and Helo's is usually the primary strike.  Since you will probably lose the units in battle or to nukes anyways, I will usually send my stealth fighters on 1 way trips, they attack until they crash or are shot down.  believe it or not it actually bolsters morale since that city is no longer supporting a unit far from home.  Seems like I was able to stack somewhere close to 20 units on a carrier back when I played, and sometimes would use two carrier strike forces, usually on opposite coasts so I could fly over and still have a friendly deck to land on if for some reason I was not kamakazing them.

So there you have it.  Build up your core, build large attack groups, focus on core power units, rule the air and strike at your opponent's heart and pray for a Civil War.  Push for Democracy and they will not be able to outproduce your industry.  Keep people happy and use luxuries as much as you can to keep them happy.  Also micro manage your cities along those lines as well, up taxes just enough and setup entertainers (Elvi)to keep your people rocking.  And be very vigilant of your borders, do not give your enemy a rail line in and expel any spies spotted from the air before they can get close enough to plant a nuke.  I will download the game when I get in from work and see if I can pull it off as well.  This late in the game a usual turn may take an evening to execute"

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-15,"I've almost won that game :D

My strategy:
1) pass to democracy
2) disband all military units, keep only one mechanic infantry to defend each city
2) create ingeneers in ALL cities, first irrigate to susteint the engeneer then it goes cleaning nearest polution
3) at the end each turn, try to discuss with war and cease-fire adversaries and offer them money. If they ask money to end the war always accept. They will still attack you times to times but that buys you time.
4) construct solar plant in as much cities as possible. Solar plants increarse tolerances to pollution, so that will compensate the pollution in adversaries terrain that you can't clean yourself.

You'll lose cities, and global warning will destroy the work of your engeneers a few times, but I'm now in 4086 and I won't have global warming anymore (the pollution indication dissapeared since a few years now) and none of the adversaries attacked me for at least 15years now. That's because my reputation improved, it's now ""Dishonorable"" :P

Currently my army is made of engeneers that irrigate everywhere around my cities, all of my cities are protected with SDI (nuclear weapon won't have any effect on me anymore).

I still need time to increase the productivity of all cities, then I'll mass-create hotwizers and there is no way other civilizations will survive :)"

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I posted this before on Reddit I think but let me tell you the best game of CIV 4 I ever had or a small time frame of it. Sorry for wall of text and you will probably not understand half of it unless you play civ. Also forgive my spelling grammar I kinda got tired and was just free rolling from memory it was an epic game though.

The year is not really that important because CIV games technological rates are dependent on many things. Technically speaking we are probably in the 1960's. No one has stealth tech yet.

There are 3 super powers sharing a continent. One 3rd world nation holding a continent to its self (ZULU) and 2 other civs that lag behind on tech sharing another content (Aztecs and Egyptians) .

Celts (Myself) A Democratic state with free religion holding 1/4 on the far left side of the northern continent. It is also the homeland of the worlds most popular religion Judaism) My state was previously a theocracy but due to United nations vote I was encouraged to intact free religion. My military is arguably the most powerful I have more Nuclear weapons than the Russians and I can also hit there city using attacks from Submarines. My navy is second to none. My army is however much smaller than the Russians.

I border a similar sized nation of similar wealth and technology America. They control the United nations through election but I house it in my second city. The Americans are the 3rd most powerful nation with a military half the sized of myself, they do not have nuclear weapons but are capable of producing them. They are also democracy with all the most liberal options and it was there first vote at UN that made me drop my Theocracy.

To the Americans right are the Russians who's country is slightly bigger than both American and celts(me) land. They are communist police state. They are pretty much communist Russia massive yet backwards. They have a massive regular army which they love placing all along the American border. Massive air force which they waste countless minutes to recon over America every turn and also nuclear weapons.

All three super powers have fought in the past before nuclear weapons but since the modern era things have been peacefull with well established borders. 

The Americans are friendly to me and the Russians but have an open border with myself and a defence pack. 90% of my army is stationed along the Russian/America border and 90% of my airforce is based in American cities too defend them encase Russia attacks.

It is clear that a war between me and the Russians would be Armageddon with neither side going to achieve anything kinda like OP's situation. It is too late for religious victory so my only options are space race or diplomatic victory because even taking the other civs lands would not give me land area or population victory because Russia is too big. 

I decide to win by UN vote even though I don't control the council I have the perfect plan to do so. I know Russia will never vote for me and will always vote for itself like wise I will do the same for voting for myself but I know America and the other civs could be bought.

So I start getting sweet with America accepting there trades with out bartering for better deals. I give my extra shitty food resources to the Zulu and bring them up to the industrial age in technology which wins them over.

I do the same for both the Egyptians and the Aztecs. I get voted into the UN and my first vote is to elect me as winner but sadly I do not get enough votes with pretty much every one abstaining except me and the Russians.

I Think no biggy lets just wait till these gifts start swaying them and I'll use my UN votes to force resolutions that bring us together, freedom of speech ect. Which the Russians defy which is good because it makes peeps hate them including America. SO I decide to change the other civs views by asking them and gifting them shit when they do which works. So we all have the same types of liberalish governments.

So roll on my vote ''yeah I'm gonna win'' everyone votes for me except the freaking Aztec wtf. Worse still the Aztec declare war and invade Egypt that turn, WTF again. So I decide to send a ''peace keeping'' force to Egypt and capture some Aztec city's until they surrender. My advanced navy and marines make mince meat of the Aztec army, establishing air bases in Egypt to bomb the crap out of the Aztec my marines quickly destroy all Aztec resistance they surrender and become a vassal state.

Roll on next election ''For sure its in the bag'' everyone votes for me except Russia naturaly and the freaking Aztec! WTF WTF I FUCKING OWN YOU SHITS.

Worse still I can't wipe them out they have surrendered it's just not possible, you can't undo the vassal unless they choose to. SO I'm like ahh games bugged dev error or someshit no way to win but then I realise I can win I simply need to de-legitimise there nation and create my own from there citys.

So I form Plan Israel. (no fucking joke I decide that to win I must make Israel who will of course support my UN vote)

I decide to make my new nation from captured Aztec cities renaming them Tel Aviv, Jerusalem ect. I even convert them to Judaism because I still gt gold for every Jewish city.

I provide Israel with everything it could desire I giver her 200 gold each turn I built loads of buildings in the city before I founded the state. (My plan is that Israel will declare war on the Aztec and wipe them out giving me the UN majority that I need [Israel is voting in support of me at the UN]).

Slowly Israel is taking over the Aztec cities through cultural absorption. I keep giving the Israeli cash to build cultural achievements.

I also demand every single piece of resource crap the Aztecs have knowing fine well that if they refuse the vassal state contract will be broken and I can bomb them to shit. I also discover that I can put large amounts of coin into sabotage against them and send like 30 spies to destroy every road, farm, building they have.

Finally the Israeli declare war against them but they are fucking useless and even manage to lose a city to the Aztec, WTF I gave you advanced military and you fail hard you dam cowards! After somehow losing a 3 turn war the Israeli make peace with the Aztec but then shortly after anoter wave of me now sending spies to destroy anything of value in the captured Israeli city the Aztecs break the vassal contract I march in wipe them out giving all there city to Israel. Israel who loves me ''+10 you granted us our independence and gave us citys''

All the while Egyp looks on not giving a shit so funny. Well anyway on the next UN vote I won.

In Short to win at CIV I had to become evil and support a rouge state as it wipes out another. Best game of Civ I've ever had.

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-11-04,"Okay, I'm not really familiar with Civ II, but I can see an obvious way to lift this stalemate and have the world rebuilt. 

It's so simple -- just surrender to one enemy (say, the vickings) while putting all your strength into a last batlle against the other (the americans). 
If I understand the game correctly, you should be out of the board quickly, and the vickings should then be able to take over America. Your and American people become vickings -- but that's not really a problem for them, since their main concern is to eat -- and already vicking engineers can start cleaning the mess you've contributed to create for 2000 years.

it will take a while to rebuild your military and your government will likely fall several times. keep after it eventually when you have a stable democracy money will flow to you better. 

then build up your forces near thier capitols. in one turn declare depotism so you dont have to worry about congress, attack thier capitols to splinter both thier empires. then turn back to democracy and use the diplomatic combo to force peace with them.

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I have been playing Civ 2 ever since it was released. I agree that you need to consolidate a core few cities and fix them with engineers. The outer cities are a buffer zone for the war. Go on a defensive, let the vikings expend energy attacking while you build up the revenge. 

But you have two main problems:
1. Most of the pollution is in Viking controlled teritory. It is possible to stop the global warming but you have to clear up all the pollution including that inside enemy territory.
2. Your supply lines are really really long. Your army has to move too far from your main cities to where your enemy is. Including bad ocean crossings where the army ends up sat on the shore for a while.

These two problems are wrapped in to one. Sort out the supply lines and you will be able to conquer the vikings and clean up the pollution. And then everything else is much easier. To do this you need to sort a few things out. 
1. Build coastal cities to move your army using transports between continents seamlessly. No military unit should EVER be left outside a city (or SDI defense is gone and they will get nuked or otherwise destroyed). Particularly you need a city north of edinborough near thebes. Build it 3 squares north of edinborough, that way any SDI defense in Edinborough will protect the new city and it can't be nuked on being built. Critically it is also within 7 sea squares of thebes so you can move units across in one turn. That is the big whole in your supply line and will allow you to strike quickly at the core viking cities. 
2. Get rid of all bombers, nukes, military ships etc they are too expensive and not effective enough. Build only howitzers, mech inf, transports, and engineers. They are the cheapest units and are also the most effective when used properly. Howitzers destroy cities, mech inf defend them, transports and engineers get the attack units to cities instantly. 
3. Build an enormous store of howitzers and mech inf and have them primed and ready to go. Hiding behind an inpentrable defense way away from the front line. Then when ready (100 howitzers, 100 mech inf or so and enough transports c.25 to move them to cities linked with railroads to the enemy in one turn) then you strike. And you take all of the major enemy cities in one turn.  

Also presumably you know that leaving a spy in a city is defense against spies planting nuclear devices. So you should have one in each of your cities alongside the usual SDI, city wall, coastal frotress, SAM battery defense. 

Oh yeah and you should definitely be in fundamentalism until this is sorted. Communism just won't cut it. Once you have extra cash you can start bribing enemy cities to convert using a small army of spies too. It will help mop up the outlying cities that are difficult to get a full army to. 

Hope this helps"

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,it scares me how unrealistically realistic this is.
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"First of all: kudos.

Its been ten years SINCE i've last played civ2. i loved that game. thank you for bringing up those memories!

now you've already read some good advice:

* switch to fundamentalism
* concentrate engineering power where enemies can't/unlikly will damage your investment
* if you cant do the latter, concentrate strategic effort on making this possible

i'd like to ad the following..

**martyr cites:**
if you feel like your engineers work is beeing wasted you should consider building new cities on neuralgic points (like sea gates, isthmus, train tracks, mountains, directly on enemy resources etc.) and back those settlers up with enough military so those cities become hard to enter and drain enemic resources. 

**new settlements:**
or you could check for unused land/ressources in your heartland and make it usable by building a city nearby, which would add to your production

also - and this is half blurred 10yr old memory half internet research...

**build bridges:**
another user mentioned terraforming land into ocean. i am not sure if i did that back then. but i am pretty sure that i had railroads on water. my internet research piled up something, that i remember doing. so i either unconciously making this up or might add a new strategic weapon to your arsenal: building railtracks on water. if you put a unit on a transport-ship it turns into sleep mode. this is the same thing a rocket does if you put it on a plane. you could, at all times wake up such a unit from its sleep. so i remember waking up engineers on the ocean and commanding them to build a road.

i really hope i am not making this up. can anyone verify on the ocean-road thing? i've found this old cheat list: http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2/cheats"

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-13,talking about replay value
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-13,Global warming? Dwindling population suffering from famine? Perma-war with nukes and guerilla revolts against the communist regime? Spies setting off bombs in the cities? A massive swamp world devoid of most life? This would make for an amazing book.
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-13,"I played a scenario one time that started with a single settler on a earth map, which has a pollution in every square. If I remember correctly, tundra does not turn into swamp, so that is where you want to settle, preferably coastal cities, since sea tiles still yield 2 food, 2 trade and 1 shield, even if the earth warms up a million times. That should give a massive production bonus over all size 1 and 2 inland cities. 

Furthermore, to stem the flood of tanks, switch to fundamentalism, start cracking out mechs (and maybe some fanatics) create a defensive perimeter around your cities with swamp (or mountain) forts, close enough to the SDI's to prevent them from being nuked, and make sure that the defensive line is closed, so no spy can get through. AI's usually will send everything they have against your line, but breaking through with tanks vs. swamp fort mech's shouldnt happen. The tithes from Funda should bring on some nice extra cash for now.

So then you will get time to work on a plan to finish the game. It depends on what you want to do. If you want to crush the opposition, build up your industry again, and start churning out stealth bombers, howitzers etc. until youre ready to blitz the enemy.

If you want to restore the planet and return to peace: stop nuking with spies, it gives -99 attitude (and I think -7 = max reputationloss, giving despicable rep), so it keeps the AI's at enraged level, making peace impossible. if you do that, and stop sneak attacking, just keeping bottled up behind your defensive line, peace should be possible again, in say 200 turns or so (until your rep gets back to -3 I guess). In the mean time, start cleaning up pollution (farming is useless until you can stop global warming from happening every few turns.) It depends a lot of the AI cleaned up its territory a bit, but I guess not if you constantly nuked them. If you stop, they should start doing that, if you attain peace with them, you can start helping them and you can start farming again, etc. etc."

I wish they kept some of these features like internal politics and guerilla warfare. I thought it would be cool if after barbarians they had terrorists or something, but I didn't know they had that in Civ 2.

So, for someone who hasn't been a gamer since the SNES when I was a lad, should I go Civ II or Civ III? My computer isn't old, but it's rubbish so I won't be able to play anything release at all recently."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Civ II was always my favorite.  Because the graphics were all 2D, anyone with some art skills could create custom units, and thus the internet had a ton of them available.  I barely even played the actual game, but I created so many custom scenarios.  Custom units for every civilization, and I'd populate the entire world with built up cities and units, making for some super strong civs.  Probably rarely ever finished a game, but I easily spent more time with Civ II than any of the other iterations of it."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Very cool. For a laugh, you should email the devs with a link to this reddit post of yours, and let them know your plight. I'm sure the creators of civ2 would love to hear your story about the game that's gone on for ten years. "
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Simply put there is no hope fore peace due to the massive amounts of nuclear attacks so you need to crush your enemies. I don't know the size of the map but if it is a larger map let them get into your territory with a stack of doom. Then nuke the stack of doom. Because they are in your territory they won't heal as fast making it easier for you to destroy the stack of doom. Again being in your territory he also won't be able to reinforce his stack. 

After that you need to assess the situation can you counter attack did you destroy enough of his units to take a city? Or maybe just enough to raze on? Or use the time to build up a larger stack of doom to use later. 

But try to stay defensive keeping your stacks out of site and away from boarders so they are harder to nuke. It is a war of attrition so conserve your troops and only attack when you know you can win. Destroying a city hurts his production giving you and edge in number of troops eventually allowing you to actually keep some of the cities giving you a production edge over the third guy.  


another very risky strategy is to give away cities to one enemy so you only have a front against that one enemy allowing you to take some of his cities in another area. This is very dependent though on how the map looks. "

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"You have to suck up to one of the remaining leaders, give him stuff and accept any request he makes short of giving up cities. Conquer a city from the other enemy and give it to the leader you want on your side. Do it enough and he'll side with you in destroying the other leader. Once the war with the other guy begins, save your troops and let the other guy attack the other nation. Once you've seen he has lost enough troops, blast him."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,I'd destroy any City I capture thus weakening your enemy and pushing the front lines further in to their territory. I'd also create lots of my own cities to give them more targets and take the pressure of my big cities and also ally myself with one enemy. 
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"The thing I always did in Civ 2 was immediately move to a theocracy.  It will eliminate your problem with guerrillas (meaning more troops for the front line).  Any building you make that brings happiness will give you extra cash - which you can use for more troops for the front line.  It might make a difference.  Then again, maybe not."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Your CivII game sounds a lot like a Sins of a Solar Empire game I have perpetually saved.  Of the 10 starting nations, 3 have allied with me, 6 were wiped out, but the one that started in his own system just will not die.  He is fully upgraded and very much the equal of my force.  I can't move into his 2 currently occupied systems without losing one of mine.  It has been a stalemate for 400+ hours, out of this 900+ hour game.

I don't play it so much anymore, because every time I try a new strategy, he goes for the kill and gets damn close.  It doesn't help that the 3 allied are useless and have been regulated to becoming resource gathering empires to fund my war effort.

Maybe one day I'll end it for the good of the galaxy, go out in a blaze of glory attacking his homeworld.  I may not kill him, but I'll wreck that damn planet."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,WWED: What Would Ender Do
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"just the fact that this is a 10 year old match is pretty neat, but finding other people so passionate and willing to try and save this fictional world is giving me goosebumps. "
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"The same scenario happened to me but on an adjusted ww2 map. I removed the turn limits since 4 years was not enough and I made Spain a playable character (me). I was making ground and made a spear/shield army. Shield=mobile infantry, Spear=Howitzers. I only had a few tanks just for pillaging raids and to eliminate weakened defeated soldiers. I had conquored france and most of north africa. I was doing well with one exception: Russia.

If anyone had ever played this map before, you know, once Russia builds railroads to connect her empire, the game is almost done. With rods you get a few turns delay for resupply, enough to make ground, but with near instant transport with so many cities, they can spam you to death with guerrillas. I was at war with everyone and Germany was easy enough to destroy but they were my buffer against Russia. So, I devised a plan and it is to this day my best war stratagy I ever came up with.

I made peace with England. I needed the seas and I couldn't do so with constant air attack from the island. And I made transports. Lots and lots of transports. And, to cover the stacks, three battleships and the AEGIS crusiers. I made three navy stacks and loaded my entirer army into them and sailed to the Baltic. Once I got there, I lost one stack to a nuke. Most of the army survived and in just one turn after landing, I cut a swath of destruction strait to Moscow and took it, then my whole army was wiped out next turn. 

I had won though. When you take a capital in some scenarios, civil war can break out and from where there was one nation, there are now two locked into a permanent war, at least, I think its permanent, I never saw them peace. Russia split. Now China was on the map and Russian and it are nuking the bejeezus out of each other. Germany is making ground in the east and England dropped the treaty with me and is bombing Paris. I am losing Italy to Germany and have already lost Amsterdam. I have no army so I am stalling until I can rebuild. Then comes Global warming. What follows was 100 turns of hell.

Just like in your scenario, everything turns to swamp. I manage to keep a few roads out of Spain but for the most part, my Europe holdings are lost. England and I do well since we have a majority of ocean cities. I go communist, just like you, so does England. The mainland empires go Theocratic. I still have my Mediterranean holdings and they help my cities survive the fundy unit onslaught. I have no idea the battle raging in the east but I think China is winning since they have only one war front. With all roads protected with a dedicated mobile infantry unit on every road plot, I can bring in howitzers. Without roads, I falter. It ends in a stalemate. I didn't play it for 10 years, but honestly man, thinking back, I wish I did. Kudos to you man. I haven't thought about this great game in awhile. "
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"A few main tips for what I did in late-game war:

Build rail.  It takes (I think) 8 engineers to built railroad in a square in one turn.  If the square has no roads, that's ten engineers.

Use the rail to drive artillery.  Use only one of the artillery's moves in attack each turn.  Take it home to a ""safe"" city after the one attack.

You'll find a sweet spot city *without* SDI that's close to another that *has* SDI.  This sweet spot, let's call it ""bait"" is what the enemy will try to nuke.  Place enough units in there to lure the nukes.

Utilize the artillery to soften a city.  If you can't take it in one turn; don't.  When you capture the city, don't garrison it with very many units *unless* it has SDI.  It could end up as your new bait city.

Every turn, your priority should be to kill any enemy units in the field.  Artillery is your friend.  *But keep the artillery on the rails.*  Period.

After the enemies in the field are dead, soften cities.  

There will be friendly cities that they know they can't nuke (SDI) and are heavily garrisoned.  Let them break their teeth on these cities.  Punish the survivors with your artillery.  Don't leave your own toys out in the yard to be stepped on.

Patience, and railroads."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-27,"Child, you developed  a sort of empire matched only by nature itself.  You threw yourself into a calm world of primeval nature, and from it you wrenched one of the greatest empires that I have yet to encounter. You watched as empires rose and fell around you. You built upon the broken bones of your enemies and you conquered all others. As the world ran its violent course, as the will of men conquered nature and physics itself, you have risen to the moniker of demigod. Hewn from bone and granite and fire and blood is your empire of empires. You are rivaled only by the foolish and the brave; for they choose to stand against your might. You have ravaged the very earth with the tooth and steel and fire and acid you crafted to save it with...

But...

Why, do you continue along this violent path? What do you believe it could possibly accomplish? This once grandiose land is no but a pox ridden scab of itself, with nary a blood vessel to with the wound meaning. This struggle - while to the incompetent minds of your species is epicurean - is absolutely trivial to the workings of space and time. You seek to expand across your planet, but what will remain after its time has come? You claim to seek peace for your plebeians, but is it truly worth - to you - to cast them into the very void you wish to save them from?

 I have watched curiously for a day - long before you gained the capacity to comprehend your own meager existence - as you tore at each others throats in the defense of yourselves and your beliefs. You were, and always will be, ignorant beyond even my infinite knowledge. You seek the answers to questions that you refuse to comprehend. 

When you fall - and fall you *will* - I will learn from the mistakes I made when I carved your existence from the very granite of life. 

I do not know why I continue to create life. Perhaps it is to one day see it overcome the weights I have placed upon its shoulders and to conquer the greatest empire of all…

I haven't played civ II in a long time, but maybe load up a few transports with spies? I can't recall how the spy+nuke combination works, but attempting an amphibious landing of spies far behind enemy lines while avoiding their navy could work in your favor? Than spread them out into the cities and take several out? The computer will either try to counter you in the sea at that moment or pull units from the front lines which you could take advantage of.

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"If you build cities nearer to choke points and get the anti nuke thing up, you can keep troops at the choke point so spies can't get in. That should allow a build up and you should be able to go on the defensive for a bit.

From there, start using engineers to clean up your homeland, build grainaries or capture the pyramids. Cleaning up pollution(fallout) will slowdown the global warming, unfortunately, the AI doesn't care about it, but getting rid of it in your homeland should slow it down a lot. It seems you have a majority of the land anyways.  

After you get production up, you just need to start an arms race and blitzkreig one of the sides (vikings) then you should be able to steamroll the other.

You shouldn't enact a plan without knowing your enemy. Setting aside the life we give these AIs they're just that, artificial intelligences. They are playing based on static logic trees.

My suggestions? Figure out which AI personality was applied to the Vikings and what is triggering their ""attack even in treaties"" action. If you know that you can counter, lull them into a peace and then destroy them."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"First of all this is great, but it looks unwinnable. Its been a while since i've played Civ 2 but here's what i'd try first:

Switch to fundamentalism and start spamming fanatics everywhere. You'll want to focus on getting the americans off your continent, so create walls of fanatics around Cyre and north of Timbet for them to waste turns destroying while you switch over a couple of your larger cities, or higher production cities, to create loads of spies. Keep your fanatics replenished.

Once you have a large enough spy army infiltrate nuke all of their cities on that continent in a single turn. Move around the rail network and capture them all with one unit. If you have enough fanatics left, move them around pillaging all of your own railways near your south coast. They'll probably win half or more of the cities back on the next turn so repeat build your spy army.

If by some miracle this works and the continent is yours, quickly build a couple of transports in Chicago, Kansas City and Tintagel, then enough paratroopers to capture the island in a single turn. Another spy army and paradrop in destroying the hated american civ.

Similar strategy for the vikings, but you'll now have a production advantage over them."

You have to dedicate a couple cities production to something other than tanks. Clean the pollution and farm the land. Then you can have your one or two productive cities send freight(one of the things I miss that didnt make it to later games) to build other cities populations.

If you do get a city cleaned up and productive, man every space of the map in the city limits with workers or spies or anything really so in the event of an uprising they can't destroy your only food source.

How many cities do you have? Maybe you could close ranks and destroy a few on the outsides of the empire so you have less to defend, but only if you have them to spare.

Take the entire stacked fleet out to sea. You can stack pretty much anything on top of this and it will be indestructible. Put the Stealth Bomber on top to prevent nuclear attacks ( ONLY fighters can attack stealth bombers in Civ II ). This will force your enemies to waste inordinate amounts of shields producing cruise missiles and fighter jets to hit this unstoppable force. It will be a cruisemissile attractor/absorber. They will even, due to an obscure bug, fly cruise missiles next to this stack fleet and end their turn without them crashing. Shoot these down. 

Gradually build up fully loaded troop transports with howitzers underneath this stack. It will take maybe 20 years, but eventually you will have a Gigantic army. Invade."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"DonutEF's plan would work well. However the time to build the engineers and reform your land would indeed be a little daunting. I have another suggestion.

Stage 1:

You say that the stalemate exists because any conventional forces that make any progress get nuked right? So what you could do is make a chain of cities from your front line to wherever you want to attack first. Found another city on the edge of an existing city, just within the protection of the SDI defence. Then build only defence appropriate structures (ie baracks, city wall and SDI defence). It will be more of a forward outpost or fortress rather than a functioning city. Load it chalk full of mobile infantry and tanks etc. Also maintain and move your frontline forward, idealy air tight so no spy's can sneak through and nuke your forward city. Rinse and repeat. 

Side note: To attempt a sure chance that you will conquer a city, bulid one of these ""forts"" either right outside the boundry of an enemy city (so your units can be SDI protected while being next to or close to an enemy city); or even within an enemy cities borders (though im not sure what sort of stance you have standing with your foes, if it is anything but war i think they will ask you to remove units from the vicinity and thus it wont be possible).

Stage 2:

You will have to have build a rediculously large arsenal of howitzers at this point, i would say 100+. Once you have turtled your way to their front lines, start sending in the howitzers. It is imperetive that there be an unbroken railroad connection to your first target. Howitzers have 2 actions possible per turn right? So simply send in a Howitzer, use 1 action to attack, it will almost surely destroy the target its attacking, then retreat it back to the safety of the closest SDI defended position. Rinse and repeat until you run out of howitzers. Worst case scenario you destroy close to 100 enemy units without losing many howitzers. With enough repetitions you will out produce your enemy until you can consistently hold cities. 

Side note: when you conquer a city it seems a random amount of city improvements will be left behind, if the sdi defence is still standing you can make that your forward outpost, have 10+ mech infantry ready to move in and defend and build a city wall and buy the completion that turn. (Im sure you've realised but disbanding a unit from within the city view, while it's in the city will give you 50% of the shields it cost to make. Disbanding a useless unit, or at least an expendable one will vastly reduce the amount it costs to force complete a city improvement).

Continue until victory. 

I haven't played nearly as far into the future as you have but due to the cities being in ruins and the length of the conflict, the enemy army can't be SO large so within 2 or 3 turns you should be able to just conquer half of their cities in 1 turn. 

Depending on the production possibilities of your cities, reforming the land to increase production may be necessary to build the amount of units you would need. So DonutEF's strat would likely come into play.

Hope this is clear enough :S And I just want to say this is an amazing post. Im SO going to dig up my old civII saves and check them out :)

This is what gaming is all about, taking the rule sets given to you and making your own experience out of it. Cinematic gaming has its place, but THIS is what got me hooked into gaming and it's the only thing keeping me in any more.

God bless you and God bless that guy from 4chan who made the never ending slow, boring, death rollercoaster. "
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Switch to fundamentalism. Build billions of fanatics, and surround yourself with them. They cost nothing to maintain and will absorb a lot of damage, especially on fortification squares. You can pop one out per city, per turn, easily. Then get your land back to normal with engineers, until you can be productive again. Then get busy stockpiling tanks, nukes, and cruise missiles. Produce and stockpile them for years, then when they're least expecting it, annihilate the others."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"The key will be to form an alliance with whatever other nation you've pissed off the least. Give them money, buy them nice things, compliment their wardrobe.  Use this alliance to smite the remaining enemy, you can't count on your ally pitching in much until the enemy is weakened so try to save up units in cities and wait. When the time is ripe let out all your units from your cities, kind of like all those meddlesome midgets coming out from under that big ladies dress in the nutcracker. If you stagger your enemy that should be incentive for your ally to pitch in for garbage time (two front war, yeeeah buddy). You can also try inciting revolts to weaken and then take cities or simply build new cities (and buy Sdi units ASAP) simply to advance your line. Oh and try to comitt a good amount of your forces to air units, their range will help you take out relief units behind the front line.  I love this game, good luck and god speed.

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,In the grim darkness of the far future there is only war
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I'm going to start this tomorrow with Civ5, should be good, just casually set to domination only, will update in 10 years"
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,I have an idea for a book.
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I doubt if the people in this world even have any concept of ""peace"" anymore.  The idea that the world could exist in anything other than a constant state of war and nightmarish suffering is probably as impossible to them as the idea of utopia is to us.  There are probably cults that talk about how the war could end if everybody would simply stop fighting, or if one nation would sacrifice itself.  It's probably accepted fact that beyond 25 the likelihood that you're still alive decreases dramatically.
My advice would be to play the war out for a few more million years, until everyone develops evolutionary defenses against radiation."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"OK, you have two major issues that need to be resolved.  First your land is useless.  Second you have aggressive untrustworthy neighbors with no compunction for using nukes.  

Looking at your map I would say it's time to resettle some of your cities near whale resources which provide a lot of food and sheilds relative to anything else you have available and target enemy cities near mountains, hills and whales with nukes early and often when they declare war on you.  This should limit the enemy ability to generate new military units while simultaneously boosting your ability to rebuild your civilization.  

Secondly I would surround your most important cities with really junky units, (partisans, riflemen whatever is cheapest) this should hopefully minimize the amount of nuke planting that spies can do to your best cities.  This will also give cover to your engineers as they clean up the space around the city and try to improve the terrain.  I would simply pick one civilization that is the easiest for you to beat and simply attempt to wipe them off of the map.   (In your case that would be the Americans) Fight only defensive wars against the other civilization until the first one is finished.  At this point the only way to improve their diplomatic ""feeling"" towards you after so many treaty violations on both sides is to consistently fight one common enemy and to not declare war on them anymore.  Every time the Vikings declare war on the Americans, join in.  Every time the Americans declare war on the Vikings declare war on the Americans.   You have to find a way to shake up the dynamic so that hopefully you can come out with something like 60% of the eventually conquered American territory.

I see you have what is a lot of gold, I would use that to buy a lot of engineers, paratroopers and the occasional transport vessel.  Indeed land forces are overrated.  I would personally put a lot of effort into destroying every possible road that leads to you and the Vikings.  Let them march through the swamp.  This should slow up a lot of their armies and give you time to marshall your forces on the border if that is necessary to prevent an attack.  Focus your energies on bombers, paratroopers and alpine troops that can move quickly over roadless terrain and them make them attack you or take advantage of the tank's relative weakness on the defensive.  You may lose a lot, but it will slow them down and open them up to a lot of pounding with your air power.  You can often  detain an invading army using this tactic and make your stronger enemies sue for peace.  

Doing these things will hopefully simultaneously make the Vikings more apt to like you and less effective in harming you while you gain strength and prepare to take enough territory from the Americans and eventually the Vikings to prevent global warming kicking in every so often.  At this point the land can begin to heal and you can focus on building pollution decreasing improvements in your cities that are farther away from the front lines.  The healing will begin.  This will take a lot of time given the circumstances you have.  The land may never heal, but you can get out of the eternal hell of perpetual war you are playing with."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"It's funny that the UN can force anything when there are only three nations and they are the ones fighting. Still, seem about as effective as they are in our world."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,Very Orwellian outcome
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I once played a game of Civilization II where I decided to see what would happen if you pushed global warming to the extreme.  I polluted like crazy and then started multiple nuclear wars.  With the fallout in my own territory, I ignored it until climate change occurred.  Again and again, pushed way beyond what the designers intended.  I wanted to see how far it went.

In the beginning, change was gradual - a square would turn from grasslands to plains, from plains to desert.  I kept going.  It didn't happen near the pollution - it was random.  The rest of the world seethed, but could do nothing against my superior armies.  Eventually, the entire Earth became swamp, the worst possible land terrain.  Farms and mines were sunk, and people starved.  Every city in the world fell to 10,000 population.  Armies were disbanded due to lack of food.  Wars stopped due to lack of armies.  Buildings were sold due to lack of taxes.  A sea of swamp with tiny, powerless settlements dotting it here and there.  The world had ended.

But I cheated.  I kept a slave laborer and fed them nothing.

In Civ2, you could capture enemy workers - and they wouldn't have a home city that had to support them.  While I lost everything else, my one slave laborer sat waiting, until the last square became swamp.  

Then I began to drain the swamps and make good farmland.  My capital city began to rebuild itself.  Soon it was able to churn out more workers, and they cleared even more land.  I rebuilt buildings, created an army, but did not attack.  Soon my people outnumbered the rest of the world a hundred to one, and rising.  

Then I lost patience and took over the rest of the world with a single tank.  But that's civilization for you.

1. Make lots of spies.  Lots and lots of spies
2. Target a single enemy.  Use multiple sabotage on several of their cities, shrinking them to the point where it is inexpensive to incite rebellion.
3. Fortify a spy in each of these cities to prevent it from happening to you.  Build an SDI if it was destroyed in the rebellion.  Move on to the next set of cities.
4. This is easier if you're in Fundamentalism and have a good income.  It presumes that your foes haven't got spies fortified in their cities."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-13,A strategy I tried was to churn out veteran spies. If you keep sending them in to sabotage production and destroy improvements they grind the others into producing no new units. Spies have a decent survival rate so after a while you build up quite a lot. Once you can stop the nuclear production the tide should start to turn.

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-07-15,10 years in civ... I love your willpower
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-07-16,"Well, most of these have been said in some way, shape or form, but here's a few ideas.

1. Stabilise your cities with harbours and offshore platforms. Guaranteed food and production regardless of global warming, live off the sea.
2. Build engineers and clean up your mess (they're useful for something). The AI players will clean theirs up and after a century or so the melting icecaps cease. Know the rules. Only pollution squares count for global warming and it takes 9 pollution squares or more to initiate it. Even with more it takes a while.
3. Sit and rebuild. The current fortress position is easily defended. You can easily kill any viking land units with half a dozen bombers while they waste their bombers on fruitless attacks on defended cities. If you stop attacking and they can't find an easy target, they'll give up on nukes.
4. Sun Tzu: Avoid war. If it is necessary, achieve your objectives quickly so you don't wear the population out. When you're ready, launch short sharp campaigns. Clear the area with bombers, buy small cities and take the big ones with howitzers. The Viking cities have many buildings, they will be essential to fight the americans so the less casualties the better.
5. Sun Tzu again: Understand yourself, understand your enemy. The Vikings are aggressive, they will keep fighting so you will have to take them out first. The americans are expansionist, leave them alone and they will ally with you against the Vikings, just don't let them get too powerful, or aim to outgrow them.
6. Believe it or not, I actually recommend democracy as soon as the climate stabilises and you have a few engineers. Democracy allows faster population growth.

Well, I'm not going to win in 58 years but here's a story of long term strategy:
The celts hold firm in Hieracanopolis
After a century of war and engineers clearing the pollution, they stabilise the planet
A few daring raids and several viking cities fall in succession. They nuke one, but promptly lose it again.
The fledgling celtic republic arises, slims down its army and rebuilds while just holding the line.
A series of short campaigns then the Vikings begin to request peace treaties, which they promptly break. The americans ally against the vikings.
As the population grows, an army of engineers terraforms the celtic cities.
The celts usher in democracy and become the most populous race.
The Americans wipe out the Sioux and the last Viking city while the celts conqure the viking heartland, utilising captured cities and military forces to accelerate their campaigns. The viking cities are a veritable industrial powerhouse and boost the power of the celts.

And the real war begins....
The Celts strike first and within a decade, more than a dozen american cities fall, including the old viking island. (Every city the sneaky american former allies built to infiltrate the celtic heartlands fell in the first year).
The americans hit back hard with their superior military of over 500 units and the war lurches back and forth.
Damaging periods of revolution and battles are interspersed with peace to refill the coffers and patch up battle-worn bombers and artillery.
Sensing they are losing the advantage, the americans retaliate deep into the celtic heartland island cities with a volley of nukes and slam the recently lost old viking cities in the northeast, temporarily halting the celtic campaign and restoring equilibrium. Engineers swarm and the pollution clears. The celts diligently invest in SDI.
The advantage shifts back and forth around Ephesos and Satsuma and the americans again resort to nukes to take the advantage. 
In the celtic and old viking heartlands, city after city hits its straps and turns to full military production, battleships and bombers roll off the production lines while mega cities support numerous units....
The Celts make peace for a decade then boot the americans from the celtic motherland decisively with their new forces. 
The celts have not used (nor built) a single nuke, and the americans have depleted their arsenal.
The war is slow and bitterly fought, but the tide is beginning to turn. The american navy swells, but the miltary has been halved by the war. The celtic army alone has outgrown the entire american military.
The UN ushers in a new uneasy peace.
Almost 100 celtic stealth bombers stand by to rain death from above, while a second carrier battle group gathers for a new offensive as the battleground shifts to a war between islands.....

Enjoy

How often had one of their accursed accolytes carried a nuclear device into one of America's few remaining ""cities"" to perpetuate the madness of this never ending war?
There was only one way: an alliance with the godless Celts. Although it made his blood boil to think of allying with those pale-skinned, blue painted Commies, he had to admit that they were at least rational. Perhaps Comrade Llewellyn could be persuaded to join his ancient enemies in a final battle to eliminate the greatest existential threat to humanity itself that had come to exist in nearly two millenia of pitiless combat: the insane Viking Cult of Hel."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I have a game like this going on in Civ 5 (although I've only been playing it for four consecutive days). Turn 800~, playing Epic on Large map. Three nations left (plus me, which makes four). One of them (Japan) is only down to one city and will lose it as soon as Songhai grows a pair. The only problem is that America is bordered to the north of them and keeps hitting them.

I, on the other hand, started on my own small Australia-like continent and then moved on to the other second mainland (I'm playing Continents) where I destroyed the Iroquois, the French, and the Chinese. I've also settled the Southeast Asia-like chain of semi-small islands/continents that surround America/Songhai/Japan. They're all at war with one another struggling to pump out armies to fight off invaders.

In the mean time, I'm building up a massive invasion force consisting of mechanized infantry, modern armor, mobile SAMs, gunships, and rocket artillery. The precursor to landing the ground forces will be a small trio unit of a missile cruiser, a destroyer, and a battleship group that lead the first assault and to repel any attempts to get at my transports. Oh, and each missile cruiser is loaded with nuclear missiles (which will be the first strike). Three nukes to each missile cruiser and there's eight, which makes 24 nuclear missiles.

Essentially I intend to wipe out all of their forces in one turn (maybe even some of their cities) and then ""launch the ships!"" before they can even really do anything. I predict I will win the game in 15 to 20 turns after the first strike."

* nobody is ever unhappy ever for any reason
* 8 units supported from each city
* happiness buildings give you money instead

Beyond that I would suggest concentrate on getting your cities functional again by spaffing out as many engineers as you can and setting them to clean up the mess that is this world. Don't build roads towards the enemy; find a defendable position (line of fortresses on a mountain etc) so they can't advance on you, and hopefully waste a lot of units attacking your nigh on impregnable defence. This should buy you enough time to clear up your territory and start mass producing howitzers. Forget nukes, what you want is the good old stack of death. I have no idea how well defended the cities will be, but if 100 howitzers and enough engineers to instantly connect to their railroad network can't win you some ground I don't know what will."

I instinctively press the ""Enter"" button and a presentation begins on the screen.

Apparently, the mansion belonged to one of the wealthiest men alive in history. I couldn't really understand how he did earn his fortune, but it was something to do with Quantum Computers, a technology long outdated. In the year 2012, which was 1979 years ago, there was some international panic from a predicted solar storm which would ""end humanity as we know it"". The owner of this mansion built this machine, which is a huge database, to serve as a testament to human advancements in case civilization would be wiped out. The presentation goes on to explain how to navigate the database, and then fades to white as a nice looking menu pops out.

The screen presents me with four options: ""Browse Categories"", ""Search Entries"", ""Replay Introduction"" and ""Export Data"". Without hesitating I search ""swamp vegetation"", only to find an entry about the long extinct Eucalyptus tree, which was used in the past to dry up swamps. Apparently back in 2012 no one even attempted to grow food in marshes. I try to search for more solutions, but find nothing I can use. Just as I am about to give up and report the whole area so other scientists can drool over the historic database, I have one idea. An idea that proves to be the key to ending this war.

I simply search for ""World War"", and find 3 main entries. ""World War 1"" and ""World War 2"" were two large-scale conflicts in the 20th century that are as good as ancient history to me, but what catches my eye was an entry titled ""World War 3"". It describes a hypothetical war, identical to the one that has been going on for the past 1500 or so years - nuclear holocaust, completely global, likely never to end. And then there is a section named ""theorized solutions"".

Reading this completely baffles me. I mean, it seems so simple that I just can't believe nobody though about it before. In the time this database was composed, this third world war seemed close than ever with the rise of the country Iran as a dictatorship, which aimed to build nuclear weapons. To combat this while not starting a war so big, Western Civilization would develop ""computer viruses"" which disabled the nuclear facilities and halt Iran's advances.

Now, cybernetic warfare is nothing new, but a specific virus, launched in the summer of 2012, caught my eye. Codenamed ""Phantom"", the virus didn't target Iran's nuclear facilities, but rather the personal computers of the people who worked there. The virus implemented specific pop ups and advertisements in those computer which sub-consciously turned the workers and scientists against the government. Then, using undercover agents, the western countries sparked a small revolt, which usually would not make a dent to the government. However, as the revolt broke, the nuclear facilities' employees immediately joined, brainwashed by the virus, and thus the rebels got hold on nuclear technologies. The government quickly fell, and the war was averted.

The problem with using viruses was that now, important facilities can't be breached - virtual security is just that good. However, the Average Joe doesn't have access to that kind of security, so this plan could work. This could mean the end of the war. The rebirth of humanity. I explain the situation to my squad, and they all agree we must contact a high-ranking officer ASAP. We run outside, but as we enter the library we hear explosions above. We exit the house, only to be greeted by a missile launched from a drone up above.

As I lie near a bush, I manage to get a glance around. My guards are all dead, most of them mutilated beyond recognition by the missile. We must have spent a few hours down there, because it seems like the Celtics are launching an assault to capture the town again. As everything around me blurs out, I realize that with our death, the information of the virus will be lost until someone else visits this mansion, and now, seeing as it's mostly destroyed by the offensive, seems highly unlikely. If this war is going to end, it would be thanks to something else. It's funny, I just read how this ""World War 3"" is likely to never end, and as I was about to finish it, the same war made sure that it would keep on going. I look back at the mansion, now collapsing, before I black out, probably for good this time."

Overall, it wasn't a half-bad story.

It had an intereting premise that corresponded to the Civ 2 post. 

I think you could expand on this *a lot* more and I might have to do so if you don't want to (I'd be happy to collaborate on something). 

Possible directions:

* Develop this unnamed character more

* Flesh out the taking of the city. I'd persoanlly have a bit more fighting in the beginning but a bare-bones approach would be to detail the surroundings, the ruins, the mansion, etc.

* Cut out the convenient plot devices. I understand for this it's okay but an expansion needs a deeper, more rich experience. 

* The 2nd part of the post felt rushed and anti-climactic (no offense). But, I can understand you probably just banged this out over the course of a few minutes so I don't hold it against you ;)

My creative wheels are turning. Damn this cubicle I sit upon while I wait to return home and fantasize about this world. 

"
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I apologise for the rushed job, but I hope you like my expansion of the original story.

——

We hadn't expected the Americans to take back Chicago. Legend has it us Vikings took it from them almost four centuries ago, and it's so small and insignificant they had never bothered retaking it. I'd been there a couple of times, and from what I can gather from the ruins and the myths of the citizens it was once a magnificent city made of glass and steel. Skyscrapers rose thousands of feet above the millions of citizens bustling about their daily lives in the streets below. That is, if one city's population could ever hold that much. But that's what people say, 72 million was one of the largest apparently. Hard to believe when you look around these days, even at our capital, which struggles to support less than 100,000.

Yeah, these days. ""The Never Ending War."" How can something be never ending? Oh well, that's not for me to think about. I get my rations for being a fighter, not a thinker. I've heard scientists have it pretty good; don't have to get dirty on the front line, decent amounts of food, I've even heard some have started families, an opportunity no soldiers get. Families? They're a thing of the past. Apparently children are smarter if they're conceived naturally and then modified, whereas us soldiers, we're just clones. It's always fun to join a new unit, look around and three of the 14 people look exactly like you.

And then we all have numbers; no names. I'm #11155353. It's nice that my numbers form some sort of pattern, though I don't get much time to think about that, what with the fighting.

I suppose ""The Never Ending War"" is sort of accurate, a soldier will never get more than a days rest once they're back from the front lines. *If* they get back from the front lines. Our superiors seem to forget that clones are still human. Thousands upon thousands of lives are lost almost on the hour. Not like that matters to them. A thousand clones aren't hard to make, and they can be on the front lines as soon as their transport gets there after the three days training and growth.

And I suppose that leads nicely up to where we are now. I was on my break in Vancouver, meeting up with some new spawns, when the intel that the Americans were launching an assault on Chicago came in. And just like that we were off.

We got there too late, of course. The Americans had occupied the city. Not that that was bad or different or hard, we'd just go in and take it back, just like they'd done the day before, and happens to most of the other cities on this planet daily. There was no point using missiles. ""Ranging it"" was the slang used by us grunts. You know, like you attack from a.... Eh forget it. We couldn't use missiles because there was no doubt there was a SDI installed, which meant to do anything we were going to have to get into its effective range.

And so we did. 4,427^th Company launched a ground assault from the North. Nothing out of the ordinary, couple of hundred tanks and a few GDR's. Oh, ""GDR"" is ""Giant Death Robot"" – some more of our slang. The incursion was completely ordinary, and we half expected them to be wiped out in a few minutes! But they in fact did not face much resistance.

My squad was teamed up with three others to infiltrate the city from the West, hoping the Northern Incursion would prove enough of a distraction for us to break in and disable some of their defences.

To be perfectly honest, once we were in the city walls we were scared shitless. Empty. Absolutely empty. We didn't know if they knew we were coming or what, but it made us nervous. It just wasn't right, you know? If it wasn't for the fact that we needed to stay silent, I reckon, heck, I know most of us would have been swearing. As I said, scared shitless. Our fears were almost confirmed when a group of American soldiers walked out of a building. We were dumb enough to be in the middle of the street. ""CONTACT!"" someone yelled and we all ran for cover while laying down covering fire. We had 60 men, they probably had 40, both sides had losses instantly as the street was filled with laser fire.

I dove behind a blockade just as a bolt singed my helmet. *Too close*, I thought. I looked beside me to see two more of our soldiers. One of them suggested we all stand up on the count of three and lay down some fire. We radioed across to the other side of the road to make sure they were ready with some grenades. We started counting. One. I positioned myself, ready to stand up. Two. Me and the soldier next to me's eyes met. I could see the fear in his eyes. Ha, sounds like something from a story book, but you try fighting in a war. Three. We all stood up, rifles blazing. The Americans were caught off-guard, thinking most of us had been killed and the rest fleeing. A few were downed instantly, while the others tried to fire back. Without taking my finger off the trigger, I looked to my right, across the road. As I had hoped, the soldiers were standing up, grandes held high and ready to throw. They did, very accurately. The end result was almost all the Americans in the group being killed, a fair number more when most of the roof they were next to collapsed. Ion grenades will do that, you know.

But I wasn't celebrating. Aside from a quick glance to see the result, I was still looking right. Our soldiers were taking cover next to an alley, and to my horror I saw four figures moving through the shadows, guns raised, towards our troops. I shouted, *NOO!!*, trying to bring my rifle in time to fire back. My fears were confirmed when the figures' guns flashed, lighting up their uniforms; their **American** uniforms. All our soldiers in front of them were razed instantly. Luckily another one of us had seen them, too, up the street, and as soon as they left the alley they were gunned down by him and myself.

I ran over to the limp bodies on the ground. There was no chance they were alive – they were all direct hits, but I had hope all the same. False hope. And the costs of the war hit me full on.

I had been mostly insensitive to it, but I was overcome with the sudden realisation that these men laid their lives down in the false hope that there might be a winner in this war. It sounds stupid coming from a soldier, I mean, what do I know about it? But that is honestly what I thought. Perhaps it determined my actions later that day.

After regrouping we continued pushing through the city. There was no time, nor intentions largely, to mourn losses, but I paid my own silent tribute. We eventually met up with the Northern Incursion Force, and were tasked with spreading out through the city to eliminate any remaining enemy forces. My squad and one other was assigned to go East. We were go to the very outskirts of town until we were at the wall, and then to come return. Shoot to kill.

We were approaching the wall and had only found three stray soldiers thus far. We were looking forward to the idea of turning around when we came across an old looking mansion with American soldiers outside. We instantly took cover but it was too late and they had seen us. One of them ran inside, *probably sent for reinforcements* I thought, and immediately reached for my Targetor. Hmm? Oh, yeah, it’s a device that lets us target something to be taken out from afar. I targeted this building while the other soldiers fired on the Americans. A green light came on on my Targetor – target confirmed. I released the switch, and a few moments later missiles came raining from sky, coming from our new outpost in the city centre. It was perfect timing, too, as more personnel were emerging from the building.

The mansion was razed instantly, of course. I think every soldier was killed in the blast, too. My troops and I waited for any signs of movement, and after there was none for a few minutes, we moved in for a closer look. There were a handful of survivors, and we were quick to disarm and apprehend them. But there was one who caught my attention. He was out cold, but certainly alive, pretty standard in every way, except he wore a white lab coat.

I assigned a few soldiers to stay hidden with me and guard our prisoners, while the rest of the group finished the sweep. They met us on their way back after an uneventful walk. I had managed to wake the scientist up, but couldn’t get anything out of him. We then began the walk back to the city centre where the rest of our companies would probably be waiting.

You’d say that was uneventful, would you? Well, I suppose so would I. Except for one thing. During his sleep the scientist was muttering something about an end. **The** end. What do you mean *To what?* – to this! To this war! An end to the war... Huh, unlikely if you ask me. But I had hope, all the same."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Ok, I think I have a plan.

* Switch to fundamentalism, as others have mentioned.

* Be prepared to sacrifice your outer cities to the nuke gods, build an army that could take on god in a fist fight and win from the core and move everything inwards. I'd look to move your army to memphis and be prepared to lose hieraconopolis, byblos and giza. Have some shitty cheap sacrificial units and move them from byblos up the strip till the vikings run out of nukes.

* When the vikings move forward, nuke the shit out of them, then push through with your troops and engineers. You need to clear that viking army. Worst case scenario: the Americans ally against you, but the vikings have no troops at the front line.

* Send your howitzers, tanks and infantry to the vikings, send those fuckers back to valhalla. Take everything you can as far as trondheim.

* While all this is going on see if you can get some bridges built along that strip of water between America and the vikings. They won't last but might be enough to get them fighting each other.

* Push as hard as you can into viking territory, let the Americans take LLangollen , Cyre if need be.

If you want, you can try and consolidate those three cities up at the top left into your empire but I imagine they can't launch much of an attack from there.

You might lose, you might win, you should break the stalemate."

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,Surely OP will deliver... let's just wait.
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"I ctrl + f'd for 'engineer' and saw no mention of a Civ II tactic you may wish to employ. Building an engineer in a 1-population city presents you an option to erase the city from the map, improvements and all. (I hope you've been selling every improvement that you don't need in the apocalypse each turn, incidentally.) If I'm remembering correctly, the kicker here is that the engineer will have a home city of NONE, meaning you can skip the food support requirement. An uprooted, enslaved, self-supporting city to do your bidding in eternal starvation. (Please correct me if I am remembering this wrong.)

You can use this to make an SDI-free no-man's land to burn and bleed your enemy if that will serve you, or to ensure that enemy production centers go down and stay down. The rush-built engineers will probably be more useful to you than the vulnerable and polluted cities, and they can join your own cities and pump them up to size 8. This may be enough to make viable cities on the coast with rush-built Harbors, or to contribute to production in the towns with hills or Whales if they starve slowly enough. Ideally, relocate them to sanctuary cities safe behind your lines. Not much worth a damn on the screenshots of your planet except the whales and hills anyway.

So that's the slaver option. On to genocide! Your Commie-produced Veteran spies can do some incredible damage poisoning water supplies and dropping off nukes. Each nuke halves the population, and I don't see any cities larger than Size 12. And those people won't be coming back in your world. Dead is dead. Nobody is running a food surplus. Fifteen million seven hundred thousand can go quicker than you'd think.

So at least you have a way to kill Chicago and that little American island east of Tintagel on the cheap, potentially in one turn or two. You can daisy-chain Transports by trans-shipping units using the Sleep command if memory serves, or by moving the units from ship to ship in mid-ocean regardless. And Spies are amphibious, so if there's not a ship parked on every ocean tile abutting a city you can get in and do your damage without any chance for a response. Aaaand spies ignore Zones of Control, so you can use them to get your occupier units onshore. Then just back your transport off one space and hope your nukes get through. The spies die or teleport home, your transport and occupying unit probably get shot to hell the next turn unless you get lucky with parking a Bomber on them, but you've killed a hundred thousand survivors who ain't coming back. It won't win you the war, but there's not much that can stop you from doing all this damage. If you can't control the game, control the board. The military stalemate will be much more malleable when there are ten Celts to every living American and Viking.

**tl;dr You're *already* complicit in genocide, kidnap small cities wholesale and have your Veteran Spies rise out of the ocean to murder the wretched surviving civilians like a Lovecraftian elder god.**"

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,TIL Reddit is filled with writers.
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Hate to be negative because I loved your story, but what pulled me out of the fiction was imagining what would be left of books that were 2000 years old, or trying to imagine how a computer would still work. 

Even with climate control, solar power, nuclear power, etc, various things would make the building decay.  Rats eating wires, dust from centuries of nuclear battles clogging intake and exhaust fans.  Erosion from rain, unchecked plant growth, etc.

Without caretakers of some sort the place would certainly fail.  Maybe the caretakers were robots who knows, but the fact that soldiers can casually pick up 2000 year old fiction books and read them just seems out of place."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"The story goes from past to present tense....I'll stick with past

Usually the experience of awaking with a pounding, throbbing pain in your temples and a sore body was testament to an evening to substance abuse.  I was not used such experiences, with the rationing being rather severe the last decade.  Alcohol was nearly impossible to find, and even the ratty home made versions of it were rare.  Groggily I sat up, the darkness illuminated by burning embers and neighboring houses set alight and battered by the enemies missile barrage.  Small arms fire peppered in the distance, giving a macabre closing hymn for this funeral pyre I was situated in.  My men were eviscerated, severed limbs were settled around me like leaves falling from trees with the changing of the seasons.  Not that I had ever witnessed that phenomena firsthand, but when I was younger the tales of lush green forests enthralled me.  Once I viewed a grove of pines, with green needles.  That valley is gone now, I thought morosely, destroyed in last years nuclear strike.  Just radiation and despair now.  

There was a faint moaning sound to my left under rubble from the mansion.  I knew I would not want to see what was left of the soldier under there, but I stood and staggered over to him.  Sometimes holding a dying ones hand or comforting them in their last moments made the transition easier.  Usually we just put a bullet in their heads, but with potential enemy troops nearby I opted out of that decision.  

I removed the pieces of brick, mortar, and wood to find one of the ammunition carriers from my machine gun section.  ""Help me, for God's sake, help,"" he croaked, barely audible.  I could not find any trace of his legs below the knees.  They were ragged stumps, with bits of bone poking out the ends.  The charring from had moderately cauterized the viscous wound, staunching the blood loss that would have been quickly fatal otherwise.  The boys midsection had been ripped open, and his innards were on his lap and pooling over the side of his torso.  I could see the intestines glistening because of nearby fires.  ""Help me....I want to go home....it hurts so much,""  tears ran down his sooty face, little clean rivulets on an expiring surface.  I knew he was done for, there was not one doubt about it.  

Then I heard it.  Vehicle engines.  They were coming down the street.  I ducked down beside the boy, and put my hand over his mouth to cover up any sort of noise he could produce.  The tires stopped and I heard soldiers dismount.  Beads of sweat dripped down my face, and I could feel my body become tense.  Were they friend or foe?

The injured child was squirming now, and the groans were becoming incessantly louder.  ""Shut up,"" I whispered coldly.  ""Just shut up or we're both dead.""  I saw the silhouettes of the men as they fanned out and could tell by the formation pattern that they were not friendly.  They rifled through the rucksacks of my dead soldiers, taking rations and clothing.  There would be nothing else of value in them.  I watched one of the enemy take a small book from the pack of my dead medic presumably, as he had been the only openly religious man in the section.  A lot of good that did him, I said in my head.  

The boy flailed his arms, foolishly believing that the men who walked among us as we lay in rubble would provide aid.  His rapid movements knocked over a chunk of concrete or stone, in the darkness I was unsure.  Regardless it fell to the ground and bounced off a wooden beam with an audible noise.  I could see some of the soldiers tense up and some hit the ground instantly, trying to get to cover.  Some of them stood and did not move at all.  I knew they were definitely new replacements, fresh meat for the unending slaughter.  

One walked over to us, sauntering slowly, systematically pausing along the way.  He was mere meters away.  I wanted to run, to bolt away and scream.  I let out a string of expletives mentally and felt my bladder relax without my permission.  The urine soaked my trousers.  My hand was still tightly gripped over the injured boys mouth, but the soldier was so close he would hear the muffled breathing anyways.  With caution I removed my trench knife from my sheath and had it at the ready.  Any second this soldier would see that we were not debris.  His rifle had a nasty looking bayonet on the edge, shining bright from the fires.  ""Steady boy, steady,"" I whispered.  He did not comply and cried softly.  I knew I was done for.  The man had heard and was fast approaching, so I lay my head down on the scorched earth and feigned dead.  

""Please, please....""  the injured boy said to the enemy.  I heard the bayonet stick into the boys body with a sickly noise.  He screamed, the death rattle piercing the night, and shook violently.  I used his death to my advantage and utilizing my free arm to keep my opponents rifle from rising I leaned up and quickly thrust my knife deep into his bowels.  He shrieked as well and I felt warm blood coat my hand as he went limp and collapsed to the ground in horrific pain.  

This situation had become worse with each second.  The rifle was stuck  because of the bayonet in my dying ammunition carrier, who was still screaming and flailing listlessly.  He was dead but he did not know it.  I pulled it out hastily and checked to see if the safety was off.  Voices were yelling at each other in the darkness.  I fired towards silhouettes and shadows, and made sure to put a round in my soldiers head to spare his suffering.  I left the enemy I had stabbed writhing and groaning.  As I sprinted away I could heard the hiss and snap of bullets as they narrowly missed me.  The terror was unimaginable.  I was manic, completely on auto pilot but horrified all the same.  I wanted to crawl into my mind and stay there.  I wanted this to end.  I wanted to be in another body.  It was like i was in a dream, just a long dark dream that was not meant to be.  Poor eyesight and darkness combined are a ghastly duo and soon enough I tripped and fell, rolling down a slight hill before coming to a stop.  Every bone in my body was sore, and I thought about the eyes of my young ammunition carrier.  Larga something or other.  First name unknown.  Sixteen.  Dead, for the nation and the people.  Disgusting.  His eyes were looking to me for safety, for aid.  I effectively killed him.  If his parents were living, I imagine how they would take the news.  Yes commissar, we understand our son died valiantly and gloriously on the field of battle.  It was a quick death and he was a hero, and all of that compiled bull shit.  I felt dry in the throat, and vomited bile on myself as I sat in relative silence.  How long had I been running?  Thirty seconds, or thirty minutes, I would have not known the difference.  My weapon was out of ammunition.  But the bayonet was still on it, with a sixteen year olds blood of course.  I stood and walked into the dark, the rumble of artillery in the distance a supple reminder of the utter hell I lived in.

uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"Ah, but there are ways.

I'm pretty sure this tactic will work in Civ2, but it's been a very long time since I played that. I know it will work in FreeCiv, as that's where a friend and I perfected it. The scenario we were dealing with was late-game where everyone had almost all of the tech, and we were attempting to take a dense-packed enemy continent: over 100 cities, massively rail integration between all of them. We landed, took one city, and that immediately sparked a massive swarm of howitzers boiling out of every other city on the continent to retake it. Repeat this a few times, same deal.

Finally, we realized a few things. 1) Bombers can take off on one turn and return to base on the next. 2) Ground units can't enter squares occupied by enemy aircraft.

Realizing this, our path became clear. We proceeded to park a couple of carriers off shore, then used our bombers to screen off one or two enemy cities from the rest of the continent, switching them out every turn to maintain the line. We then pounded those cities into rubble and took them to establish a bridgehead and base for our bombers, moved in more units, and slowly extended the line across the entire north-south axis of the continent as we took more cities. I think when we were midway through the process, we had around 70 active bombers and a screening wall 30 squares long.

I think you could use this same tactic in Civ2, perhaps with a bit more buffer space between your bomber screen and the cities you take to avoid having nuclear strikes on newly-captured cities take out the line. The one thing we didn't have to deal with there was enemy nukes -- they didn't have any.

Man, I miss Civ."
uxpil,2012-06-12,2012-06-12,"True. I also recall that railroads give you infinite movement in Civ2, so paratroopers aren't really needed, any unit would do. But I guess you'd really need to take out basically the entire empire in one turn to prevent a counterattack."

Station high-defense stack of doom on the ashes of the cities and send in some engineers to build fortresses to further support. If you can divert enough of their resources to trying to re-claim this region via Settlers, you might be able to hit their weaker cities (raze those too). 

No guarantees this will work -- it relies entirely on metagaming the AI into making a foolish choice during Scorched Earth, but it might disrupt the stalemate.

""May 25th, 1952. Ambrosius Baumgartner, Captain of the German Ironclad ""Krupp""

Today an Indian fighter squadron attacked our trusty Krupp while we were fulfilling our this year's mission to defend the Gulf of Munich. High command set us back here in the deep north to keep our outdated ship out of harm's way, but war is cruel and it found us today.

The ship has fought many a great battle, but against a modern fighter squadron, she shouldn't stand a chance. She is no modern cruiser, after all. The first two striving runs nearly took us out and many good men lost their lives.

All seemed lost, when Kanonier Velmer had an idea. When they returned for the third time, he fired all cannons at once, without any balls loaded even, just as they were going into their descent on us. The heavy, oily smoke that arose from the mounds of our ancient weaponry must have blocked their sight by pure luck for us. And what luck it was, as the strife not only missed us completely, but the whole squadron was not able to pull up in time anymore.

When I heard all cannons firing, I thought we were lost. But upon seeing the aftermath, I was dumbfounded. We thanked our god and our king, when it was clear that we were victorious in the most uneven battle since the Stand of the Pikemen hundred years ago. As long as I live, I will never forget this day when brave Kanonier Velmer saved all our souls with his ingenuity."""

- We used two and the war stopped

Contrasting this with being at war for almost two thousand years with constant nuclear exchange, nuclear terrorism, and general conflict. Without some kind of external threat for everyone to focus on to the exclusion of killing each other, there is no way for the sides to stop the war. Even a slow manipulation of the public mindset would take generations to make work.

I personally did not like Civ 3 at all and kept up with AC instead. Civ4 BTS is good, though it's missing *so many* awesome features from AC. Civ5 finally puts back a few of those AC-features, but it strips away tons of other stuff and is *absurdly* laggy.

Plus AC has a cool story, and you get to feel conflicted over the fact that you're building a shithole dystopian future without a single fuck given to your citizens.

The game shows its age, but it's still very fun."

>""The Admiralty had initially been reluctant to use large ocean liners as troop transports because of their vulnerability to enemy attack, however a shortage of ships gave them little choice. At the same time, Olympic's other sister ship Britannic, which had not yet been completed, was requisitioned as a hospital ship. In that role she would strike a mine and sink the following year.

>""[...]

>""In the early hours of 12 May 1918, while en route for France with US troops under the command of Captain Hayes, Olympic sighted a surfaced U-boat 500 m (1,600 ft) ahead.[58] Her gunners opened fire at once, and she turned to ram the submarine, which immediately crash dived to 30 m (98 ft) and turned to a parallel course. Almost immediately afterwards Olympic struck the submarine just aft of her conning tower and her port propeller sliced through U-103's pressure hull. The crew of U-103 blew her ballast tanks, scuttled and abandoned the submarine. **This is the only known incident in World War I in which a merchant vessel sank an enemy warship.** Olympic returned to Southampton with at least two hull plates dented and her prow twisted to one side, but not breached.""

None of them really compare with AC, just in terms of mechanics.  And I agree that story-wise, AC was magnificent.  Hell, ten years on and I still quote Pravin Lal or Chairman Yang every now and again.  ""Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master.""

It's very hard to do dystopian SF without being corny, especially with an unpredictable narrative, but by and large I think AC is a gem of the genre.  For example, the fact that most tech descriptions were done as philosophical arguments by faction leaders was a truly elegant way of allowing the world to express itself without binding the narrative into a distinct sequence of events."

It's a cozy farming simulator where you tend to you farm, grow crops, tend to animals, meet neighbors, participate in community events, There's a lot to do. In Co-op situations I usually see the 'experienced' gamer taking on the objective based tasks, while the 'little brother' player usually finds a task that's engaging to them and gets focused on that. The more intense sections like the mines and dungeons, which have light combat mechanics, could use someone with a bit more experience to fend off enemies while they crack away at boulders. 

There's also a lot of customization. The colors of your houses, farm buildings, interior furniture, the layout of the farm, exterior decorations. Maybe that aspect appeals to them, so while you're out doing the more intense areas, she's back at the farm checking off which animals she's milked today, or creating paved paths so your travels around the farm are faster. She goes fishing at the pier for the day, you visit the blacksmith with Geodes to crack open. You explore the forest for the day while she goes to investigate the Train rolling through town. There's plenty to work toward, and the game is just so cozy and pleasant that it's hard to to find it endearing. I think there's enough there that one or more activities will interest her."

It's on almost every modern-day system (Phones, Consoles, Computer), it's 2d so you don't have to worry about the motion sickness that comes with 3d games for a lot of starters, and it has an engaging and funny story. The only draw back is that it might be a bit too light on gameplay mechanics to properly teach common gameplay systems, to the extent some people consider Ace Attourney a visual novel, and not a game. It's a point and click so you would constantly be manipulating the mouse/analogue stick and using buttons to manipulate the menus, and that can teach familiarity with the controller, but there is nothing that requires urgent button presses which is important important to most games.

Terraria is similarly on a ton of devices and is 2d. It has split screen and online co-op. There is a ton of player customization and opportunity for creative expression. The combat is simplistic but you will acquire weapons and armour with cool effects to keep things interesting. It will require one of you to use a wiki to learn how to progress though, the game doesn't have a strong guiding hand, it is also a survival game but the standard difficulty let's you keep your items when you die, except for money."

Firstly, see what the person is interested in outside of gaming: are they into music? Movies? What’s their favorite genre? Do they have a hobby they’re really invested in? Do they like good stories? Is there a certain fantasy they like to be immersed in? Like go on an adventure, live a cozy simple life, become a wizard or even a villain of some sort?









See what type of aesthetic do they enjoy, recommend fantasy titles if they like fantasy obviously. If they’re a fan of certain movies then recommend the movie’s game to them if it’s good of course. For example if they like Star Wars a recent recommendation is Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order.







If they like a certain level of freedom and exploration while simultaneously living in an epic fantasy then Elder Scrolls games is what I recommend, usually would recommend Skyrim but both Oblivion and Morrowind are good too.











If they like puzzle games and are also interested in good stories then the Professor Layton series is my go to recommendation.









Basically, try to see what they would enjoy outside of holding a controller, or a mouse and keyboard, and just pressing buttons. Gaming is immersive by nature, and they would immerse themselves further if their gaming experience aligns with their interests and hobbies outside of gaming. I guarantee there’s a game out there for every interest under the sun, so finding a title anyone, even a none gamer, would enjoy should not be difficult."

I threw in some Mario Odyssey, Luigi's Mansion 3, and other simple couch co-op games. Now she's exploring the PS+ page and finding games for herself. She just finished What Remains of Edith Finch."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Stardew valley and overcooked are both simple and amazing.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I only started playing video games as an adult, and started with Mass Effect. I think this game is perfect, since the easy modes and aim assist help A LOT with getting a player used to mechanics, inventory, moving around, and the extra help keeps the player's frustration down. When I tried picking up other games they were too complicated in the beginning with move combos or inventory management or combat difficulty, and Mass Effect keeps things pretty simple and let's people play a pretty basic version of the game but still get all the good story lines and such. And the introduction of your choices having a lasting effect on how the story goes throughout the trilogy is pretty fun too."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I feel something to help beginners is seeing their work progress. I say i sandbox like stardew or Minecraft since they could build a home and have stuff that is theirs
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,my wife has just gotten into games. luigi’s mansion  and mario have been a great intro with decent learning curve
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,My wife's path from non-gamer to semi-gamer was Stardew Valley -> It Takes Two -> Hogwarts Legacy.  It Takes Two was a great gaming experience if you are looking for Co-op.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"What are her interests?

Does she like fantasy?  Puzzles?

If she has no interest in fantasy and elves and shit, that excludes a lot of games.  

Puzzles?  Maybe she would like talos principle.

I'd honestly start with games that break through into mainstream.  Among us, fall guys, keep talking and nobody explodes.  

The games are more about having fun than winning.  Being bad at them can be fun."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My fiancée wasn’t really a gamer when we met but she broke her ankle a few summers ago and I set her up with the uncharted series (I skipped the first one, just showed her a YouTube wrap up of the story) and she chewed through 2-5 pretty quickly.  It’s great voice acting and graphics, and fairly simple to do satisfying stuff.  We are now playing hell divers 2 together which is amazing!  The best one we’ve played together is it takes two.  The toughest part I found was the initial learning or controlling the camera in these third person games.  Oh and she loved hades and beat that too, but she’s a big Greek mythology nerd so I think that was the catalyst"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Spyro the dragon. You can get all the remastered versions on PS5. I think it is the ultimate noob friendly game. And you can help her with the harder parts

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Sims 3 is the only answer.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It Takes Two! Great game to play in a couch multiplayer since you actually have to rely on each other to beat it. Plus, the story is not bad either.

Edit: If she’s into village management, get Dragon Quest: Builders, it’s basically Minecraft with a storyline and pretty neat characters."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice definitely, most beginner friendly game ever. Easy bosses and enemies, true video game with amazing gameplay."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"surprised i didn’t see anyone mention stardew valley. it would be a good starter game, and she can play it at her own pace. sims 4 base game is free so that might be a good option too, and she could develop her own unique play style."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"If you have ps Catalog, I love Detroit Become Human.  Great story, very little actual gameplay elements but the ones you do have feel very impactful.  Great for someone's first game.  Feels like a Movie you play."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Gone Home

It's a first person exploration game which she can play at her own pace and learn controlling movement and camera in a 3D environment."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Just as important as the game itself is your approach to playing with her. Try not to mentally approach it as ""playing games with my girlfriend"", but rather ""helping my girlfriend enjoy playing this game"". This approach is also important in playing games with children. 

That simple reframe is more powerful than it looks as-written. The approach takes the pressure off of the person you're playing with, and makes it less likely that you'll get frustrated and impatient with them struggling with concepts that are ingrained in you and feel simple to your mind."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Probably something that have some similarity to other kind of entertainment. Triple A linear games, such as Uncharted or The Last Of Us can be a good introduction to gaming since it can be seen as playable movies."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Animal Crossing new horizons, perfect and peaceful game that clicks with almost anyone."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"2D mario games are super beginner friendly and these days they are very forgiving, especially on coop. I would also recomment It Takes Two, it includes a ton of different videogame mechanics and physics; platforming, boat driving, plane driving, rythm games, puzzles, 3rd person shooting and much much more. Also you cant die so its super forgiving."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"The Borderlands franchise as a whole. Great humor,Incredible story and imo a lot of replayability"

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Absolutely stardew valley

This would be more advanced, but I think a good beginner 3d platformer would be A Hat in Time"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Ori and the blind forest. 

Great introductory puzzles, combat is incredibly simple, and the first 10 minutes of the game will hook you in and pull on the heartstrings of even the most stone-hearted person."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,It Takes Two is fantastic.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"A fighting game.

She can start just mashing buttons doing random things. Anyone can have fun doing that. Then introduce concepts like turns and blocking during your opponents' turn, then normals and spacing, then how to cancel vs link attacks together, then how to implement frametraps, then look at Oki and throw escapes, then if the game has it, look into weight classes and sidestep game, then just frames, counter hits, fuzzy guard and anything else specific to that game. Before you know it, she's killing it and addicted to improving."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,It takes two. Great game for couples and you only need one person to download it. It's also a great couch co-op game
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Maybe It Takes Two?
You can play together and it covers a wide variety of mini games and mechanics that are all easy to learn. That might help her figure out what types of games she enjoys more."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"the last of us. 

or just any other single player story game with straightforward gameplay mechanics. everyone watches movies so she will love the game simply because of the storytelling. at the same time it will be her first game and she will discover what gaming is while not being overwhelmed with the difficulty or controls."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Spiderman remastered! I played it after years of not gaming and it was so easy to play. Or Roblox because it offers so many game modes and lacking skill usually correlates to a funnier gaming experience.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"GTA was how I got my roommate into gaming. But if you're looking for something you can play together I recommend It Takes Two, it shouldn't be too difficult that you have to carry her through the game and it's a fun game. 

Minecraft is goat for getting my friends into gaming"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Minecraft :)
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,My GF isn’t much of a gamer but she was more than happy to play Portals 2 and the Zombies mode on Call of Duty with me 😮
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Minecraft it can be as in depth or easy as you need to be.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Mass Effect or Dragon age, the story is amazing and the characters are top tier. Plus the romance options are epic (Garrus, Cullen, Iron Bull)."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"I found portal 2 to be good for this. 

You aren't under time pressure most of the time and there are no real enemies so it's a good environment for just getting used to FPS type controls. You can retry and fail as many times as needed and just laugh it off together."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,Helldivers. Keep it on easy or medium and have fun. My gf and I enjoy it so much. And fortnight. Tycoons are super fun and simple.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Stardew valley, Minecraft and stuff are good for new gamers imo I would just recommend a chill game so they can get familiar with using controller before you maybe try faster paced stuff such as Doom or CoD and stuff."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"My wife didn't start as a gamer, but she liked these:
Final fantasy X, portal 2, Spiderman ps4, prince of Persia and persona 5. Also things like it takes 2 are good so you can play together."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Stardew valley or Minecraft.

Both are super easy to learn but have tons of depth."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Stardew valley!

Super cozy, fun game play and lots to do"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,I agree with all the people who said super mario bros (whichever version you want) but I also think that undertale is a good move (obviously if the person does not want a bunch of information on his face like shooters) I know that you have to keep watching your life and that stuff but its not that heavy nor does penalize you badly for dying and as a plus it has a fking great story and narrative fk I wish I could play undertale for the first time again
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Overcooked, It takes two, A Way Out(sad ending btw), Little Big Planet 1 - 3, and Limbo.

These are all on PlayStation. 

I recommend playing A Way Out first then It takes two, that way you'll understand the easter egg. You can only play the two games together btw it's not single player."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Gauntlet Slayer Edition.

Coop. Adjustable difficulty. Controls are pretty simple. Lots of action to keep her engaged. Plenty of options for you to keep things interesting (Wizard is complex and fun.) You can pause the game. Aside from boss fights and Reaper levels, the gameplay has regular opportunities to break for a bit and check in with her.

The hardest part will be the levels where the Reaper hunts you, since it forces you to keep moving. Teach her that she can easily kite the Reaper in the open.

Start on easy difficulty. Be kind and encouraging to her while she plays, even if you're dying a lot.

It's sadly not the longest game, but as you both get better you can play again on higher difficulty and with different classes."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Honestly, probably Call of Duty that series has been crafted to lure casuals and first-timers in. Which one you pick is up to you, but the simplicity and ease that beginners can pick it and get engaged is incredible. There is a resson it has sold so well and been around so long. They can play the campaign and then co-op the zombies and get really hooked."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Apparently it's The Sims. I have been trying for a very long time to find a game for my wife to play that she will actually enjoy. I would have to straight up force her to at least give random games a try because she will never actually try anything on her own initiative. That is until The Sims 4, we downloaded it to our PS5 and she has been playing it every day for like a month."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Biped, It takes two, overcooked. Mario Party/kart

These games for my sister into gaming again.

Albeit, she never really was into gaming."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Not sure if you're still taking suggestions but the absolute best game to introduce new gamers to is Tetris. I have no idea why I didn't see at the top of the list but you could hand that game to your grandma and she'd get it. 

For something a little faster and more advanced I've had a lot of success with 2 different non-gaming partners (one my now wife) by starting with twin stick shooters. I don't know why but it seems easier for them to wrap their head around analog sticks when the camera is fixed. 

PS4 housemarquee games are great here  Resogun and Dead Nation both worked really well. Lara Croft's Temple of Osiris was fun too but it doesn't work that well on PS5. Lovers in a dangerous Spacetime is also really good. 

Lastly, for a non-twinstick game I would say Overcooked if you want to stress test this relationship"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Couch co-op! Not only will there be a literal guide, it can be in-person fun which hits different than gaming over the ‘net.

As for the game, maybe Portal?"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,Firewatch. A simple walking simulator with an interesting story and pleasant visual design
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,Something like stardew  valley that can be as dangerous as they want it to be
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,Wildcard answer here.  VR. Something basic. The ps4 vr sample pack? It's fun enough fir anyone that they'll keep playing around with it enough to get the hang of basic controls.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Sackboy.  My wife loves it because of it's simple controls, creative levels, enough of a challenge to feel accomplished, searching for items, and we can play together or she can play alone.  Highly recommend Sackboy."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Something with relatively low barrier of entry and low execution/control demands (so no devil may cry, or dark souls)

I would say sims, Minecraft, Stardew valley etc"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Dark Souls!

Kidding.

I’d say maybe something like Fallout: New Vegas; Excellent story, world, and characters, simple systems, not terribly complicated, and just the right amount of difficulty.

Alternatively, a game like Minecraft, Terraria, Subnautica, or Valheim."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,Get OG Duck Hunt.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Go by trailers/genres and get a feel for what they like (fast/slow pace, engaged or brain off kinda games, shooter/strategy/rpg) and then go from there  
Also simple controls and systems is key  
I really wanted my gf to play ""It takes Two"" with me but since she hasnt played ANYTHING EVER she was extremely overwhelmed with camera position + movement + action at the same time  
So we went into Partygames like Overcooked for a time, then some Stardew Valley followed by her first ""on her own - game"" which was Firewatch and now she might even try witcher 3/hogwarts legacy soon as she picks up controls/systems more easily now"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"This is not a good choice in the slightest but I got my partner to play and enjoy Monster Hunter of all things as their very first video game, all the while learning how to navigate a controller.

I still laugh a little in disbelief but it made me realize with enough patience and guidance, like explaining video game tropes, (ex. green = good/hp/healing) a lot of people can get the hang of things pretty fast."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"The Lego games are pretty decent introductions. Choose one with a franchise she's into and play it with her. Lighthearted, decently easy with very little penalty for death, simple controls (no messing with a camera), etc. Worth a shot at the very least :)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"World of warcraft man. Start leveling on your own pace, really nice people to play with and 90% of the community is helpfull!"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,The wolf among us or the telltale walking dead games. You handle the qte sections but let them learn how to do basics like walk around etc and clicking/investigating things. Pause the game when choices come up so they can take time to read them and fully think them out.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Probably gonna be lost but maybe an original Lego game for 3d, 2d for star dew valley and eventually MMOs and then the rest"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,I would start someone out on a chill open world/RPG type of game.  The perfect genre to show someone that there are entire worlds worth exploring from the comfort of your living room.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Tinykin. Very forgiving, cute, fun and simple."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"A lot of the suggestions are for very easy and or accessible games which is fine I think, but I'm going to go against the grain here and recommend a sort of ""start at the deep end"" kind of thing that's not just a meme.  


 I think an experience that could really sell the idea of gaming and the appeal of games in the fullest package while also being an excellent learning tool that's not too disorienting or overwhelming while teaching and showing off an incredibly wide array of mechanics, terminology and gaming concepts would be an ideal start and to thst end I recommend a Metroidvania. 


They are 2D yet they greatly reward exploration and promote map navigation. They have a relatively simple control scheme but a fair challenge to combat and a good balance of combat, platforming and puzzles. They tend to have notable boss encounters. They can have light RPG and progression mechanics and equipment management and item use. And they have relatively simple stories that aren't too difficult to follow. 


Plus there is a huge variety of them in terms of flavor, aesthetic, mechanics emphasized and difficulty that it should be easy to find a perfect fit for a first gaming experience. For more concrete recommendations there's stuff like Hollow Knight, Momodora 3, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, the og Symphony of the Night, Yohane the Parhelion: Blaze in the Deep blue (this one is especially good for beginners imo), RibiRabi and many more. "
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I went though this same thing with my wife - what you want is either a 2D/sidescroller game or one where the camera(aiming with a second stick) is a non issue. 

On ps5:

2D she plays the binding of Isaac, and Klonoa which is more of a 3D side scroller. 

For actually 3D she played Spyro and loved it - simple platformer, cute, and the camera has a nice auto/active mode so she didn't need tob worry about looking around too much. Also Sackboy Adventure"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My fiancée's path was a bit weird. She was similarly a non gamer.

I introduced her to Sims 4 and she had fun with that. Then we played Monster Hunter World together, and that's the first game she 1000 hour'd. She also had a lot of fun with Hades and Dead Cells. 

Other bigger games include Horizon Zero Dawn (and the recent pc release of forbidden west) and Assassin's Creed Odyssey. 

I actually heavily recommend against It Takes Two. Especially with two different skill levels, it made my fiancée very frustrated and she absolutely hated the game by the end.

Edit: for coop, it's mostly gonna be Monster Hunter World from this list."

Both are very simple games to play, basic controls, highly engaging gameplay and great ambience. Highly recommended, although for any first-timer, always sit with them for the initial play session and provide encouragement and tips. Even simple games are no different."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"If they’ve never played a game, they need to understand using the controller more than anything.

A basic 2D platformer like Mario is a good start. Then, getting them used to dual analog controls is smart. Geometry Wars is a good, basic option. Then, try a full 3D game, but not one requiring quick action. The Walking Dead games, Wolf Among Us, or Life is Strange are all low intensity work.

2, Please for the love of god don't think that beginners will enjoy classic masterpieces immedietly. Sure, they were good games, maybe even better compared to their counterparts in their own time, than the current version is, but giving TES: Oblivion to a beginner would do more harm, than good.

3, Something fun, but challenging. The 2nd part is the harder in my opinion as ""challenging"" is defined by the person playing and not by the game itself.

Some games that could fit these criteria in my opinion are:
- It takes two
- Battleblock theater
- Castle crashers"

We’ve played simple things like Mario Kart and Mario Party, but she’s also waist deep in Baldurs Gate 3 with me. For her, complex controls are an issue, as well as pacing of action. She likes BG3 because all the fights are turn based, but she likes Kart because it’s “fast paced and there’s action.”  I think the best approach is to find a game near something they already like."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"This always sounds odd to people who've grown up with games all their life, but gaming controls (whether KB+M or controller) are not going to be intuitive for a non-gamer. Even if they use a computer in their day to day life.

I would say, first, start with a side scroller of some kind. Something 2D/2.5D/top down where they don't need to control the camera on top of everything else.

Keep it simple, but pick something high quality/acclaimed that will get their attention. Also something that isn't too hard.

Also, veer away from titles that are too old. It can be tempting to start ""at the beginning"", but accessibility has come along a lot in recent years. They can go back if they need to.

Stardew Valley is a popular choice for people just starting out. It has simple controls, low difficulty and is generally very fun to play."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Minecraft with a cute shader and I'm speaking from experience. Not the only example but my current gf was one of those that was not fond of video games because her (now adult) son was a fanatic. She turned into the typical 40yo ""games are bad"" mother. I'm a lifelong hardcore. It starts with her watching my gameplay. She liked RE:7 so much, she wanted to watch me playthrough 8. I use this mild interest and start playing Minecraft, understanding its cuteness and simplicity gives it an extremely low bar for entry.

Fast forward 4 years, she just beat Horizon: FW on her own gaming laptop yesterday. I don't even really like adventure style. You need to find something that will passively perk their interest first, then find something with a low learning curve for introduction.

Other examples: God of War -> Lego Batman
Thrill Kill -> Micro Machines"

I started with AoE II, Roller Coaster Tycoon, and Lego Racers so maybe modern iterations of the genre. Older Need for Speed games can be really fun along with the first City Skylines and Planet Coaster.

The Lego games are also really simple but can be a blast. There's multiple different IP's so she could pick one she likes. It also has coop which is a plus. Last suggestion is Sims 2 as I haven't played the newer ones."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"For starters stay FAR away from almost anything Simulator. Stuff like Minecraft where the ""end goal"" is user created is a terrible way to be introduced to what games offer.

Platformers are tried and true introductions. Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart is on PC and PS5 and is really good. Also there's A Hat in Time which is on PC and really good.

Something like Stardew Valley, while a ""simulator"", has defined goals but open ended enough to not feel trapped. (PC) (Co-Op)

Costume Quest is a cute, turn-based combat game about halloween costumes giving superpowers to stop evil. (PC)

Damn near ANY of the Lego games are a good choice. (Lots on PC)

If they like the show the South Park games are really good and faithful. More X-Com style turn-based. (PC)

Strange Brigade is a third-person Co-Op shooter themed like a ye'old saturday morning adventure shoiw. (PC)

The Yakuza games are absolute fun insanity in terms of story and are really nice beat-em-up fighter games. (All on PC)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"In my experience camera is a BIG struggle so First Person games are usually a big nono, even Third Person Shooters can be hard so go with cover based one in case (so the player can hide behind something and only mind about aiming, the player will practice aim and looking around in different situation which feels less stressful). I, for example, found Uncharted to be succesful as a first game for people that are ""willing to learn"" for the reason written up here + story, for others who don't want to get stressed out while playing I suggest more chill games without the need to control the camera (sidescrollers, top view or whatever), those are usually the best choice."

Has layers if you're willing to pursue it(runeys for example, at least in RFF, not sure about 5). They are only Nintendo though afaik. 

Also Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley for purely farming/relationship games, even Disney's Dreamlight Valley.

The early Final Fantasy games (1-6) can be a great starting point too, and get you into the habit of powering up by using new equipment. 13 was good too, but the levelling system is a bit bamboozling and 15 is even worse from memory.

My wife also enjoyed Darksiders 1, God Of War, Bayonetta and those kind of hack and slash, button mash(with combos if you want to Min-Max) style games. As it was early in her gaming life, she wasn't as keen on Darksiders 2 as it had more of an RPG feel with equipment and loot.

Skyrim is also a good game where it doesnt matter what you do. Spend the day catching butterflies and riding horses if you want.

My boyfriend and I were playing Dysmantle for a while, that could be a good choice if she eventually wants to move into a game with combat after playing something like stardew Valley. It's got an interesting storyline, is co-op so you can carry her if need be, and also focuses on building and resource gathering. Once she's comfy with that, maybe a first or third person pov game like portal or firewatch to familiarize her with modern dual stick controls. I got my friend comfy with dual sticks with portal."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Honestly I don’t have many “beginner” games on PC. I mostly grew up with GBA/DS games, and honestly those can be a good starting point. 


Stardew Valley is a good game to try. Pretty laid back farming/life sim. Massive appeal and draws in a wide audience. Strong single player gameplay and offers late game challenges as players become more skilled/knowledgeable.

Animal Crossing (Switch Exclusive) is like Stardew in many ways. Many gameplay elements are easier/simplified in favor of making it a game quite literally anyone can play, even people new to gaming.  Either way, both this and stardew are super wholesome communities, and the most you’ll see in terms of “drama” is gossip about npc villagers.



Deep Rock Galactic would be a decent beginner game too, at least for an FPS. It’s PvE co-op, but you can turn the difficulty down, and you can easy hard carry them on hazard 1 as they learn. If they need to play solo, they’ll have a small drone call bosco to help them. Community is also super wholesome and nice too."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My partner who isn't a Gamer really enjoyed baldurs gate 3. We played it through together with one character because she felt that coop would be too much.

It's great because you can put it on very easy and it isn't that much about skill, it's a lot about luck and how good your dice throws are.

It's also story-heavy and mechanics-light so it is probably easy to pickup especially if she likes fantasy"

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It really depends on what they’re interested in. For me, the way I got into gaming was the PlayStation 2 game “Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis.” I liked dinosaurs, and I liked building things.

Playing that game led into other games that I was willing to try, first to racing games and then into action RPG’s. 

Consider what the person you’re trying to get into gaming is interested in and suggest a game from that genre, particularly if you have experience with it. Just don’t choose something that will be overwhelming for them and “full of content.” Sometimes, you’ve just gotta start small."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"See below a list of games that have gone over well with my non-gamer g/f. 

Please note, some of these games are single player puzzlers. It is something worth considering as many puzzle games can be fun to play through together, swapping the pad or just having your better halfs input on solutions whilst you control the character. We often play these sort of games with a drink in hand on dreary nights in winter and it can make a nice change from tv/films.

+ It takes two 
+ Return of Obra Dihn
+ Mario kart
+ Baba is you
+ Spirit Fairer
+ Trine series (not 3, it sucks)
+ Resident Evil revelations 2
+ Portal 2
+ Ibb & Obb
+ What remains of Edith Finch

I have also recently managed to get her into Baldurs Gate 3 but would not recommend this for you right now. It is a complex game with awkward controls and mechanics that need to be explained as you go along. I think a new player might find this overwhelming but worth noting as the coop experience is fantastic. It is working out so far for us, she has been enjoying role playing (mainly talking to animals) and managed to get a handle on the combat. I take care of the ""admin"" after play sessions (equipment, selling loot etc) to streamline the experience for her."

My biggest recommendation would be to have a switch or two though, nintendo games are generally more beginner friendly (animal crossing, pokemon, mario, etc.)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Firewatch is a pretty good one if they are new to 3D games, especially first person ones. Super Mario is the obvious 2D choice."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My wife started with puzzle games like she had on her phone, then moved on to couch coop shooters. Once she got comfortable playing in first  person she started playing rpgs."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game with amazing OST and gameplay. Highly recommended
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My suggestion would be something turn-based, or slow and with indirect controls.

Like 'Craft the World', where you click on rocks to mine them, click on trees to chop them, and your dwarfs will go and do it on their own. Without you needing to take direct control of them and do it manually (which you can also do in that game if you want).

Basically a lot of gamers have ""gamer brain"", and muscle memory for controls (mouse + keyboard combo, WASD, etc), but non-gamers don't. So you can't give a non-gamer a game that requires a gamer brain, and expect them to know the tropes and established norms that they know nothing about.

So Stardew Valley, as people suggest, wouldn't be my first choice. It's too complex, direct control, limited for time/stamina per day, and it doesn't tell you a lot of stuff (like which NPC likes what, at least it didn't last time I played). So that one is too complex and problematic for a complete novice.

So I'd go for something self-driving and non-combat that basically lacks a ""Game Over"" screeen at all, because it's just not possible. Something like The Sims, where you start with a premade house, and your sim takes care of itself 90% of the time. And once she's comfy with gaming concepts and has a bit of gamer brain, then you can move on to other stuff. If she's OK with shooting, XCom series on easiest difficulty is pretty good. Again, turn-based, largely self-driving at first. Then get started on direct control."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Any of the Lego games. Teaches you simple platforming, puzzle solving and exploring. 

Story FPS games on EASY like Halo, or maybe Call of Duty. Teaches you how to aim and shoot and walk around in FPS and there is little to keep track of. Even easier, Power Wash Simulator, because you can’t die. 

This may sound dumb, but once she gets the basics, if you have an Elden Ring or Souls game file on the first play through and are high level/end game, you can get her to run around and kill easy mobs. Low risk of dying, teaches fighting mechanics in an action game at a very refined level. Also gives an opportunity to experience tracking of location, healing, fighting multiple mobs etc. Enemies constantly respawn after resting and would die in 1-2 hits easy.m
 
On PS5, Astro’s Playroom."

Valheim can be really really hard but you can now set the game world rules to easy & enjoy the scenery. Seriously recommended."

The builds/combat is doable to mater what character or class you do because the studio was careful about that as to allow players the freedom of role play without worrying is their character would be meta in fights. The story is amazing and the pace between fights and exploring is well balanced.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"In my gf case it's games where you don't have to move a camera around manually.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My timeline for getting my non gamer gf into games:

Typically when I get people into games I start with Slay The Spire

1.) Slay the spire, teaches them critical decision making while also being fast past. Scale of the game isn’t overwhelming and creating your own win condition is rewarding

2.) Brotato. My GF loves Brotato. Similar to StS, game is small scale while giving you the tools to create your own win condition. The silliness of a potato fighting aliens also eased her into what is essentially a small scale arpg. This game also taught her the importance of stats and abbreviations: HP, Crit., Crit Damage, Life Steal, etc. she became familiar with these concepts and each run let her focus on one or the other.

3. 20 Minutes till dawn. Basically Brotato but now with different characters whose abilities impacted the gameplay. She enjoyed the dark art style and limited vision the game, it was like a more intense Brotato.

4. Don’t Starve Together. At this point she’s familiar with a controller thanks to the simplicity of Brotato and 20 minutes till dawn, now it’s time to play with her and guide her through an adventure. I explore the world of DST by her side, explaining how to do things, how inventory works, inventory management, and base building. I give her specific task so she doesn’t feel overwhelmed by a survival game. She’s responsible for meat farm maintenance while I gather resources.

That’s where we are currently. She really likes Don’t Starve. The next game will likely be a JRPG, but a simple on like chained Echos. You heal after every battle and there is a great/dark story.

Games that didn’t  work:

Portal 2, Monster Hunter, BG3 early access, Valheim"

My partner is waaaaay into gaming now. She has a PC better than mine at this point. She really got into it with Animal Crossing on the switch.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Hack and slash top-downs have been really good fun for my GF and I. She isn't a complete beginner but does struggle with controls and whatnot. The action RPG's are the most rewarding for us being a nice mix of simple fun action + a feeling of development over multiple play sessions. Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Alienation (playstation), Dark Alliance, Grim Dawn, Champions of Norrath, Victor Vran.

I would also add that after a little bit of time if you're looking for more coop games, Resident Evil 5 and 6 have really great co-op experiences. Slow-moving horror/adventure splitscreen FPS. Very fun. But that would be after she gains a bit of experience and confidence. Dead Island 1 is also really awesome co-op experience and worth looking into"

Unrelated, but my gf who never played before had a lot of fun when I introduced her to trackmania. Easy to understand, gives a sense of accomplishment, and also it’s something she knows I enjoy, which all helps. She still doesn’t really play any games and we haven’t played in a while, but atleast she had fun. Also keep in mind that gaming is hard when you’re new, so getting a lot of feedback on what you could/should do probably just makes the experience less enjoyable"

All you the controls you have to master is moving around/looking around. Slow paced, controller support.

The story is really engaging, and the puzzles and simple and challenging !

And almost everything else is there to blow your mind, the music, the arts, the narration. (The game involves a lot of reading tho)

No matter which game you come up with to introduce her to gaming, let her play it her way. Don’t worry about how you would play the same game, and don’t try to influence her experience based on your own! It’s an easy trap to fall into! And I’d like to say that I’m not assuming you will, but it can be exciting to introduce someone into a hobby you love, making it even easier to fall into this trap.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Is there an IP your girlfriend already has an interest in? That can be a motivating factor to push through the difficulties of learning controls, etc.

This is personal experience, but my partner was a non-gamer that had an interest in learning. This was right after the first season of The Witcher came out, so I recommended The Witcher 3 because they were invested in the world. There was a steep learning curve, but wanting to know what happened to the characters pushed them through. Now they play games as much as I do.

The key is patience. They're going to make mistakes. Don't jump in to correct them or offer to do something for them. Give them tips if they ask, but let them go at their own pace. Tell them it's not a failure to mess something up in a game and give them the time to learn. 

A lot of times when I hear someone say they tried to learn games with their partners they say they gave up because they felt embarrassed. I believe this embarrassment at being bad at it is driven by ""taking the controller"" behaviour or a lack of patience from the person teaching them. Make it a relaxed, low pressure environment. 

Tl;dr: A game they have an interest in will go farther than a game you recommend because it is easy. Be patient and kind."

The naughty dog games are good about having very easy modes where you won't die but they will still feel like games. The telltale games could be a jumping off point too. Mass effect has a easy mode as well.

Why? Simple, teaches you a few things that carry over to other games. Cheap to buy. Great for 1v1 action to get her acquainted with online. 

The premise is simple. Kill you opponent.

The game is old and can run on any PC. Get two machines and link them up on LAN amd play together.

She will learn wasd, mouse look, voice chat. Trust me when you start talking trash at each other she will love it. The trash talk with friends  is what really gets people into gaming.

I suggest putting them in the same room so you cam come physically help but also use voice comms when applicable. Then at some point start introducing online friends. From there you can start introducing other games."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I'm gonna recommend getting her a hand held system. Like the steam deck or switch. 

But start her with story based games where the controls are added as she plays and not given all at once. 

Start with older games, the triple A's aren't really designed for new players.

Let her figure out controls. Tell her when she asks how to do a thing. 

If she wants to try a shooter, try something unrealistic that isn't fornite. Halo would be good but I know you've got the PlayStation. Try something similar? Aim, shoot, grenade, melee, simple. Less she'll be expected to keep track of us better. Less hud at first is better. Starting with games in third person is usually easier for new players.

Skyrim is a good start for fantasy games. There isn't much of a wrong way to play and the characters are interesting. Avoid the Fallout series until she's more used to a HUD/environmental dangers. Assassin's Creed might also be good to try?

Easy games with few dangers are good for learning to monitor ones environment. Sky: Children of the Light/ Minecraft/ Slime Rancher/ Stray

Games like Grounded are good for teaching crafting elements. 

While I don't personally like it, if she likes Disney, Dream Life Valley is a good one. 

Coral island is very task oriented. I found that it's easier for new players if they're constantly giving the task. 

Dredge is a good game if she likes horror movies or doesn't mind the occasional spook. It also teaches time management and resource Management. 

Either of the little nightmares ones are good for teaching how to keep your character oriented on the screen. I've noticed that a lot of newer players don't have the situational awareness for their character. It's a new skill they have to learn. This one's only good if she likes horror. 

Any of the Sherlock games are great for puzzles and mystery. And forces you to constantly think about the story. It does help that the controls aren't very difficult. 

My Time in Portia / My Time in Sand Rock are good games at teaching her time management without having a rush to get things done. Also, because it's in third person, it does help you keep track of the environment around your character. 

Life is Strange starts with easy controls and slowly teaches you more complex mechanics of the game. 

I don't know a lot of PlayStation games so I hope that I got the ones that I know are on Playstation. Anyways, best of luck to the two of you!"

I have a friend who never was into gaming before, that decided to try playing GTA V on my PC some time ago. It was hilarious, because he reacted to each little thing that we take for granted! Each car crash made him laugh his ass off, and running over NPCs was like watching something out of LiveLeak for him. Having the cops chase him was exciting as hell too, while for me it's banal, since I know shortcuts and stuff with my 130ish hours in the game.

He then asked me to play myself, and I decided to just drive at high speeds and avoiding crashes with Franklin's ability, with him just watching me play. He was amazed, while for me it was the most average gameplay of the game! I'm so used to GTA Online complex stuff, while he found simple driving in singleplayer an awesome experience.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I would have them look up or watch lets plays on a few games. I would start with the ""cozy"" ones and go from there.

The staples -
Stardew valley - has co op if I am not mistaken, has combat (mines) light resource management. It is generally considered a safe game.
Coral Island - much like stardew valley but no co-op as of right now, it's planned but better visuals.
Pokemon - it's not hard to get the basics and get started.
There's also games like Palia or Animal crossing episodes might get two overwhelming too fast for someone completely new.

The Sims 4 base game is free - no combat if they are worried about that, tons of months and cc's to make the game how you want on PC.

Something like the paper Mario series or some of the other Mario games. There's a reason that Mario's a classic. Princess peach was just released.

Cozy / City building -
   If you guys are in two more medieval things Manor Lords is out now. However there is combat where you have to direct troops and people raiding you. People are comparing it to another game called banished.
   Wandering Village - tiny city building / environment changes which can damage you.


It also kind of depends on her interest, if there's someone who likes you and to go to sleep and things out maybe City skylines would be a good idea it's like SimCity. 

I would have her look at certain channels like Sarah Sunstone please almost only cozy games. I would find things that but she likes to do in real life as a bridge into gaming.

Do they like to drive or watch nascar, thinking I'm a racing game, are they into gardening well maybe try gardening life, are they secretly a city planner then City skylines would be a good deck or another city building type. They have games that were completely on engines for if you're into mechanical engineering, I would truly look at what they enjoy in life and then find something along those lines. 

However I do not suggest Mario kart- it gets too frustrating too fast if it's your first game. Also I wouldn't suggest anything like the Wii games where you're using your body or VR, you want to find ""regular"" games- games have fit inside genres like racing, cozy, RPG that's sort of stuff. I didn't list any RPGs because those can be kind of hard to get into if you're not already used to what an RPG is, however if you guys play D&D or something along those lines heck yeah start with RPG!"

• Sackboy: A Big Adventure - Relatively simple platforming, no camera controls, cute environments and fun costumes to create and customize.

• Minecraft (on easy or peaceful mode) - sure, there's a lot *to* Minecraft, but the basics are very simple. This will get her used to standard video game mechanics such as movement, camera controls, aiming at targets, and item management.

• Lego games - pick a franchise she's into from the list of Lego games, and try it out. The controls are pretty simple, and there'll be some platforming to get her better used to that as well.

• It Takes Two - other people have suggested it and it has been shot down due to it requiring a little video game knowledge, but after going through the previous games, this shouldn't be too bad to tackle.

• Skyrim or Fallout - if she wants to start stepping out on her own, these are both good for getting into. Difficulty slider is still available if she's not picking it up quickly. Alternative suggestion if she doesn't like the vibe would be Horizon: Zero Dawn, not as much customization on the playstyle, but third person view can help some people (and also gets her more prepared for action games rather than just RPGs)

• Fortnite - I know what you're thinking, and hear me out. Despite the community, Fortnite is actually really solid for starting off, especially just due to the absolute variety in it. Zero Build mode has a lot of bots, so she can get into competitive gunplay without being stomped (or having to worry about learning to build), Rocket Racing is a good intro to racing games, Festival Mode (basically Rockband) is just chill fun that can help with reaction times, and Lego Fortnite is a viable substitution for Minecraft if you don't own it and don't wanna pay for it.

By this point she should be well-versed in the way video games work and feel. It's up to you at that point to guide her into the things she will like and the things you'll enjoy together. Good luck!"

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Alot of people are mentioning Mario and other Nintendo games but alot of people, myself included, find Nintendo games really boring and childlike. You need to put her on a game that has an easy concept to pick up and an addictive loop that will pull her in. Games like Mario get really boring really fast for me because it's the same thing with little reward other than making it to the end of a level. In my opinion, Vampire Survivors would be the perfect game for a first time player as long as she can stick it out long enough to get past the first map. It has a just fast enough pace and a really rewarding loop system that has you always wanting to go ""just a little bit longer"". Either that or just go the Skyrim route Lol."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Most people who haven't played games are more familiar with movies and TV for pacing. Turn-based RPGs with strong enough stories would be my recommendation with minimal execution concerns. Been replaying FFX on my Vita, and as cheesy it can be sometimes, pacing is... fine for sit down and play for half to one hour."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"ehh depends of what kind of games he'd like. For RPGs I'd go with Skyrim because it's simple and easy to wrap your head around. Even non-gamers will look at someone playing it and will be interested, in watching for a mijute or two at least. It's not as vague and doesn't require ""gaming"" knowledge.

RTS? Probably some with recognizable things, like little tanks and soldiers. Or something medieval, because all boys like knights and archers and cavalry and castles and catapults and stuff like that. An Age of Empires game maybe? I know some friends who liked Stronghold because you're collecting all kinds of resources and things like that. 

Boys like sports or shooters most often, even if they couldn't be bothered to try out any other genre. At least that's what they liked to play in public game rooms, from my experience.

I know girls usually like The Sims games, or things like Zoo Tycoon. My cousin liked Fable and a funny-looking car racing game, for some reason. I've never seen a girl play an RTS, and rarely an RPG or maybe a colourful shooter. well, I'm sure there are exceptions."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"For learning controls-


Journey for 3rd person camera


Portal for 1st person


Mario for everything else"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"So, let’s start with breaking down game design a little bit. The challenge of a game tends to come from four primary sources/resources: Time, health, movement, and knowledge. Most games utilize two of these, while games known for their difficulty use three or all four. Likewise, easy games use only one, or allow you to selectively disable part of the set. A classic example of this is the Yoshi series, which lets you enable “mellow mode” to make it impossible to die via falling in holes. 

Since Switch is out, pick up something low stakes that uses her preferred resource. If she likes puzzles, try something like the Monkey Island series to get her used to moving with a controller and interacting with her environment. Knowledge is the key resource, and while movement is involved it isn’t used in a way where she has to have mastery of it to not die. 

If she wants something she can play with you as a carry, It Takes Two is fun with an engaging story, or pick up a copy of Diablo 3 on PlayStation for couch co-op and start on the super easy difficulties. 

If you wanted a reason to acquire a Switch, you won’t find a better one. Nintendo is imho the undisputed king of beginner friendly games, from Animal Crossing to the more recent Mario games where you can play multiplayer, and she can “bubble” herself to let you solo through the harder jump sequences. Plus, it lets her play something easy on the couch in handheld mode while you’re playing a harder game on the TV. It gives her a space where she can learn at her own pace without feeling like she’s tying up resources if it takes her 20 min to nail the muscle memory for something we could do in a single pass."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Play something cooperative with her, like an MMO.  I started dating my first serious girlfriend by playing World of Warcraft (this was back when WoW was still hard).

I still favor WoW for beginners because the storytelling is great and the devs have done a lot over the years to improve quality of life and make it more accessible to beginners.

Or, if you’re a Star Wars fan, try The Old Republic.  Or either of the Knights of the Old Republic games for a solo experience.

I liked playing MMOs with my first GF because it was cooperative, low pressure, and we had fun.  On nights we couldn’t be together, we could still have “dates” in the game.  Just don’t be pushy if she sucks at first, just have fun.  We created new characters together just so we could level up together instead of me just having a heavily geared character smashing all the monsters for her."

A plague's tale - Innocence

A plague's tale - Requeiem (The sequel for innocence)

Hellblade - Sennua's Sacrifice

  
After that I'm pretty sure there are telltale games and other choice driven games (Heavy rain, etc) that fits the genre - I haven't played them personally but so far I see praises for those."

dead rising 2 off the record sandbox mode and dead rising 4 are also very fun sandbox zombie games to just fuck around in and shut your brain off (the other dead risings only have modes that have timers and would not be good for beginners)

other recommendations would be bloons tower defense 6 (tower defense), disco elysium (very lore-heavy visual novel-esque rpg with no complex combat or controls), forza horizon (racing), spongebob squarepants: battle for bikini bottom and cosmic shake (3d platformers), minecraft, stray (exploration)"

Since she was more of an old school gamer, she wasn’t used to all the buttons and joysticks. Then I downloaded that power washer game (it’s on Game Pass, not sure if PlayStation has it) and she loved it. She picked it up pretty quickly and started playing that.  Then we got a Switch and now she’s playing Mario Golf, Mario Kart, Mario Party 8 and all those types of games.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I'd definitely keep it 2D. Basics like moving and controlling a camera is something we don't waste a second to think about but it can be very overwhelming for someone new to the medium.

I'd say stardew valley, kirby games or maybe something turn-based could be a good introduction for someone to get started."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"So my girlfriend has always been close but on the outskirts of gaming and a year and some change ago I got her a steam deck. Here’s a list of some games she’s played to completion:

Stardew Valley (still playing actually since I got her the SD Expanded mods)

Hades

Spirit Farer

Ori and the Blind Forest

Katamari Damacy

To the Moon

Unpacking

A Short Hike

Night in the Woods

Fall of Porcupine 

Telltales Walking Dead Season 1 and 2

Telltales The Wolf Among Us

Bastion

Gris

Frog Detective 1-3

Little Misfortune

A Little to the Left

Monster Prom 1-3

Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion



There’s several others that she’s put some time into that she hasn’t finished yet or bounced off of entirely. I’d say most of these are pretty good choices for a beginner. Maybe leave something like Ori or Hades for when the controls become a little more familiar as a way to graduate to a new tier of skill. As it stands though, she still has major trouble using the right stick to look around in first or third person mode in games that allow it but it’s a work in progress."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"On PS, I usually recommend *Little Big Planet* and the respective games. It's fun, it's cute, easy to pick up, lots of great simple platforming games to get used to playing, so on and so forth.  
Although, I remember hearing some news about the servers or something but I can't quite remember what, so worth looking into it.

The LEGO games are all absolute gems to get started with. Especially if she's a fan of one of the movies they're adapting, like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. It's delivering a known story with a twist of humor and whimsy in the form of LEGO pieces.  
LEGO games don't have dialogue, so when Vader drops a major twist on Luke, the game gets very creative and funny on how Vader is trying to portray the information.

Sim games are also really popular with players starting out. Stardew Valley is on Windows and you can play multiplayer."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Whichever ones she thinks look interesting tbh 

I think people largely will just learn things if they’re interested in them, regardless of the perceived difficulty. A lot of people’s first games as kids were final fantasy games, or WOW, or Counter Strike, or even now games like Fortnite, and we all just learned because we wanted to play them. 


Just scroll through steam or show her trailers of things and see if she really latches onto something."

Baby steps at first, creativity to build things, s o m e mechanics to get used to (potion cooldowns, crafting, damage numbers, equipment)

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"The Lego games are great starting places. Controls are simple, puzzles aren't too difficult, stories are familiar but with Legos brand of humor added in, and  the levels have a lot of replayability as only certain characters can do things, which means later you can come back to a level with new characters and it plays in a different way.

Dark Souls has a reputation for being mind numbingly difficult, but imo? Anyone can beat it, or at least reach Anor Londo. 

He still doesn't use the camera stick unless he's completely stopped moving, but he's beaten all but Bed of Chaos so far, near 100% at this point.

Of course I did and still do have to help navigate and warn when to heal, or give tips, but what DS does that damn few achieve, is make the aid of the community make the game make more sense, and not appear impossible or insurmountable.

Be patient. It will take a while for them to get used to things, but I assure you, out of any game I could've chosen, this was a surprise and not at the same time. My grandma can probably beat Dark Souls so long as I guide her and tell her not to upgrade resistance ever.

He still wants to boost resistance. That's how little of a gamer he is, yet it got him into gaming, now he's renting games here and there, playing BotW n stuff. Good stuff, but it'll depend on the person."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I would recommend maybe platform game rather than open world, as they can be quite overwhelming and they have simple mechanics. Jump, charge, flame.

Something like crash bandicoot, spyro, ratchet and klank, Lego series. If you’re wanting to play something together; Overcooked, untitled goose game or it takes two would be my recommendation. 

I also found the early assassins creed was quite gentle way into open world, as they are very structured and the fight mechanics are quite simple. I got into gaming later in life so went through this process, so can speak as someone who had to really figure things out who didn’t get basics!"

palworld is another good free one that is multiplayer or could be solo if she starts her own world and the settings are customizable and open world, elder scrolls online is another open world game that is fun and beginner friendly, or skyrim since it’s good with a decent amount of backstory, i would say battlefield 4 but depends on if she’s into multiplayer games or not or there’s good old fallout and assassins creed.

I was going to say overcooked but if you are competitive, the game can get very rage inducing and might cause an argument so if you choose that proceed with caution."

If she thinks it is way too slow, or farming isn't her cup of tea, try some arcade fighting games. Start with brawlhalla, if she's keen on learning combos, street fighter or Tekken may be for her. If she gravitates to a single character, try some adventure style games like Spider-Man.

Sit down with your girl to watch that video together first, then ask her what sort of things appeal to her and go from there.

My wife for example is def not a gamer, but very much enjoys puzzle platformers (she honestly crushes them), and cats. She does NOT enjoy games that ""make (her) decide things"", aka RPG elements with skills and items and stats to read through, fiddle with, and pick from.

If you want her to actually genuinely enjoy your hobby, foster her organic discovery of her own joy in it. Don't try to drag her along to catch her up to speed in what you're a pro with unless she asks for that."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"For PS5 my partner was interested in playing games and never really got into them. We started with little big planet. Then I got her Sackboy adventure and we'd played couch co-op together. From there we played fall guys (taking turns) and I introduced her to other things (some she liked, some she didn't). After a while we got her a PS5 of her own and she really gravitated toward cozy games, gathering games (cozy grove, cult of the lamb, and Stardew valley), and top down/side perspective (D4, Hades, Guacamelee, Prince of Persia, Spirit farer, Deaths Door, Super animal royale). She's found what she likes and doesn't like now and we play things together at times or separate.

Introduce smaller fun co-op things. Let them enjoy what they want and don't push them to like something you do. You will overlap eventually, but like us...let their journey into gaming be fun and enjoyable. Also, don't shit on what they like because the internet hates it. If they like it, let them enjoy it.

So… ASSASSINS CREED: DISCOVERY TOUR

Assassins Creed Origins (ancient egypt), Odessy (ancient greece), and Valhalla (dark ages viking/england)… all have standalone modes called “discovery tour”.

You can travel THE ENTIRE OPEN WORLD… and go on guided educational tours, with no aggro whatsoever.

I bought her the ancient greece one, on steam, for $20.

She logs in and walks through the vibrant markets if Athens, explores the mountainside, villages, swims in the ocean next to sharks and dolphins, sails around the Mediterranean on a boat, rides horses… and throughout the huge map of greece, there are points of interest where if you interact with them, it opens an educational tour. You’re either guided on a history lesson of the place by an NPC philosopher/atchitect… or it’s a voice over narrator talking about the history of this temple, or these docks, or this rock structure…

It’s fantastic.

It has taught her the basics of ‘movement’ with a keyboard/mouse.

I also spent 3 weeks in No Man’s Sky, building a huge outpost/town, on a colorful planet I found, and changed the settings to no aggro/damage from anything.

She can explore the town, or run down to the ocean and visit the underwater bases i put around there, or the cavern networks.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I agree with recommendations for Journey.  It's a good low risk introduction to modern dual stick character movement + camera controls.  However, I would strongly recommend signing out of PSN to play the game in ""offline mode"".  The presence of another player could be distracting as well as the fact that they may go around advancing the minor puzzles and depriving your GF of actually learning the game.

Abzu is in the same vein but I think is a bit tougher to come to grips with the controls as the character is swimming instead of walking.

To kick it up a notch, I might recommend Stray, especially if your GF likes cats.  However, there are some parts of Stray that might be challenging for someone with no gaming experience, so that's slightly harder to recommend.  However, the challenging sections are short and fairly spaced out, while most the game is exploration.  So if your GF is having trouble, you could step in and complete those for her while she plays teh rest of the game."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Anything that does not have 3D controls. 3D platformers and FPS is bad for first time gamers. Also, anything relatively low stress, like no time limits with harsh consequences. I know you said you have a PS5, but its library isn't the most beginer friendly. If you've got (or will get) a Switch, Animal crossing and Stardew valley were mentioned here, and are good ideas. stakes, and although Animal Crossing is 3D, it controls like a top-down 2D game. Sidescroller platformers can be okay, but keep in mind old ones. Also on Switch with Nintendo Online, you guys can explore a pretty good selection of classic games of varying difficulties. Even if you don't play all the way through most of them, they're a good exploration of a lot of games. But in that mix, I would recommend Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Zelda would be especially great for someone new, but also wanting something more exciting than Animal Crossing of Stardew. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Story is also fantastic.

If you must stick to PS5, then the common suggestion is generally Astro's Playroom. It's free with the console and a very forgiving, relatively easy platformer. It's still a 3D platformer, so if someone has never played games before, it'll take some getting used to. But at least it's a chill enough one that it's good to learn with. If you're willing to pay for the more expensive PSN subscription, then you've got access to a pretty huge classics library/back catalogue of games that will give a lot of options to explore. Playstation in general doesn't cater too much to brand new gamers, but especially if you dive into some of the classics, there are a lot of platformers that are worth it and will at least make the learning curve enjoyable. Also, Stardew Valley I believe is available for PS5."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Portal, Superluminal, puzzle games. Firewatch to teach how to navigate a game without it being too fast paced to keep up. It also gives her the ""I completed a game."" Sense of accomplishment in like under 10 hours. Story games that are on the rails like Edith Finch are also great. Show her games can be like movies without intense gameplay. Roll out some racing kart types and party games when you feel up to it. Stardew Valley of course introduces her to another element of games but lots of management sims with a comfy aesthetic become a good way to wind down. Vampire Survivors and something like Risk of Rain on mobile are also good entries as non gamers are likely to take interests in mobile games with their tablet or phones. Management and rhythm games might be her type or something like slay the spire which is easy to understand but has good game loops.

Orcs must die 3 is free on Epic at the moment which is also a good franchise. While the story is kind of more linear following the first two you can still appreciate the gameplay without experience. Kill boxes are fun to learn about in defense games."

Tetris/Bubble Bobble, Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Banjo-Kazooie, Animal Crossing/Stardew Valley, The Last Of Us, Pikmin 3, Portal, and Skyrim are the first games that hit me as incredibly accessible examples of multiple different types of games that are fun for very different reasons. I also have a pretty big Nintendo bias.There's also open-ended games like The Sims or Minecraft, or more story-driven choose-your-own adventure games like Life Is Strange or the TellTale games (I don't like TellTale games, but a new/non-gamer might)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Narrative games that have limited controls would be great. Telltale games for example (the walking dead, wolf among us, Batman), as Dusk Falls, Until dawn if she wants a scarier experience"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,To start at “deep end” that’s accessible I’d say 2d hollow knight. For easy and into Harry Potter then legacy even if it’s not the best game imo. My gf played overcooked and it takes 2 but she didn’t grow from those games. Then when she got into cod she wasn’t great but the harder of the game got her to be better with camera. She also loved what remains of Edith finch but these aren’t common game games. Give her something you’d play and see if she likes it. Her genre could be stardew slow type game or she could really enjoy the fast paced fps even if not good at them like payday 2. My gf got into survival games since she can go mostly at her own pace and is task oriented. Plus it’s pve. So things like raft and subnautica she may not be great at but she has tons of fun and gets scared and such and surprised at the simplest things so could be nice. Also deep rock galactic is very friendly
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"An MMO might be helpful to start with. They generally have free trials for newbies and the tutorials at the beginning will help her get used to a lot of the skills regular gamers take for granted (navigating a UI, camera controls, movement, etc.) Then you can also be there with her to help her if she gets stuck or needs some backup while learning the ins and outs of combat. Many will also have some crafting to get a feel for some of the prominent aspects of cozy games. If that ends up being more her thing, you’ll be able to narrow your search down to another genre. FFXIV is a pretty one, but there are a lot of options to choose from at first. LOTR and SWTOR look a bit older, but the combat styles are simpler and a lot of the skills learned there will carry over to other games. If you want to go super simple to get a feel for things, Wizard 101 is still active and while many adults still play it, the game is marketed as family friendly. You likely won’t have to worry about as many uncomfortable interactions with other players there as you would in some other online multiplayers. 

As a note: Be patient and ask lots of clarifying questions when you can! She will likely not know the terminology needed to explain in detail what she likes/dislikes about whatever games you introduce her to. “I don’t like the fights” for a particular game could mean “I don’t like combat games at all” but it could also mean she’s not into turn based games, she prefers ranged vs melee roles, or she finds a 3rd person view during combat to be less overwhelming. Let her know this will be a bit of trial and error as well. It can be very frustrating to try something new and thinking she’s doing something wrong when in reality the game just might not be to her liking. She’ll figure out her gaming preferences over time, but that comes from trying games that you both end up loving and end up hating."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Portal 2. Fairly chill game in terms of stakes (no huge action scenes to get through), teaches the basic controls of FPS games, has a great story that is actually very funny and has a co-op mode that is very fun."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"You definitely want something that doesn't have camera controls first. They will be overwhelming while trying to learn controller. So something like Shantae and the Seven Sirens would probably be great. 

Ultimately I think you should take suggestions from this post and watch the trailers with your GF to have her pick a couple. If she doesn't like the setting or theme of a game, she won't enjoy playing it no matter how easy it is.

As a side note, I've seen some people suggest It Takes Two. While it's a fantastic co-op game, it is not new to gaming friendly. It should be a goal to play it with her eventually, not a game she should start with."

Main take aways for me were: there's a lot of video game language ""language"" we are used to that will not be apparent. Hints about where to go based on the shape of the map or lighting is not obvious to somebody. Exploring the boundaries/limitations of the game in comparison to your imagination can be frustrating some times. Having relatable concepts and actions from the real world is nice. Avoid high pressure situations.

At the end of the day, it's going to depend on the individual, but like others have said: Stardew Vally and Minecraft seem like good frontrunners."

 It Takes Two

Rubber Bandits

Spyro Reignited Trilogy (you may have to help her on some minigames. Set the camera on active mode for her) 

Unravel 1& 2

Co-op Beat em ups are easy to pick up and learn (idk any modern ones since I mostly play emulated Retro Games. Stuff like Streets of Rage/Golden Axe/Turtles in Time) 

Turn Based Rpgs will let her play at her pace. There are some easy ones out there, stay away from Jrpgs for the time being. A good easy one that helps learn the controller would be Bug Fables (it plays similar to classic Paper Mario) 

Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion

Streets of Rogue has a custom mode so you could make things easy (like turn off npc guns so they have to melee. Give yourselves HP regen, etc.) And is co-op so there's that too

Hard mode:

Quite Honestly. Elden Ring. But be present with them through the failures, remind them that you really lose nothing in dying that you cant get back, and that you really don't need to go that specific direction.

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"apart from the obvious… mario, zelda, minecraft, stardew valley etc etc…
I would say baldurs gate 3… hear me out lol… the game gives freedom, simple combat (gameplay wise) but deep combat mechanics. great story. great characters. with your guidance for a dozen hours or even you play coop with her. if she likes it she will be hooked."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I would say platformers are one of the best types of game to start somebody with. Either a 2d one or a simple 3d one that uses a 3rd person view. 

The 2d game would be the ideal start and will help them get used to basic movement and the button layout on the controller.

The 3d game will get them used to camera movement and dual joystick control. The 3rd person view will be less disorienting than 1st person."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"If she likes Disney stuff why not kingdom h3arts to get started, or into pokemon stuff the many pokemon snap super easy. Retail world of war craft is super easy to understand too now. Or sims 4. These are all pretty easy starter type games in my book."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Portal and Portal 2. If you exit that experience not appreciating the medium, you may not like other video games."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Minecraft? You can kinda do anything you want
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It takes two. Really good game, super easy and forgiving. Also you're there with her all the time to teach her. Good story to keep her engaged. Just a great game. 

Honorable mention, minecraft. Maybe after a few games, but still very early on. You can just build and never deal with any of the hard stuff, and you wont be missing out on much. And if shes adventurous, theres plenty of stuff to do. Theres a reason its the most bought game."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,The Simpsons hit and run. Basic tutorial that runs you through everything providing the basics of movement and control etc. while still leaving things for the player to discover themselves
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Start with 2D, then progress to 3D. Do third-person camera before first-person. Moving and looking at the same time is harder than it seems for non-gamers. If they're an oldhead, try starting with things they're somewhat familiar with, ports of arcade games, old Nintendo or Atari stuff, etc.

The OG Super Mario Bros is what I usually start people on"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Elden Ring
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Definitely something easy like Dark Souls
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"For me the starter game is certainlu Minecraft. It is easu to gtasp, addictive and fairly open, but has tons of depth."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,As someone with more then 10k hours in a single game try something basic and then find a game you love and grind that until your good
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,If they don’t mind the content. Gta5 is a great balance between accessibility and fun.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It Takes Two. Play it together. It’s so damn beautiful and diverse, fun, with a moving, deep and positive story. It touches several gaming genres."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It really depends on the person. Nintendo has so many casual games and isn't as intimidating as PC or any other console. 

Animal Crossing I'd say is a great starting point, Stardew Valley as well, but a lot of people get anxious about time management. 

Mario Wonder is my top choice; I got my parents to play and they enjoy it even though they only play the easier levels, and it's just a blast."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I played The Raft with my wife and son. She was brand new to pc gaming.

It is great! Now she wants to check out Valheim after we finish last island.


Edit, for PS5, it takes 2 is good. Or Sackboy Adventures"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Final Fantasy 14 has a amazing free trial if she wants to give that a go. It's an online MMORPG but has probably one of the most supportive communities I've seen in gaming. Lots of freedom within the game to do with downtime like crafting, fishing, gambling at the casino, or just socializing with others. It has an engaging story and is designed for the casual player in mind."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,If I was to introduce someone totally fresh to video gaming I think I might go with Minecraft using the vivecraft mod. Minecraft goes at a slow enough pace and i think it would just be interesting to see how a non gamer handles coming at the title from an angle I am not sure anyone has with minecraft.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My answer to this question is consistently Skyrim. I know so many people whose non-gaming girlfriends, wives, boyfriends, friends have seen them playing Skyrim, thought it was cool, and started playing it and became obsessed."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It Takes Two, Telltale Games, Detroit: Become Human, Until Dawn, Overcooked 1 + 2, Little Big Planet, Jackbox or Trivial Pursuit games, Bomberman, Gang Beasts, Party Animals, certain beat-em-ups/side scrollers like Castle Crashers or TMNT, and several of the Nintendo Switch titles (Mario Party, Mario Kart, Wario Ware, 1-2-Switch, Mario Tennis, Super Mario Wonder, Animal Crossing, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 etc.)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"skyrim 

its a fantasy world in its most perfect form for people to be thrust into

there are so many people that have stories of people who are not gamers falling in love with it (dads, grandparents etc)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Chill games like stardew valley or Animal Crossing, also platformers are a good staring point, I have a friend of mine who doesn't play games at all ask me to try Cuphead, I thought it would be pretty funny because it is a hella challenging game so I let her, but despite me needing to explain the controls to her thoroughly she picked it up pretty fast and ecen beat the first boss, so any game could do just tell her how challenging it will be before hand and she won't have a problem, but I do recommend starying with 2D games because mechanically they are usually less complex and easier to get ibto"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I'd go for one of the more casual fps games, and probably one of the need for speed games"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"When I wanted to introduce my wife to gaming, I used the original Portal.

The thing is, she needed to learn how to maneuver in space with the two joystick system. She needed to understand how to not just run into walls and stuff. The thing about Portal is that for the first 2/3 of the game, there are no enemies, no antagonists, nothing to throw you off, just a chance to learn how to move and how a game functions. It is almost like a gaming tutorial in an of itself. Also, it is short, so you get to ""beat"" the game quickly and feel accomplished."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I don't know if it's available on the ps5 but try little big planet.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I personally learnt with turn based rpgs. Pokemon and ff7 got me into gaming originally, and did not require completlx button inputs or reaction times, and the t got me used to interacting with the game."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"The classics, are really well worked out to get you hooked, dota, lol, wow, counterstrike. You can also show her some streamers that are playing games, see if she likes something"

Those two were great introductions to gaming for my wife and easy to learn."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Spyro trilogy she might find fun and control wise it ain't that complex.  And maybe later on fallout 4. Bit of a weird one that but girls tend to enjoy the more building aspects of that game and when she Is more comfortable I think her building in it and then going off on an adventure would be a good way to get used to more general game things.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Dark Souls, she’s gotta learn eventually."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My wife loves harry potter so she played hogwarts last year when it came out, which is her first game in long time. The #1 issue with new gamers playing something like this is aiming and controlling both sticks. I can’t tell you how many times she would run up the stairs just staring at the ground lmao but she got use to it and beat the game on her own. So proud!"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"To be fair you can absolutely never go wrong with Minecraft but to a new gamer I can understand especially new Minecraft can be a lot to take in. I guess you could go with some hard hitters that aren’t too hard but were staples in the gaming industry, Telltales the walking dead and Skyrim come to mind. But as a Gamer™️ I suggest you lock her in a dark room with dark souls and let the rest happen."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Chuck her in the deep end, give her Battle Toads!

Jokes aside, the main question would be to me, does she already watch you play games? If so, what sorta genres/specific games interest her the most when she does watch?

I’ll echo what others have said however, and say Stardew valley- it’s not “my cup of tea” per se, but it is genuinely a great starting game (or game in general if you’re into that type of thing).

Whatever she chooses, I hope both of you have fun!"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Too bad arcades aren’t around anymore. I would have said 2D beat em ups with joystick movement with 4 to 6 buttons. Final Fight would have been awesome. I know you can get those on whatever console you like or pc now, but they just don’t hit the same as a coin op."

As kids we just decided we wanted to trying playing that cool computer or playstation thing, wherever you started. And you kinda just... went from there.

Take your GF's tastes into consideration. You can stereotype and recommend her something like Stardew Valley, but for all we know she really wants a violent way to vent things and might be better off with DOOM. Won't know until you try.

Halo is kinda the classic co-op shooter and MCC is on Steam and often kinda cheap."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Bingo. I tried starting my wife with portal. She would constantly stare at the floor and ask me what to do. 

So then we started with stardew valley and that went a lot better. Controls are mostly straight forward, we can coop together, and you still get to learn health bars energy and slight combat."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It's true. If you're not used to video games, there are some things which everyone else gets that completely escape you. Even monitoring your health bar, or moving while also shooting, need to be learned.

Why not a story game? Telltale's The Walking Dead is a big hit and easy to play, mostly about making decisions and seeing how they pan out. A few quicktime events, but even if you botch them, you don't lose more than 30 seconds."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"This is exactly why I think Firewatch would be a great choice:

- they can take their time with movement since there are no timers, enemies, or any mechanical threats really

- the story can really grab them and incentivize them to actually finish it

- I’ve found it to be a good example to people with preconceived notions, e.g. “video games can be like THIS??  I thought they were all like Mario/CoD/etc!”"

Banjo was right by that bridge behind Grunty’s castle outside in the starting area. Based on the camera, I had to move kind up and to the right to walk ‘forward’ over the bridge. Forward to me was right. I walked off the side of the bridge like 20 times before my brain could grasp 3D movement haha. I’ll never forget that early gaming memory."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Agree

I got into computer gaming quite late at around 17\* and something I was not prepared for was having to get used to moving with W A S D while controlling the camera with the mouse. My first game was Skyrim and I died on the tutorial because I couldn't figure out where I was going so got killed by the Dragon. At this point my brother who'd been trying to help, fucked off (also I made a really ugly character on purpose lol)

\*Only ones I'd played were Point & Click Hidden Object games and The Sims which are still computer games, I know but they don't use W A S D."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I've been playing ""Kirby and the Forgotten Land"" as Player 2, and this has been a good way to be able to help my wife get her 3D gamer legs without being able to take the lead and just drag her along (bad habit of mine).

Only Player 1 (Kirby) can copy abilities and do ""mouthfulls"", while Player 2 is a Waddle Dee with a spear (pretty versatile kit). Also the camera is always on Kirby, so I have to follow her lead. The only downside is the side challenges are singleplayer-only, which you need to complete to upgrade Kirby's copy abilities."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Absolutely this. My wife doesn’t game and got utterly addicted to this 🤣
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"fully agree.  I've seen Portal recommended many times in other ""games for beginners"" threads and it always baffles me. "
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Yeah, I thought Portal 1 would be good for my girlfriend to get into first person games, but there were a lot of parts I had to do for her and at some point she got so motion sick she had to throw up 😅"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It's definitely not a great suggestion for some one brand new to gaming. However, portal was my first k+m game years ago and I felt it did a great job at teaching the player the mechanics and having 80% or more of the game have essentially no time limit allows the player to really take their time and experiment with how everything works. Compared to other more action oriented games where not figuring out the controls immediately results in death, frustration, rage quit."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Portal 2 on the other hand has a great tutorial that makes sure you know how to move the camera and such before tackling puzzles and the puzzles themselves have significantly less of the quick, timing-related stuff. The game was designed to be more accessible than its predecessor."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,It's a mindfuck at times even if you do play games
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Yes, but it gives you an unlimited amount of time to adapt to those circumstances, it doesn’t harshly punish you for failure, and your goals are always straight forward. It puts almost no real pressure on you at all, and the rare times it does (dealing with turrets for example) it only does so for seconds at a time."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"And yet, I’ve never met a non gamer that tried it that didn’t have fun."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I literally have played this with my mom who hasn’t played anything since Dr. Mario came out lol. Good pick
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Underrated beginner recommendation, this."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Rake in the lake
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Don’t Starve Together is trauma inducing and the most horrifyingly, deceptively painful gaming experience one could imagine.  

Or me and my friends just suck."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Played It Takes Two with my wife which had previous experience gaming. Was not so easy. I wouldn't recommend as a first game.

The game is really great, though."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"if it takes two was created for brand new video game players, the devs failed so spectacularly its crazy.

new players have really bad issues with reaction speed, coordination, and genre norms that massively help direct players in situations where lackluster sign posting was used.

Don't starve together is also terrible, its control scheme is pretty jank, requires alot of knowledge of what to do, and is very time sensitive. i do not think you understand what issue brand new players have."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"That's the split screen co-op, right?"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"It Takes Two is a wonderful game but I'm always surprised to see people recommend it for absolute beginners, I feel like this would be a really rough time for someone who literally has no experience with games unless they're very patient."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I knew a fellow pixel would make the correct suggestions.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,[deleted]
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Solid recommendation.

I loved firewatch. My wife sat with me through my entire playthrough and demanded I stay up until 2 A.M. to finish it in one sitting so she could see how it ended. I think by the end of it she was more invested than I was."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Dude, I played that stuff a few years ago, but forgot about it and it's a pretty good option, thanks!"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Nah dude if they’re unfamiliar with a controller then they’re going to mess up so many QTEs, maybe if you let them play on a keyboard and they’re familiar with it."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"By divinity, you mean divinity original sin? Because i damn sure love those games but i would not place them under easy for first timers haha"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"That's actually a great suggestion! It's simple, fun and engaging."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Not sekiro, but that reminds me of how I showed a friend Dark Souls 3 a few years back and half-jokingly told him that it was as easy as “press this button to lock into enemies, this to attack, and this to roll” (fully expecting him to die to the first few enemies in the game). Dude lived on a literal farm for most of his life, and to give you an idea of how sheltered he was, he had only the slightest clue of what SpongeBob was, and the only games he’d played were Wii sports and some other family oriented Nintendo games. Proceeded to mess around with the controls for a few seconds, said “okay, I think I get it”, and demolished the first boss. Didn’t blink an eye when he transformed into a giant tumorous rat beast.  

Dude just had crazy reaction times. This was a guy who refused to play Minecraft because “I keep dying by falling off of cliffs”"

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-08,I sure as hell have been since
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I second this. The controls are very simple, quick to learn but fun to master. Vibrant, whimsical world with a crazy awesome soundtrack, and levels you genuinely want to play over and over again with so much new to experience even a dozen times in. The sequel We ♥️ Katamari is an absolute perfect masterpiece that continues with the same gameplay but a little extra polish and a lot more content to reward really exploring the levels and mastering the game. I wish I could play them for the first time over again. Just checked and both games have an updated version (Rerolled) in the store and are very, very fairly priced for the $:hr ratio. I dare you to have a bad time with these games."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Wait a minute... 


Arachnophobia? Sorry man, never been into Harry Potter. Wh... what do you mean? Lol"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,WHAT?! Looooool
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Just be sure to say ""let's start with something abit more casual"" before you fire it up."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Dude... I'm with you on this one. Played all of the mass effect games, had a blast. Surely keeping them as a reco to my girl. Thank you very much for reminding me about those because I completely forgot about them"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My sister-in-law played that stuff. Let me tell you, in the beginning, i was like ""whaaaaat? Why are you playing this?"", but after a while, I was like, ""naaaaah, she needs to return to her highly-paid software company, and she needs to adopt the little mechanic girl"""
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Oh yeah I second dragon quest builders, my wife absolutely loved that game"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,[deleted]
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Thanks, man. This is a pretty damn good option."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Abzu is an excellent suggestion. Asthetically it is beautiful and calm, which I think is helpful to reduce the tension when trying something new. Mechanically it helps teach the typical console control schemes and usage of the dual sticks plus buttons. For new gamers they often struggle a lot with camera control and a game like Abzu will often allow the player to just take their time and enjoy the scenery. This gives them the time and space necessary to experiment with controls and get used to things like scanning the environment and positioning the camera at the same time as moving. 

Flower as well, if it still exists on the PSN."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"MHW for a non-gamer is insane, I feel like your fiancée is an exception here..."

1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Dude, I played all of the Uncharted games, and all of them were amazing!, especially uncharted 2. Definitely introducing her into those games in the near future."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I'm with you, but dark souls for someone who never played a single game in her entire life?


...


 That's brutal, I like your thinking."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,But don't you think it can become overwhelming for a non-gamer with all the stuff that game offers? It's a pretty massive game
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My dude, thanks for your recommendations. She's reading them as we speak, and Sackboy got her attention the most. Gonna try that one out. Thanks"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Yeh, people that play games take it massively for granted. At least for anything 3d."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Mario 64 is not that straight forward.  

The game has a bunch of mechanics that activate depending on movement direction relative to starting position AND you have to manually control the camera most of the time."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Because you can think of video games as having their own language. We, as gamers, know that if you're on pc, the default jump is space x for ps5 and a for Xbox and Nintendo. Someone who has never played games before doesn't know that information we just have ingrained into our brains at this point."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Mario Wonder on the Switch would be a great place to start.  Co-Op gameplay means she can contribute but doesn't get frustrated.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"SMB is so underrated for learning video games. 

The quickest way to learn something in real life is by getting immediate feedback from your mistakes so you don’t make them again. Within the first few seconds of the game, you learn the rules - okay don’t touch moving things, jump over holes, and there’s hidden things to find so exploring is encouraged. Wait, game over?! I only get 3 tries?! Okay better pay attention next time so I can play longer and make progress. 

The levels also have a clear beginning, middle, and end so it doesn’t feel like it goes on forever. I can take a break if I need to and I can incorporate a social element to challenge a friend to go beat my score. 

Someone else mentioned Firewatch which has no real feedback mechanism and to me is just a walking simulator/controllable movie. I love the game but I don’t think it really defines what a “video game” is - where skill can be leveraged to improve and rewarded.

I think SMB3 also takes this to the next level. More fun elements like the different suits, P speed, sliding down hills, and a choice which path to take in the overworld giving some sense of agency."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Ain't a bad place to start
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Actually, Super Mario Bros is a great example of tutorial through action. Level 1-1 the first thing you encounter is a goomba on a flat surface. If you don’t jump, you die. It teaches you that 1) walking brown mushrooms are dangerous, 2) running into dangerous things will kill you, and 3) you can jump over dangerous things to avoid them. It does all of this without actually spelling it out, which makes it feel more like an accomplishment on the part of the player, rather than just following the tutorial’s instructions."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Heresy I'm sure, but I'd actually go with Wonder (which I haven't played) or one of the New Super Mario Bros games. The latter, especially, are a lot easier than the old NES and SNES Mario games."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"starting with a puzzle game seems like a recipe for failure LOL

A new player has to get used to not only controlling their character but also think on how to manipulate that movement to solve the rooms"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Story game got me thinking... 


I had fun with life is strange. There were a couple times where I wondered ""is this really even a *game* though?""


I think you are onto something."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My wife can't use the mouse and the keyboard at the same time. She can either move, or she can look around. It's a completely untrained (rub your tummy and pat your head) skill she never learned."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I agree with this. It's on Gamepass and I enjoyed the story very much. It was bittersweet when I finished
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I tried to introduce my girlfriend to Firewatch but the controls were simply to taxing for her. Fixed perspective titles are the way to go. Anything that removes the need for camera control.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I always recommend Firewatch when this question comes up. It's the perfect game to learn how to use dual sticks on a console controller.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I’d recommend Firewatch as well. That game is fantastic and simple.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I was going to say Pokemon. I started with it, and the older ones are completely 2.5D or top down so you don't have camera controls to deal with like with the newer ones. 

Though there might be others that are better after that, but Pokemon is a fine game to start someone out on."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Maybe it would be easier to start with a 2D game that uses WASD, that way you don’t have to worry about controlling the camera at the same time. Afterwards switching to a 3D game should hopefully be easier, because you only need to learn camera movement.

Something like Terraria, Ori and the Blind Forest, a Short Hike, Stardew Valley, Factorio.

Most Roguelikes are also 2D with WASD, like Binding of Isaac and Hades, but they’re probably a bit too hard to start with."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"My gf played RCT and similar as a kid but was not a gamer as an adult. She started with stardew valley and today, years later, builds spreadsheets for it, has come home with a 5-page printed and formatted outline of valheim and palia tasks she made at work, is a Mongolia domination victory expert in Civ VI and plays OW2 with a top 500 stack lmao"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,It Takes Two 10/10 Would Recommend. Only downside is there aren't a lot of modern games like it. So finding the game to play next is a pain.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I’d wait until they get more experience before starting It Takes Two. My wife has become acclimated to the controller, but she still struggled during many sections of this game. A total newbie would have a tough time.

For complete beginners, it is better to start them with games that have very few buttons."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Did you break up because you made them play overcooked after?
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Check out the Stardew Valley Expanded mod if you get the chance. It's really well made and nothing feels out of place at all despite it adding alot of new content. The main Dev of it even got hired by Concerned Ape to work on the official game, its that good"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Bro if you’re on ps5 it comes with Astrobot. It’s the simplest most enjoyable pure fun platformer. The haptics and controls are great and the levels are vibrant and easy to get through.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Highly recommend Sack Boy. I play it with my GF too and is a great game for beginners that you two can play together
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Any of the lego games are great entries, like lego marvel or lego star wars. They have co-op, infinite lives, and good puzzles. My wife isn't a big gamer but we are currently playing through Lego marvel superheroes, and it offers something for both of us (I can always hunt collectibles in the levels if I get ahead or she needs to solve a puzzle)."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Id do research into games that are more narrative focused and don't require a ton of skill in their gameplay. You have to remember that even things like the button layout on controllers is something that needs to be learned. This approach also allows the transition in the way the media is enjoyed to be less stark since going from passive media to active media can be off-putting for some. 

I can't recommend any specific games because I don't know the interests of the person in question, but you do so I hope you're able to set them up well."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"I would say Life is Strange is a perfect one. The controls are simple, though movement can be somewhat clunky, but it doesn't matter because it's not an action game.

The protagonist is a woman, so that might be good for her, and the story is super engaging and will suck you in.

Then after she's got he controls down for that, maybe try Last of Us, which is a similar story based game but with more action and combat mixed in.

If you haven't played Life is Strange it will be a treat for you to watch and follow along with the story, too.

Just try hard not to be a backseat driver and let her do her own thing."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"PS5? Easy elden ring obviously. 

Lol jokes aside maybe overcooked on PC? It's a pretty fun game for multiplayer. Although my own GF said she hates overcooked cause it's stressful and she has enough stress from her job. 😂 

But you definitely want to start her on something simple, easy to pick up and fun. After that you can introduce her to more story driven games."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,This game saved us during the pandemic!
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"True, but it lures you in with cute, quirky graphics. I never really got that far, but it's always a blast playing with friends. Get stomped by Deerclops -> we go agane."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I died to penguins on my longest run. Who knew they could be so vicious?
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Agreed. 

I did the same thing. 

I thought the whole purpose of the game was to be a kind of bonding experience with your non-gamer SO.

Nope!

One stick moves, one stick has free control of the camera unless you're hitting the target button, jump, double jump, ground pound by jumping and hit crouch while in the air, hold this button to run and that button to crouch and a different button to interact with stuff unless you're running in which case it becomes roll. . .

Pretty basic stuff for me, but my wife was absolutely finger twisted. Took us over 2 hours to beat the Vacuum Cleaner boss, at which point she tapped out."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Was your wife put off by the difficulty at all? I know it's not a super easy game, but I think part of what makes it good is that you struggle together :)"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Yeah. My wife doesn't play too much aside from sims or party animals, but it takes two was a great game for both of us. 

We took forever on some bosses, but had a blast. 

Oh and party animals is also a nice game to play."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Yes, I haven't played it myself, but have watched a few full playthroughs. It's kinda made for a non-gamer partner."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Mario
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Gris.

And stardew valley, animal crossing, little big planet series"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,They can go with easier mode :)
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Kinda funny tbh
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"No problem. It's a good starting point because it's a chill and relaxing game, you make your own goals and engage with the parts of the game you want. There's very little that you can do *wrong* and those consequences are often minor like loss of money and energy. It's a very casual-friendly game while still providing options that entertain most gamers"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"There are giant spiders in Harry Potter, and thus in the Hogwarts game.

The arachnophobia setting replaces the spiders models with something else less terrifying.

Edit: apparently I was lied to about it replacing them with boxes.  It’s now some funky meme rayman looking spider bauble.  It was a mod that changed spiders into angery sentient boxes. "
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"She's 72 and I put it on the tablet I got for her, she played it so much for a few years all the time until the tablet finally broke down lol"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Absolutely agreed, It Takes Two is MUCH simpler.  I suppose if you're always playing co-op, you can carry the other person in Monster Hunter World much easier, whereas It Takes Two you can't carry the other player unless you literally take their controller."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Well the best way to learn how to swim is to jump into the cold water after all ^-^
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"To be fair, I think Mario 64 was a big leap from the 2D sidescrollers of the late 80s and early 90s too.  I remember the camera controls being garbage in that game, and when I go back and hold my N64 controller, I feel like I need 3 hands."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,Yea. I was thinking it would be a slow paced first person view game. No dying or getting shot at.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Leaves you with such a hopeful yet empty feeling. Hard to describe. Great game
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Agree with this. My wife tried a simple first-person view game and she literally became nauseous and had to stop. 

She adores Stardew Valley though and will sometimes play platformers like Ori."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Type A activities for sure
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,I think It Takes Two requires too much dexterity to handle certain areas like boss fights and platforming sections for someone who's not touched games before
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Oh I remember when I got my ps5 and didn't yet have any games for it and saw astros playroom and me and my gf played it together.

We were so excited and had a lot of fun."
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Astro is a legit great game.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-07,"Astros is a genuinely amazing game I’ve played it so much despite having multiple different games purchased now, there’s truly nothing else like it!"
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,Sackboy is such a great game for couples where one isn't much of a gamer. It Takes Two is slightly more advanced but still a great one for one to teach another about gameplay mechanics.
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Life is Strange is a good choice. You'd have time to get used to moving your character and camera without urgency. And since the experience is primarily about the story, the appeal isn't a far cry from a movie or a TV show. "
1cldfcm,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Idk, the frustration is not the difficulty of the actual game but the mechanics. Brand new gamers do not have a muscle memory of moving controls and the camera. They will be running into walls and spinning in circles and looking down to see what button is what every 3 seconds. 

I played it when I first got into games and my hubs would be entirely done with a section and waiting for me while I was still spinning and trying to find out where the heck I needed to even go. 😂😂 not even mentioning the tons of other mechanics it introduces fast af.

It’s a super fun game and I loved it, but I would say get the movement and camera mechanics solidified before playing. Imo"

I'm a 38 year old dude with a wife and 3 boys. 
I don't think I have ever purchased a poster before, but I would buy this framed in a heart beat.

Tetris on the original Gameboy holds a special place in my heart.  I spent most of my game time playing it growing up.  I attribute it to my ability to handle high pressure situations in my now 20+ year IT career.  
 
Back then my high score was around 350,000.  I can't reach that now, of course.  But that doesn't stop me from trying.
I have all of the next gen consoles, but my old Gameboy color is still trucking along, and my teenage boys will play Tetris on it from time to time too.

Let me buy this and hang it on my wall!"

oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-20,Thanks for the tip! I actually posted it there as well.
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-20,"Fun fact: the original Tetris had an algorithm to send the blocks that the player rotated the most, more often. Since the coveted long piece only had 2 orientations and was often used to clear several rows at once in only one of the orientations, players didn’t rotate it often and thus, got fewer of the pieces. 

So if you are playing OG Tetris, called Tengen Tetris: The Soviet Mind game I believe, and want long pieces, rotate the shit out of them!"

oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-20,No problem!
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-21,"Dang, TIL"
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-21,"That ain't OG Tetris though. OG Tetris was written in Pascal I believe. Or some other computer language that let you make shapes out of keyboard characters. Yeah, I think it's Pascal.

Also that algorithm is a very good example of how ""randomness"" works in video games. I always get triggered when someone says ""it's just *random*"" in a  video games and then go on a long preach about RNG algorithms that start with ""*Well, actually...* . I usually cite the original Zelda and how speedrunners manipulated RNG and how heart drops from enemies were not random at all and were determined by your actions."
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-21,That might actually make things worse. The impurities in the water stay behind and can cause corrosion.
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-21,"I'm guessing that's an exception though. The majority of video games will just use a random number generator that takes an input seed from the computer's internal clock, and then use this to generate some pseudo-random numbers, which is as close to truly random as you can get."
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-21,"That's not an exception at all, because they both use the same or similar algorithm, one takes internal clock the other the number of rotations as the seed number. The end result is the same. You can manipulate internal clock as well as the number of rotations. Basically if (x+5)=y then it doesn't really matter where *x* comes from because the formula is the same."
oo9dw8,2021-07-20,2021-07-21,"Yep, exactly, but instead of x+5, it's some [very complicated pseudo-random number generating function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator), which generates numbers that are basically indistinguishable from ""truly"" random numbers, at least in the context of videos games. 

I'm sure you could exploit this in some games if you somehow worked out what the seed was and knew the algorithm (not sure how you'd do this with the internal clock), but that doesn't really make it any less random."

Most popular is tricky.

Knights of Honor - at the time (dam 20 years already) was probably one of the better early examples (really good game as well!)

Celtic Kings - I know it was very popular in Spain if memory serves right.

Tropico 3-5 - I haven't played em but it is relatively known title in the genre.

More recent titles:

Victor Vran

Surviving Mars

Jagged Alliance 3 - wtf when did they made this one hah.

Looks like a lot of the games are/were done Haemimont Games. Mostly strategy type of games or/and variations on the genre.

There are some Assassins Creed games or Total War  games - that were worked on Ubi and Creative Assembly studios situated in Bulgaria as well. Not sure how many can and be called (fully) made specifically here."

1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-29,"Everyone makes fun of EA as where good gaming companies go to die. Don’t play sports games at all actually have no idea if they make good games or not. Presumably they are doing something right or they would have died out a long time ago.

Actually applied to be a playtester there about 20 years ago, didn’t get hired I’m sure in part because I had never played any of their sports games."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Last Stalker game was released 15 yearts ago. And you are seriously comparing it to Metro franschise? 

Among the gaming community stalker is way more popular, has mods, memes and entire subculture related to this game. Metro is just prettier version of the Stalker with the similar plot."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Okay, someone could just mention other Ukrainian games. I could also mention Cossacks, for example.. Honestly, I just named the most popular Ukranian franchise."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"I picked up Armello and Obliteracers in an Aus bundle a while back. Both solid games from small studios here

Also Powerslide from back in the late 90s was a banger of a racing game"
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"It had some amazing games, no judgment here."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,It's good for gaming that it's global - all the different cultures involved make for a much richer gaming world than if it was dominated by one or two countries. Still wish the UK did a bit more than it does tho!
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Well it wasn't a good one.

A good one would have been they are British when they win, Scottish when they lose."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Nah I get it and it's not that serious.


Idk. Some people get really touchy about that stuff."

1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Which ones from Ireland?
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"I don't think so, but I could be wrong ofcourse. The only somewhat famous game I remember is guns, gore and cannolli."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,They stopped supporting it. But faeria was an outstanding card game made by abrakam studio.
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-30,"NHL 95, NHL 96, and NHL 98 are core gaming memories for me."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"It's not way more popular. It has asmall, active community of its own, but there is no world in which stalker franchise is more popular than metro. It's a simple numbers game. You may not see it that way if you are very absorbed in the stalker series and the community, but from the outside looking in, stalker is extremely niche. Metro is slightly less so, and has sold considerably more."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Yes, that would have been better 😁"
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Pugb.
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Wasn’t the studio which made Doom and Wolfenstein based in Ireland?
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"Stalker franchise sold about 15 million copies, according to wikipedia. Metro Exodus sold 8.5 millions, other games from the franchise had much lower numbers, so the overall sales are comparable."
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,Pubg was not made in Ireland
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"That wouldn’t surprise me, but neither are in the top ten games of all time (sales)"
1gdpjsx,2024-10-28,2024-10-28,"The concept was developed by an Irish guy, the original mod."
m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-09,"These game don't get enough time in the spotlight.  The art style was fairly unique, while the game was engaging and fun.  I would put this up there with one of the best games I've ever played"
m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,Great job!
m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-09,Man the ending was equally loved and hated by me.

m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-09,"Just beat the first one. I never would have played it if it wasnt on PS Now. Great experience, but it wasnt perfect."
m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-09,"The news that the devs wont be working on new ones actually made me kind of hopeful. The world and art style of these games is unique/terrifying/beautiful in all the right ways, and could easily be expanded. But the gameplay sucks imo. I died countless times in both games falling off ledges because i couldn't tell where my character was in relation to the ledge, and i nearly gave up completely in the second game in multiple parts that i couldn't progress for various gameplay reasons.

 If a different team takes over to continue the world while redoing the gameplay, it could be a really great series in all aspects"
m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,thanku :)
m0oq5l,2021-03-08,2021-03-09,It makes sense if you think about six’s character

xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-03,They'll find this in the future and store it in a museum.
xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-03,That looks great. Now kill it with fire.
xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-03,Really cool

xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-04,"I will seriously pay you money for a high-res scan of this piece.  My son loves this game, and a framed print would be a perfect quirky gift for him.  Got plans to do any others?  Something from #2, perhaps?"
xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-04,I’ll give you 5$ bucks for it.

xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-03,"Thank you so much! I’m actually not totally sure because I did it in like 15 sittings over a couple weeks, just whenever I had the time to work on it. Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/TT0mEYRXNZQ) though if you’re interested in the process!"
xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-04,Very yes
xuo71l,2022-10-03,2022-10-04,"I definitely plan on eventually scanning a ton of my canvas art and creating prints for sale. Just follow my Insta for news on that because that’s where I announce new batches of prints.

I’ve actually done some art from LN2 already! It was a large chalk drawing. Here’s the [timelapse](https://youtu.be/mUOoB03DddA) of it!"
1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-27,"This does legit look really good but also because I have the nerves of whatever the opposite of steel is, I could imagine finding this game so stressful to play. I do just love how the game looks though."
1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-28,"whoah ive never seen this before, loved little nightmares"

1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-28,"Check out this new one coming out called Darwake. Looks reminiscent of Little Nightmares:

https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184850/Darwake_Awakening_from_the_Nightmare/

Demo is out on Steam."
1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-27,"The main thing is that there should not be the simplest screamers, when some unknown garbage jumps out at you just like that. The atmosphere should be scary first of all"
1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-27,"Inside and Limbo was good, LN 1-2 too. More good games like these are good, right? 🤔"
1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-28,"Then u have ""shady part of me"""
1cembze,2024-04-27,2024-04-28,Do they need to be horror? **Far: Lone Sails** has similar gameplay to those. Side scrolling 3D puzzle solving with heavy focus on atmosphere. It's great.
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"My vote is Hollow Knight first and Outer Wilds second. Hollow Knight is longer and more replayable, while you can really only play Outer Wilds “properly” once.

They’re both superb, though. Get both if/when you can."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Outer Wilds is one of my favorite games of all time after playing it. I wish I could wipe my memory to re-experience it all over again. 

I haven't played the others unfortunately so I can't give the input you are specifically looking for, but I had to throw a bone to Outer Wilds."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Hollow knight. Definitely one of the best game experience I had. Haven't played little nightmares though.
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Outer Wilds is one of the best experiences in gaming, I didn’t like Hollow Knight too much"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Little nightmares 1 and 2 are super fun at night
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Didn’t play much of Outer Worlds. Not really my jam. But I think Hollow Knight is the most bang for your buck. I really don’t think you need other music either. HK has a really solid soundtrack and is perfect nighttime vibes. Gameplay is really fun too. Bosses are great and there is a lot to do/see. Be forewarned, though. It’s tough. 

Little Nightmares is a fun little adventure too with satisfying traversal and puzzle solving. Immersive and atmospheric too. My wife and I do a yearly Halloween play through of 1 and 2. 

My vote goes to HK, though. For both your personal specifications and for general raw gameplay."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"well playing little nightmares and hollow knight at the moment its a präferenz thing hollow for the exploration and little nightmares for horror and puzzles 

havent played outer wilds"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"I wouldn't play Outer Wilds or Little Nightmares at night, tbh. :)
Hollow Knight would be my recommendation. It's beautiful, the music is indeed great. It's even not TOO hardcore."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Ori ftw
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,U should try out [Road 96](https://youtu.be/eFHU0B_2CPg)
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Hollow knight if you are over 20... under 20, idk."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"I dont think these posts are against the rules of this sub, but I would direct those questions anyway to r/ShouldIbuythisgame , they'll probably be of better help"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Little Nightmares is too short imo, I beat it same day in like five hours and only that long because I’m just kinda bad with problems solving."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Did you play little nightmares?
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Is it a hard game?
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Not too hardcore? Dude have you done the pantheon? I've platinumed it and that was my last trophy, it took me nearly 6 months 3 of those were dedicated to absolute radiance 😢"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Why you would not play outer wilds at night?
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Literally the hardest platinum trophy of my life.   

Hollow Knight is seriously hardcore... There is a reason people compare it to Dark Souls"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Thanks
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Its a much smaller game than the other two which is why if you care about longevity it should be the last you play of those
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Hollow Knight gives you the most money/replay value. Outer Wilds had a more meaningful story/experience imo, and Little Nightmares 1/2 are fun n creepy indies---but they are very short."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Nah, I haven't. It was never really big on my radar."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,Outer wilds is kinda walking simulator. It has no battle system and I met almost no platforming here. You just exploring little star system and finding out how to explore it more from gameplay perspective.
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"It gets tough but it's a mystery game so it's not impossible. It presents all the information you need to solve puzzles, some of them just require some out of the box thinking or other puzzle pieces to understand what to do."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"No, I tried the pantheon and decided it was not worth my time and that it could make me hate the game I loved. I meant the story part of the game (including the ""good"" ending)."
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-27,"I feel like they do a great job of letting you feel like you’re done at most reasonable skill levels. It is totally valid to just be able to beat the Hollow Knight, only beat Radiance, or go all out and beat the final pantheon. No shame in only going as far as you want to, so it doesn’t need to be as hardcore as it could be if you don’t want it to"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Not OP but I have this very primal fear whenever I'm  playing a space game, maybe because of its sheer scale and.. emptiness. Thinking about how it actually is out there is a bit anxiety inducing. You can guess how I felt when a certain mechanic started.

It's so much of a pain that I actually couldn't play OW more than like an hour before I completely dropped it, even though it's exactly my type of game"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"Last horror game I played at night was Clive Barker's Undying. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, so now I tend to play horrors (or games with disturbing elements) by daylight :)"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"My bad, yeah the main game is art"
11cos8y,2023-02-26,2023-02-26,"I admit, pantheon is a cool part of the game, not some senseless gauntlet, I know that. And I applaud your dedication to get to the truest of endings, really.  
I just not in a mood for additional suffering currently. :)"

1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I did the Dark Souls thing: wander from Firelink into the graveyard toward the Catacombs, get killed over and over, tell myself that it's supposed to be hard, I just have to persevere. Persevere. Drop the game in disgust. Pick it up three months later and... have completed it multiple times, including a onebro run."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Tried and dropped Subnautica about 3 times. It's one of my favorite games now
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Sekiro took me a couple times to get into but it is an excellent game

1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,cyberpunk 2077 couldn't get passed the first hour but then something clicked and i started having fun
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Yeah, Little Nightmares didn't grab me either. It's a beautiful game, but it just didn't hold my attention beyond the art style. The control was too floaty and the puzzles too simple. I stuck it out for a an hour or two, but eventually just moved on to something else.

As I've grown older I've felt less and less like I need to stick with any game that isn't completely sucking me in. I have an overwhelming backlog so it isn't like I'm hurting for things to play. Why waste my time with things I'm only engaging with to check off a list?"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Once, for Dragon's Dogma. Most of the time if I don't like I game from the outset I don't return to it. Most recent game I dropped (for a second time) is The Evil Within. A game that makes it too easy to be killed multiple times right in the beginning is not my idea of a fun time."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I tried Witcher 3 twice before it finally clicked in my brain. The combat system was like taking turns - you couldn't just go brute force and attack. You have to attack, attack, defend, attack, dodge, use a sign, attack, dodge etc. You also have to use everything in your inventory to give yourself an edge - potions, bombs, signs, blade oils. 

Once I understood that, I enjoyed the combat more & could focus on enjoying the story instead of dreading the upcoming fight."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Stardew Valley for me. I originally purchased it on steam and played for less than 2 hours and refunded. Bought it again at a later point on switch and played for a bit but didn’t get hooked. Attempted a 3rd time and absolutely loved it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Mass Effect took me so many tries to eventually not get bored exploring the citadel. Eventually got through it like my 4th time trying, years apart, and it's one of my favorite RPG franchises now!"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I started Baldur’s Gate 3 five times before it finally took.  

I’m on my 3rd play-through now, and have put over 200 hours into it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"took me 3 times to get into poe. dropped it at first cause i didnt know what to do after the campaign. 2nd because i didnt know why i kept exploding in maps. 3rd time a new friend held my hand to end game.

4000+ hours now and cant wait for poe2 to do it all again"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Prey 2017 3 times. First time, I HATED the game and complained to my friends about it. Seconds time, I got a bit further but got bored and then distracted with competitive games. 3rd time, I played it and became obsessed with it, finishing the game only to instantly start over and do another full play-through right after! It’s now my favorite game of all time"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Took me years to get into Monster Hunter World. I probably started it and quit in the first hour or so 10+ times since it came out. Finally played through it a couple years ago and had a great time. It still took a while to click for me. The Witcher 3 is another to a lesser extent. Only took 3 or so attempts, but when I finally got through it + all the DLC, it was immediately one of my favorite games ever."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The Outer Worlds took about 3 attempts but loved it once I got into it, really looking forward to the next one now."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Bioshock

Just never really enjoyed it, one day it clicked and I played all of them back to back."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Terraria. I tried playing it like 5 times before i started to enjoy it.  Great game.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,The first Dragon Age. I didn't like the combat at first since it wasn't real-time combat but after staying away from the game for a couple months I picked it up where I left off and I was hooked. Finding an infinite XP glitch for the game also made me come back to it. 😆
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Modded skyrim. I get motivation to play while putting the modpack together then when its time to start new i just lose interest.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I started the game and shortly after I got Red Dead 2. I didn't think I was gonna ever go back to Odyssey because Red Dead 2 stole my attention and blew me away. I eventually went back to Odyssey, loved it and I actually finished it before Red Dead 2."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Demon's Souls and Xenoblade both took me three tries before they really clicked
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"It took me a couple of tries on Tyranny. At first I thought it was weird and not fun. After one last shot I got through the beginning and just absolutely loved it. I beat the game three times after that, on the hardest difficulty, and even on the hardest difficulty with one character. It's a great game."

1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I wish it was something I did. My brain doesn’t work that way and it pisses me off.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Elden ring. Dropped about 3 separate times, usually due to other games coming out or simply life being busy."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Kingdom Hearts. I kept getting lost on the Tarzan level when I was younger. Took me about 3 times to like the game
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,About 15 years of trying Morrowind before it clicked. Once you get the mechanics the game is awesome
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I’ve tried and dropped Nier 3 times. Never had a problem with it but still hasn’t hooked me yet. Planning to try again soon 🙏
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Red Dead 2. Bought it day 1, couldn't get out of chapter one. Five attempts over the years and I was like nah, not for me. Then one day I decided fuck it, let's just get out of chapter one and see how it goes. 

Blew me away. I spent 500 hours in chapter two just hunting and fishing."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Oxygen not included. I kept plateuing and didn't really know there was so much more to do. Till eventually I finally forced myself to try rocketry and thought it was amazing.

Made it to the temporal tear 30 hours later."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I don't tend to come back to a game if I dropped it because I didn't like it.  Closest example I can think of for myself was Reus.  Tried several times to get into it.  Reus 2 did a better job of keeping my attention.  I never really hated it but 2 clicked a bit more and was a more enjoyable puzzle for me.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Red Dead Redemption 2. Bought it when it first came out and got bored pretty quick. Tried it a bunch of times up until this year, where it finally really clicked with me. Now it's in my top 5 list of favorite games all time."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Stardew took a few tries until I finally read through the wiki and saw the wide variety of things to do. Everything felt shallow and surface level from what I saw in the first month and didn’t see the need to drag it out before. Now I’ve got 500+ hours across a a few platforms.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Cyberpunk I tried playing but each time a new game would come out or a new update patch was going to come. I finally finished it last week
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Blasphemous. I liked it only after 3 or 4 years :)
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I think I started and dropped Cyberpunk 2-3 times before the 2.0 update came out and I actually stuck to my game playthrough. I've put in 135 hours since then and it hasn't gotten old.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I’m all around kind of living the one and done life. I wouldn’t even give myself a second chance, I’m not throwing those around Willy Nilly"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Dragon Age : Inquisition starting area felt like such a slog.  Finally read a few posts about it that just said to get out of there as soon as you can.  Once I got past there, I basically just rolled through the game.

Path of Exile was another game that I had trouble getting into but really enjoyed it once I got going.  I think this was due to various updates that improved the game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Days Gone, tried about 6-7 times and couldn't get into it, then a couple of years later had a games drought gave it another go and loved it, got about 92hrs on it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Warthunder. Gave up a few times until I got to grips with Sim mode. Now I’m flight nerding it up with the best of them.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,All Paradox games
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Dark souls 1 and Skyrim

Tried dark souls 1 pc port years ago and it just ran so bad that it was unplayable at the time for me. Picked it back up after the remaster and had a great time. 

Skyrim took many attempts before it clicked. I don’t know, I still kind of have a love/hate relationship with it. Sometimes I have a lot of fun, sometimes I feel hopelessly bored."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,POE took me 7 seasons before finishing the acts
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"My 7 year old brain could not comprehend FFIII, eventually I played Mystic Quest which got me hooked on RPGs"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The first DARK SOULS on the PS3 i kept playing and dropping it for a while, I was getting my ass handed to me by basic hollows the bridge demon was near impossible for me I kept throwing my self at it for some reason.

Until the fate full day it all clicked know I have played almost every soulsborne game besides 2 sakiro and demon souls."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I beat the bloody baron quest line 5 times before I finally continued on afterwards in The Witcher 3. I probably never would’ve beaten that game had I not tried skipping to Blood and Wine and falling in love with it. Something about TW3 didn’t click with me right away and I loved the second one.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Dark souls 2. Dropped like 4 times
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Skyrim when it first came out. Now I own most versions that’ve been released just for the love lmao
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,dark souls 3 and Sekiro I owned for about a year each before I finally got good and beat them.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"It took me 3 years of trying to beat Father Gascoigne. 3 weeks after that I beat Orphan of Kos.

It was worth the wait."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Escape from tarkov, tried to play it like 5 times never had a pc good enough to run/died a million times picked it up this wipe after building a new pc popped off with a few kills and became addicted.... one might make it to extraction but you will never escape from tarkov."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I tried Dark Souls 1 on PS3 about 10 times but never made significant progress on that first boss. Hell, I think I may never have gotten the actual sword.

I had never played any game like that so I guess I had no concept of how it was meant to be played. It wasn't until I saw videos of people playing the game that I finally understood.

And now I'm a big fan of souls likes."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Sekrio, dropped it twice after getting to Genichiro each time and getting stuck. 3rd time was the charm and I finally ended up beating him and then later finished the game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Rage quit Darkest Dungeon twice.

Now it’s one of my favorite games of all time."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Nier Automata.  I’d get bored about halfway through route B and drop it.  Imagine my surprise when 5 years later I found out there was like half of the fucking game that I didn’t know existed. 
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The first time I tried elder scrolls IV: Oblivion (my first Bethesda game) I thought It was awful, it was only after watching a friend play it that I got really into it"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,2 times I think. It was Ghosts of Tsushima
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Witcher 3






The controls aren TOO BAD but I at first didn't really like the actual game itself. 








Geralt seemed like a tryhard, the first pants you have are not good looking, the NEXT GEN GAMING GRAPHICS looked.... Okay(characters were awesome, but the plants an the trees look water color and the swaying from the lightest wind was like the inflatables at dealerships)




And then White Orchard is just straight up doodoo.




I pushed through because it was my monthly game reward with my own and I HAD to finish it. Once I got to Skellige tho, boooyy, that game was beautiful and started loving it. Now I can restart the game, min max White Orchard and enjoy Velen with no issues"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The first time I played Pathfinder Kingmaker, it tooks me months to finish it because I would play a chapter, get frustrated with the system since all my builds were terrible since I didn't understand the Pathfinder 1e at the time, quit, than months later reload myself to try again. It was really bad.

Now that I know the system it's way easier and I love both Kingmaker and WOTR but at the time it was rough."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,When i first played Halo CE i hated it.  A few years later it was my favorite game
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Hades. I was pretty burnt out on roguelikes when this game came out, which wasn't really the game's fault - just the market. It wasn't until my third attempt that I really started to enjoy the game. One of my favorite games in the last few years now."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Final Fantasy XI I've tried 3 or so times and each time I gave up because I refused to follow community guides.

Now it's one of my main stays I get back into every few months because of how cozy it is."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I tried dead rising once in like 2007 then again around 2010 then once in 2023 then finally played through it fully in 2024 and liked it. The other times I got slightly passed the gun shot out in the food court place and gave up.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I deleted Remnant 2 a few times because I just kept dying all over the place. I can't play shooters anymore so I figured I should just accept my limitations.

But then I kept thinking about it and kept trying and once I started making progress I got way hooked and now I've played it for 50 hours and can't wait to get back into it after work."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I tried Death Stranding about 7 times before it clicked for me. Every time I'd start it, I'd end up being like ""really? I have to carry more packages???""

Then after I finally pushed myself through the first chapter i ended up being like ""hell yeah more packages"" the game really is unique and has a flow that can be hard to get into. But if you can find the greatness in it, it truly is an amazingly beautiful game"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Elden Ring took my 3rd attempt to git gud enough.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Elden Ring 4 times. I kept trying to make builds based on what I thought would be cool and it was an absolute disaster. I finally looked up an optimal endgame build and it got a lot easier. I feel like the FromSoft games are a different kind of RPG than I am used to.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Tried Witcher 3 about four times before saying fucking it and committing to actually playing it. 

Also Zelda Breath of the Wild. I left that game to sit for about 4 years before picking it up again. I no-lifed it this summer, immediately followed up by TotK and now I'm stuck waiting another 4 years for the potential next game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Not a spesific game, but generally souls like or anything fromsoft made.
I tried multiple times on multiple games, tried to like them but i couldn't. I like the atmosphere and vibe, but i never get into them.

Until the elden ring. I actually can get into this one. I dont have any particular reason, but im guessing you can grind in the game without fighting a single boss.
I beat the game (including dlc) at lvl 359 :D"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Insomniacs Spiderman first got the hooks in me on my 4th attempt. But holy shit I was hooked from there. The same with Arkham Knight.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Just started Skyrim for the 3rd time last week and actually digging it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Just started Skyrim for the 3rd time last week and actually digging it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Once. For honor.

I broke 2 controllers and a desk. Wall has a crack too.

Months later started to play again"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Elden ring it took me around 5 different saves to finally beat the game and now i have beat it like 6 times 😭
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I've dropped Earthbound 3 times now. I do enjoy it but for some reason I lose momentum in happy happy village and stop shortly after.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Factory based games, tried playing satisfactory twice and dropped it. Played Dyson Sphere Program like 3 times and finally completed it on the 4th attempt. I find it very daunting to set up automation tasks that if you don’t plan ahead enough, turns into a mess of spaghetti and confusion. But I loved the concept of the game so eventually stuck it out and watched a ton of playthroughs"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I think I dropped Sekiro three times before it sunk the hook in me.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Several times with different games. Hitman, Metal Gear, the Witcher. Final Fantasy. Hitman took me about 4 tries over a couple years before it clicked. Metal Gear broke my dumb Pizza Hut fueled brain and took me 25 years to beat.  Witcher 3, 3 tries over a year coincidentally. However, I loved the Witcher 2 Day one on X360 so not sure what that was about. Cities Skylines I’ve tried probably 6 times and I can’t get into it and it bothers me. Similar to Civ. Tried a bunch, never clicked. And the last one I can think of is Final Fantasy? Like all of them lol. I remember trying to play FFX when I was a kid and it seemed too feminine (see: cultured) than the other games I played. Which is weird because Kingdom Hearts was and is my GOAT game. I tried FFX again 6 years ago in college and I was like “I do not have the time to respect this game” Now about 20 years later from the start I’ve played a bunch of FF games in just the last year. They finally clicked and I honestly think I just needed to grow up a bit or gain more worldly perspectives I don’t really know."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I put Witcher 3 down twice before getting hooked but that’s been my answer before so here’s a new one. Elden Ring. 

I bought Elden Ring about 2 weeks after it dropped because all my friends were on it and kept hyping the game up. They know I’m trash at Souls games. I’ve tried and quit Bloodborne and Sekiro. I know it’s gonna happen with Elden Ring but I bought it anyway. I get my ass handed to me by Tree Sentinel. I leave to explore and I’m getting fucked up by random NPCs and dogs and I immediately quit lmao. But I would still watch people stream and play the game and fight bosses. 

Fast forward to 2024. I hear about the DLC. I see Kai Cenat stream the game and it made me want to reinstall and give Elden Ring another shot. I watched a couple other people stream the DLC. I looked up some guides on how to play and how to have a functioning build and reinstalled Elden Ring in mid July. I already have nearly 230 hours into the game. I beat the main story a few weeks ago (Chaos Ending) and I just started the DLC. After I beat the DLC, I’ll do a NG+ run and then I’ll give Bloodborne and Sekiro another shot."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I dropped Baldurs Gate 3 like 3 or 4 times before I took it seriously and now it's in my top 10 favorite games
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Bloodborne, bought it in 2015, it was my first Souls game, and i was 15, i must have tried at least 3 times to go back to it each year for like 3 years, until a friend teached me how to play and that’s when i fell in love with the game and the Souls genre.

The only ones i haven’t played are DS2 and Sekiro, but Bloodborne remains my favorite."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Tried Warframe a few times from launch in 2014 - 2017, each time I checked it out I liked it a little more, as the game did objectively get better in many areas. Then in summer 2017 it finally clicked and I became obsessed with it until I burnt out in 2021."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"RDR2. Tried it like 3 times and I really want to like it, I’ve seen mid/late game clips and I think I would enjoy this game a lot but I just can’t get through the beginning… maybe one day."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Not finished yet but i still hold hope on fallout new vegas. Started it 5 times, dropped 5 times. Maybe 6th is the charm"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,My experience with little nightmares has been the same. But I do intend to try it again for Halloween season coming up
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Unrelated but could you tell me what the similar games are? I really like LN and want more like it,  I've played Inside and Limbo before"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I feel like most games fail to grab me right away. For instance, I just finished “The Pathless” yesterday, and it took me about two hours to “get it”. The problem with that game, and many others I struggle with, is that gameplay is not sufficiently explained, so I’m not sure what I need to do to progress… it’s just too much “open world”, when what I really gravitate towards is a clearly laid path."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Took me about 4 tries to beat fallout 4 because my saves kept becoming unplayable from crashes
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Took me a couple years after purchasing DS3 before I beat the first boss after attempting it a couple times and then dropping it for a few months and then trying again after a while I eventually beat the first boss after sticking with it but gave up no too long after until eventually I told myself I had to beat the game. When I committed to it I fell in love and I am now a huge souls game fan and have played the shit out of most of them.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Escape From Tarkov.... I uninstalled in rage only to reinstall it a few days later like... 3 or 4 times. Then PVE mode came out and my friend and I play the game non-stop.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,2nd attempt at playing Gravity Circuit after a year and I just 100%'d it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Played God of War 4 times before finishing it. Now i even have the platinum trophy. With Bioshock I still can't finish it, but I'm gonna do it eventually."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Red Dead 2 I've tried 3 times and Cyperpunk 5+ times. Red Dead 2 is just so boring to me and the missions so slow and confining. Nobody in either of these games interest me enough to want to get to know them better. And the gameplay is just not fun enough on its own to make me want to continue either. 

My goopy goblin gamer brain just likes different settings than these and more engaging/challenging gameplay."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The original Deus Ex. Took me like 3 times and getting toHong Kong before it finally all clicked. The ideas in that game were basically all new to me, I was used to games like Unreal Tournament. In fact on the first level I instantly killed the terrorist leader with the GEP gun because I expected a boss fight. When Alex was like ""Why did you kill him JC ? We could have interrogated him"" I was surprised as I had never played a game like it before and didn't think bringing him in was even an option.

It's one of my favorite games now."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,It took me 3 times restarting over a year to finally get into The Witcher 3. By the end of the third I put 160 hours into it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I still haven't finished RDR2 or Days Gone. Tried about 4 times each to play through them and just can't do it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"0.  If I don’t like it then unless I change what I like I have no reason to go back to it. 

Sometimes my mood/mind isn’t up for certain types of games though. So if I hadn’t played one before I may boot it up and see if it is a fit or not. If not then I file away what style of game it is and come back when that mood strikes."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Struggled with some games like this. DRG, droped it after 7 hours then came back months later for 300 more

No Mans Sky, tried it at least 3-4 times before clicking. Icarus too.

RDR2 and Star Citizen were contenders but i just can't"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,3 times restarting Last of Us. Always loved the story but got frustrated with sneaking around and low ammo/weapon crafting.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Resident Evil Village for me. I must have deleted and reinstalled it a dozen times before finally getting into it. I think what changed for me was that I really wanted it to be a spook fest (which it's not), and it wasn't until I just started playing it like a first-person kill-as-many-freaks-in-a-castle-as-possible kind of game that it finally clicked."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Tried and dropped Elden ring about 3 times before actually finishing the game in like a week. I’m more into figuring games out by myself and not looking at clues and help online.

But goddamn this game is impossible to finish on your own I didn’t even make it out of the first region without looking at an online guide. I compromised by looking online for where to find items and bosses but figuring how to fight bosses and enemies on my own. Made the game pretty fun honestly."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Little Nightmares was exactly the same for me! Then I finally sat down and it was a fantastic, relatively quick weekend playthrough."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Sekiro. Bounced off it like 4 times. Then at some point during Genichiro it just clicked and I pounded the rest of the game (except isshin) out in a night.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Dropped RimWorld multiple times after quick colony failures. One day I just bunkered down and kept with it and now I have like 2400 hours.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"It took me 12 attempts to get into age of empires 3 and then as soon as that clicked, I became obsessed with pretty much all ""age of"" games"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I think it took me 2 years to actually beat Persona 5, must've dropped the game 2 times almost every palace until the halfway point."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Terraria took me 3 separate attempts to get into it. The last one finically clicked and I dropped almost 400 hours in it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Diablo 4, multiple ""free"" weekends, then grinded once it came to gamepass. Lol"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Breath of Fire 5 took a few tries but I really like it these days. Playing Prey Mooncrash and the Golden City helped sell the repeating days concept. It's a shame it didn't work out for BoF. Too weird and experimental for it's own good.

Edit: Also the guy who did FF tactics soundtrack did BoF 5's and its still fucking glorious."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Red dead 2 twice, on PS4, but I just played the first few missions last night for the first time on my 4090, with graphics cranked up, on my new OLED. Maybe I just like the high frame rates"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,First time popped Skyrim in I didn't like so I went back to cod. When I went to play Skyrim again it claimed my whole childhood summer lol
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,dropped dark souls 1 nine times. still don't like it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Minit…. Something about having only one minute to die was putting me off, after reading about it and trying it several separate times, it just clicked and I am happy I got the chance to finish the game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Took me about 6 times over 5 years to eventually love and Platinum Sekiro
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Most big rpgs for me have an initial attempt that lasts a few hours, followed by ignoring the game for about six months, and then fixating on it like a digital drug until it's done. 

Happened with BG1-3, the Pathfinder games, Betrayal at Krondor, Ultima Underworld 1+2, Zelda: BOTW and TOTK, KOTOR 1+2, Elder Scrolls 2-5, etc."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,The Mass Effect Series. I started the first game over 4 separate times before I actually started enjoying it. Now it's one of my all time favorites and I'm trying to find the motivation to do it all again. 10/10 recommend.

1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Dark Souls 1. It was my first soulsborne game and I kept getting further each time until eventually getting stuck on a major boss or area. Finally beat it and it's one of my favorites now but I think I put it down and picked it back up 5+ times before finally beating it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Persona 4. the first time I got near the end of the castle. Se and time I got to the bath house. 3rd time, I beat it over a 6 day vacation."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Baldur’s Gate 3 once, Hollow Knight twice, Witcher 3 four times I think. Glad I saw them through, some of my favorite gaming experiences."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"It took me 3 attempts over the course of a year before I finally played Trails in the Sky FC for more then the opening tutorial dungeon. Now, I've played the entire franchise and am a giant Kiseki Nut."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Dropped Bloodborne twice. Eventually stumbled up a couple of fan trailers/music videos that got me hyped enough to give it a third try alongside a friend. We went through it seven times together, each time trying a different build. Definitely sits in my top 15 games of all time, and probably somewhere in my top 10."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Dark souls 2

I tried 4 times over the course of a year

It's a good game it just feels awkward and is hard to start if you have a lot of experience with the rest of the games

I started with elden ring I have 1400 hours in it now

I love dark souls 1

But ds2 is just hard to figure out where to go and a couple of times I figured out I just wasn't having fun"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I played most of little nightmares 2  through, and dropped it for about a month. When I got back on, I walked down a little hallway, boom credits. It was a let down to say the least"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Horizon Zero Dawn, tried about 3 times before getting into it"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Path of Exile. I think it took me until my 4th try to make it to the end game. I am a parent of two young kids, so I prefer to play games that don't require 5 spreadsheets and 4 browser tabs to play efficiently at this point."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"took 3 different tries to finally play Persona 3. I loved 4,  so I tried 3 and kept losing interest. Its still not my favorite but now I've played FES, P3P and just got Reload, so I can say I do like it lol"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I'm not sure if I ever had a game I did multiple tries until I liked it. If I don't like a game I just don't play it and go do something else
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I’ve tried RE7 twice now.

Once when it came out and once this year. Got stuck in the boiler room with no ammo :("
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I stopped playing Disco Elysium for a bit when I couldn't for the life of me figured out how to leave the starting hotel room. Finally got to try it again recently, got myself out of the room a year after getting stuck and I was floored by how great the game is right now."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"The Witcher 3, and boy was I wrong. Top 10 for sure. I struggled getting past the initial combat - didn't care for it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Witcher 3, 3 times, just because there was a tremendous amount of things to understand, and i could not get the hang of it. Then the next time, I stuck with it for 10 hours, and now I'd say it's my favourite open world game ever, with more than 800 hours spent across 4 playthroughs."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Vagrant Story - 3 times.

Please don't put in ""necessary to progress"" block puzzles in an RPG.

Had to wait till I got internet and Gamefaqs to tell me what to do in the later half of the game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,First tried Warframe in 2018 Kept quitting it cause i apparently never upgraded a mod and didnt even have good ones so i kept hitting damage locks
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I have restarted balderas gate 3 like 10 times and always around the time you see the green people riding the dragons. Idk why tho I just want to restart with different mods and stuff
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Took me five starts to kingdom come deliverance to fall in love.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Generally if I drop a game more than 2 or 3 times, I'm never playing it again."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"A few instance, and it""s usually games that are non conventional. 

1) The World Ends with You, had to start 3 times over a 2 years span until it finally click (played back on the DS)

2) more recently, Disco Elysium. I was overwelmed with all the skills/voices.

funny enough, both became one of my favorite games of all time"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I know there are games like this for me but I just cant think of them now, and its driving me crazy!

Anyone is the same as me?

For real, I know there are games like this, and I tried to think, to browse my steam game list and other game list but have zero clue or thoughts! But I knew it, I knew there is a game or some games that I dropped several times before I can enjoy them"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I dropped dark souls 4 times before it clicked and now I've played and beaten every fromsoft game from DS1 and on, except bloodborne."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Days gone. I like the game but after a while it feels like a chore. I pause and some random reddit post on game takes me back for few more mission before I pause once again 

Final fantasy X - I am liking the story so far buy at times a boss just decimates my crew and I give up for few months before looking at guide to beat it"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I think it took me 4 times over like 5 or so years to go past the undead berg in Dark souls. Nowadays I actively seek out souls-like games and have beaten every Fromsoft souls game at least 3 times.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Started Sekiro 3 times before i got my shit together and now it's in my top games ever played.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I had the very smae problem with the first Mass Effect. I dont know hooooow many times i played the intro scene and always said to myself, well no. This just isnt it. Partly because my Pc had trouble running it at the time, partly because i just didnt get into the mood of it. 

After restarting it 4-5 times over 2 years i forced myself to give it a good 2-3 hours. I really got the hang of it and played all games in the series back to back and really enjoyed all of them."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I drop a game within 30 minutes one time. It was ""Green Hell"", because my character die just from a fall from knee height."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I tried to play Ark Survival Evolved with some friends like 12 times. I'd give it a try every several months. Didn't click with me until Survival Ascended came out. Finally played and made actual significant progress. It's a cool game.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Skyrim, couldn't make myself to play it even if my life depended on it. Then I got in a street fight, got kneed in the ribs and couldn't get up from bed properly. Turns out it's not a bad game at all."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Bioshock took me like 6-7 years and two different platforms, but once it clicked, it really clicked. Love that franchise now. The gameplay was just a bit weird to get into."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Breath of the Wild. Half a year maybe, and 3 tries. The Tutorial area was quite large, and once you're ready to explore, it's daunting figuring out where to go next. Climbing the towers was challenging early on in the game. Reaching the dungeons was also very difficult. Not completing them. Completing a dungeon/shrine is easy enough. It's getting to them that was the challenge. 

It took a few tries before I started to like it. When I completed a few Shrines, I started getting better, getting more upgrades, better weapons, more weapon space, and learning how to play the game and enjoy it. Once I reached certain points of the story, I was having so much fun that I found it difficult to put the controller down."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Tried guild wars 2 about 5 times before it clicked. Still not remotely my favorite but I spent over a full month playing 6+ hours a day on that 5th go.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I'm still waiting for this moment with dark souls 1,"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Much more often recently. If the game is not at least somewhat fun in the first 2 hours > drop. I ain't waisting more of my time on a poorly designed experience.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Disco Elysium. I open the game play 15min and close it even tho I like it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Dropped Dota 2 about 4-5 times. Now I like it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Souslborne games: took me 4 different attempts. Finally clicked with bloodborne. Now my all time favourite game series
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,yes I played Fallout 3 and New Vegas did not like it but I watched the Fallout TV shows and l played the games I loved the game
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I cant remember how many times I’ve dropped league fo legends and come back to it like a toxic ex
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I dropped Final Fantasy XV for a bit before picking it back up a few months later and powering through.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,The Last of Us back on ps3. Didn’t like the whole crafting system as it was completely new to me. And I was taking things extremely slow so I eventually just gave up. Tried again on ps4 and boy did I regret not finishing it the first time.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"It took me several attempts to get into Diablo, but now I'm hooked."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Red Dead Redemption 2. I got it on PS4 back in 2020 having not known much about it but liking the first one. Not only was my Internet horrendous so it took 3 full days to download, but I just really couldn't get into it's style for a while. It got shelved until early this year. I would normally get on to mess with the cheats and explore and then not touch it, but this time I did a couple missions and found myself actually charmed by the environment and characters.

Now I affectionately put a little twang in my voice whenever I say the word 'money'. IYKYK"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Hollow knight , 

play it > get lost > drop it. This continued for years before eventually i forced myself to play it. Best choice i have ever made in my gaming life ever 🔥🔥"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"The Witcher 3. 

I played through the intro section of the game 3 times before it finally stuck and I finished the game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I didn't drop it but I was heavily annoyed when I got to Act 2 on the game Inscyption. I loved Act 1 so much so the huge difference in Act 2 really put me off and I was just annoyed the whole time.

However, when I played the game a second time, now that I knew what to expect, I enjoyed it. Now I love the game fully, especially when I can use Act 2 to make Ouroboros OP af. Lol"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Othercide took me dropping it at least 3 times to pick it up and finally 'click'.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I can't think of a game because if I drop a game it's usually dead in the water for me. Likewise, if I like a game I'll usually stick with it until my ADHD kicks in other than hyper focus and pulls me in another direction. Lol"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"not exactly same but similiar problem I have when I like a game, I'm unable to finish it, cuz I don't want it to end. I played VA-11 Hall-A like this. But with dropping games I have expirence too, dropped BG3, Divinity original sin 2 and Subnautica way too many times."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Can't drop mine, they're digital."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Most recently Elden Ring. I've had it for a year or less, never played a souls game before but I knew it would be hard and a learning curve for me.

After dying over and over, and only staying in one area I put it down. Picked it up a few times, touched something that sent me across the map, died, got lost. It was honestly hopeless and I gave up.

Two weeks ago I was playing and my brother gave me some tips, helped me take down a boss to open up the map some more. And bam! It's all I want to play now. I think I've officially put 24hrs worth in."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,"Baldurs gate 3, tried many times dropped many times, currently in act 3 on a playthrough with my girlfriend and only liking it because I'm hanging out with her."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,Seems like Stockholm syndrome lol 
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,Witcher 3. Took 4 tries over a few years to get past White Orchard. Have played the full game and DLC twice so far. Great game once you get past the janky controls.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,Rdr2 still i'm at the beggining
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,I know i’m going to get raked over the coals for this but Persona 5. I always quit around dungeon 3-4. Came back last June and played it until September and finally beat it along with the Royal expansion. Was a blast!
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-15,I’ve been juggling borderlands 3 since it’s release. Maybe this is the year it will be finished
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-18,Assassins creed origins. I dropped that game twice and when I started it the 3rd time it became one of my top 3 games of all time.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"it took me years to understand why people like elder scrolls, it was mostly user error and not really understand what the game was. But, once I figured it out. I marathoned the fuck out of oblivion. I'd say, about 5 years off and on trying from high school to College"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Elden ring I made 3 different characters before I actually finished it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Honestly, what got me into it is to stop focusing on doing the missions and shit and just wandering around the world and doing random crap. I legitimately was bored as hell until I just decided to ride around to collect the towns to make Fast Traveling faster...and just got completely immersed doing that and coming across random events. Once I started getting immersed, it made the story more interesting because I was now enjoying the world."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I am on 15+. Over 110 hours just in restarts. I'll play it for a while and then drop it. Plus, I have OCD and if a game doesn't ""feel"" right, I'll restart. World's most useless tendancy."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Hold A to follow
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,i dropped RDR2 bc my controller has a couple buttons that stopped working and am too poor to buy another controller for the time being
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,The game is more fun to think about than actually play if I'm honest.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Yep same with me. Tried it about 5 times across console and PC. I just don’t like playing it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"First 3 hours are boring and slow, once you past that, it's one of the best games. You really need to keep going."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I’ve tried it a bunch as well. Just never hooked me.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Same. Restarted about 3 times. It’s such a hassle to finish the first part in the ice! Plus playing it on 30fps in the ps5 does not help my case at all. I can’t seem to invest more than an hour into it. It’s too slow for my taste.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"It's absolutely crazy how much of a slog, bogged down by annoying little ""sim"" details, and full of needlessly long animations this game is compared to the original. It's practically night and day. I just can't get into it. It's not automatically more fun or immersive for everything to take forever and be super arduous, no matter what people say."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,You have to get to St. Denis. At that point the game exploded in quality for me. I kept going through to Rhodes and would get bored but seriously after Rhodes the story becomes phenomenal.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I loved game the day i started it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Haha, I was about to write the same."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"bro , i havent gotten past the first small city you get too after the snow part at the start lol, i find it so tidius and boring, the 30 FPS doesnt help , the saving only after missions either, and also i feel like i am trying to guide a drunk arthur around with the janky movements , i dont know its hard for me to get into it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I finished RDR2 just so I can reply to comments like this.

For some people the game is a masterpiece, but for me it was a slog. The dissonance between the me and Arthur was so large the story had no impact and the way they limit you on missions makes it feel on rails. And the camp is so slow investing in side characters is a chore.

If you loved it I envy you, I really do. So much work went into that game but for me it was painful, and I only finished it so no one could say it pays off if I keep playing. For me it doesn't."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Yeah took me 4 tries too. I got chapter 4 on my 3rd try and dropped it. 

Starting up again at chapter 4 helped. I normally restart and get bogged down in the early chapters. 

My advice is to not restart. Just start from where you left off next time.

When I finished the game I was able to say I enjoyed it but not to the same extent as rdr1 or the gta series."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-17,"Dropped it so many times 

First off it’s ass on Xbox one. 

On pc it’s fine but it takes a long time to get things done lmao"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I've restarted w3 at least 3 times, and I can't get more than an hour into it. Each time I shut it down, I fail to start it back up.

Which makes 0 sense to me because I feel like it's exactly the kind of game I'm looking to play all the time."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Nah Witcher 3 is always at the top of posts like this. The controls are honestly quite bad. 
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I dropped it for months after playing a handful of hours on release day. When I picked it back up, I spent my next 200 hours of gaming there. Fantastic game and I'm excited to make my way back around to it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The 4th time I picked it up, I set the difficulty to the easiest so the combat wasn’t a miserable chore and I could mainly get story and exploration out of it"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Tried it twice, just couldn't get into it. No doubt I'll try again.


I wanted to start from Witcher 1 since I have all 3. Man, that was rough. I really did try to have patience but that game felt very dated."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Dropped this game thousands times. Had it on my old ps4  when i was a kiddo, and like two mouths ago i thought that this decision was a mistake, and i bought it in steam with huge discount. Still don't like it. Controlls feel so weard and uncomfortable for me . Gonna pass , there's a lot of better choices"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,It took me 4 attempts with Witcher 3. I really disliked that opening area.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I bought it. Took me 3 years to finally pick it up and then I became obsessed with it. It’s crazy how that works huh?
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Same for me. 

I hate fighting games like this where I have to control the camera as well as the fight. Too used to Souls format."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Bought it at release for PS4, never really got into it until I picked it up for Switch. Now I’ve got three or four completions."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,How many times? I tried it 2 times and it didn’t work for me.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Not that wild of a take, the genre, the gameplay and the story all seem appealing to me, yet tried multiple times, multiple hours but the damn game just won’t click with me or something"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Yeah I finally got it to click after 4 tries
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I started and dropped Witcher 1 and 2 multiple times but eventually it clicked and I played all of them in one go. W2 i just played twice because different stories
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Absolutely not a wild take. Actually one of the most common.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Witcher 3 took me a few times to actually play through the entire game. Would get like 8 to 12 hours in, and move on to something else."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"The opening area is very slow. I had to make a concerted effort to finish that opening quest to get to the real open works, then I was hooked."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I managed to get to the second map, Skellige? On my first playthrough, and then just slowly stopped playing not much later. Still unsure if I want to finish it, and if yes, if I should restart"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I noped out after the intro where you’re in the room with Yen and trying to find stuff around the room. The controls were so frustrating. Then I went back during the pandemic and beat it and both DLCs to completion. It was definitely a crazy turnaround for me.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,Same here. I only recently beat it after years of trying to get into it
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-15,"It was for me for awhile until I reached the next place. The first part of the game is nothing like the rest. After playing the rest of the game, I think it's supposed to be sort of like the tutorial stage?"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Amazing world and story, empty gameplay"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"100% this. The souls games are a nightmare to get into until they ""click"" with you.

I spent a good hour going at the graveyard thinking that's just how the game was. My 2nd or 3rd try, I finally found the way you're meant to go, and couldn't get past the one boss. Probably gave it 5 or so tries and just couldn't get into it.

It wasn't until I played elden ring that the souls games finally ""clicked"" and funnily enough, DS1 is my favorite game."

1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Its reputation really did that to a lot of people. Any other game and people would have probably figured out pretty quickly you’re not supposed to go there yet.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,What's a onebro run? I could google it but feels like it would be cool to hear your story here.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Same, struggled to find some parts early game and I was just getting more and more frustrated when I would get another piece of Titanium or my 6th Lead chunk when I really needed some Copper and Silver for electronics.

3rd time I tried it and had a much smoother time of it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I wish I could erase that game from my mind so I could play it again for the first time
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,This one I want to play so so bad but I keep dropping it after 30 minutes
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Yea, it's a gem. Getting used to the big bads takes some nerves though, the 5th or 6th time I finally cleared it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Same, took about 3 tries but I eventually got hooked and beat it. What an experience."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"If you think of it as an open world game 1st that just happens to look like a Zelda game... that might help. I find it is not the Zelda style I like, so I was turned off a little at first. But then it grew on me after just focusing on the missions and fun stuff"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"the game itself is even more complicated, i swear not even elden ring had me google shit up just to progress like bg 3 did"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Man. I tried so many times since it’s been so acclaimed. But just cannot get into it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Same. I want to love it. Huge strategy player. Love xcom. Love DnD. Cant get into BG3. I cant even tell you why. Too overwhelming maybe?
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Look up mods, they are a bunch that change the UI make it feel more like a 3rd person adventure. Makes the game play quite differently."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I have no idea what platform you're on but I found mouse & keyboard UI a lot better than controller
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Similar. I thought the game was alright but when I reached the point when Sylens was introduced I was hooked, plus by then I was finally clicking with the combat."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I have that with Dragon Dogma aswell, it's an interesting game but I get fed up with the constant dying and just feel lost. Hope to try and get through it at some point."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"""You also have to use everything in your inventory to give yourself an edge - potions, bombs, signs, blade oils.""

This is the biggest turnoff ever for me. I will never try that game again."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,What point in the citadel did it click and get good? I just got done exposing that one dude and I have no motivation to keep playing.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I really liked everything about the game but thought the combat was a bit janky. I think I restarted the game once and finally got used to the combat. The 2nd feels much better in combat.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,This. Mass Effect was so boring to me and it took me til years after Mass Effect 3 came out before I finally went back to give it another chance and ended up playing through the series.  I don't normally like RPGs but once it got it's hooks in I couldn't stop.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"My problem with BG3 is restarting over and over, I like the game but I get the itch to start again, I've been in act 3 twice and still not finished it"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Nothing like a kind and experienced player to help out in path of exile. I had a similar experience. Now I try to return the favor. I like to teach people how to craft the items they buy from me.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Took me a handful of tries over what must be 5/6 years. It finally took at the end of crucible. I started to get league start videos on YouTube and decided to watch a few. Holy hell I got obsessed. I was consuming so many freaking guides bc there was just soooooo much content. I got two voidstones that league but then went absolutely ham during necropolis. Still only 500 hours but sheeesh, what a wild ride"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I’ve tried 3 times never made it more than 3 hours, I know weak effort, but sa la vie.

On another note Kingdom come: deliverance ‘s learning curve had me start and restart about 5 times before I finally made any real progress. It has since become a top 10 maybe 5 game for me."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I tried playing it 3 times before but never got past the part >!""atlas"" family blew up!<. Then  last month purchasing the remastered editions. Finished it yesterday and it's just a masterpiece!"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I played the 2nd one last month. Got to a spot I was kinda confused on where to go. Spent like 2 hours looking in every corner. Got bored enough to kill the last big daddy, but lost the fight.

Save reloaded, all 2 hours lost... I know it was designed with consoles in mind, but a single checkpoint only system and not a save system based on time? Or even like multiple checkpoints in an area? Ugh. I was having fun til that point too."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Yeah I think I started the game like 3 times before I finally made a class that I liked.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Yep, someday..."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Fr fuck that world. I've beat KH1 a few times over the multiple releases and I STILL get lost in that world. It's the same as the water whale dungeon in Legend of Zelda OoT so save princess Ruto. I get so damn lost despite all my playthroughs.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,">I still kind of have a love/hate relationship with it.

I feel like this describes most Bethesda game's well."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"That's one of most favourite games ever, once you realise you can just do a bit of adventure mode to level up things get easier.

I remember my first play through where I got to the final boss but it was ridiculously hard compared to every previous boss. Did a few adventure runs, levelled up and smashed him first try."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I probably tried Arkham Knight 3 or 4 times and still quit in about 2 hours because how much I hate the tank mode BS.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Not being a smart ass, mood stabilizers can help with that. I was the same way prior. 

Or if you can't afford to go to a psychiatrist or don't like doing medication, some dank weed."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Scrolled way too far to find this.

Yeah the first few hours of Bloodborne are rough, it feels almost impossible but slowly you get it and then you're hooked."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Besides LN and Limbo, out of the ones I've played, there's Deadlight and Never Alone. Somerville was created by one of the co-founders of the studio behind Limbo and Inside, but I haven't played it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I feel like that's understandable. It was much different from Re7. The basement in Re7 freaked me out. Lmao I love Village, it's so much fun just to go around killing everything in your path. I've beat that game like 10+ times on all difficulties."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"The guy who did FFT did BoF5? Oh shit, I need to listen to that OST. I am IN LOVE with the FFT soundtrack. It is SO good."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I dropped the first Assassin's Creed cause the tutorial was too long. I just wanted to play the game, I'll figure it out on my own. Lmao"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Yeah I've played it like 3 times total and my last playthrough was like 300 or 400+ hours.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,That’s the best part of this game.  Just checking shit out
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I kept getting bounty’s and getting hunted by bounty hunter because I just couldn’t stop killing everyone.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I loved the first game so much, but really can't get into the sequel. It's not even the game itself that bothers me, just the controls. Something feels off to me, never made it much farther than the the prologue, despite giving it at least half a dozen tries."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Lol I have the same problem. It extends to books and movies as well. It's like I *need* to be absorbing all that the game has to offer in a specific way (the specifics being impossible to define) or I feel like I've missed something. I try to tough it out and push forward, but it almost never works. I'll be too caught up thinking about the past, that I can't enjoy the present. 

OCD is whack (to put it lightly)."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The way Arthur controls is what kills me, it just feels messy to move him around"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Then replay the first 3 hours again to appreciate them more.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Got 10 hours in myself and still wasn’t having fun.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,That's sad. It's probably in my top 3 favorite games ever. But hey people have different tastes it's ok.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Same. Three attempts. Probably 2 hours each time. Just doesn't do it for me. Part of it is I hate walking somewhere close to where I'm supposed to be and it's like ""lol you're level 6 and this thing is level 14 get dunked on and remember to come back in 7 hours, but if you come back in 12 hours it'll be so easy it's not fun"". If you're gonna have leveled areas, do like fallout and have them be gradual and based on distance to the starting area or something. But random pockets where enemy levels wildly vary from minute to minute? No thanks"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,[removed]
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Yup, i almost quit because of the combat. Glad i didnt tho, because its one of the best games i've played."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,True but the story and the world building does take the heavy lifting for the most part
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Weren't they worse originally? The first time I tried it, the controls felt very sluggish and unresponsive, but soon after they released a major patch that added a new control style you could choose from the options menu, and it made a big difference."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The game plays pretty bad overall. I remember playing monster hunter in high school and a friend recommended me Witcher 3 since he said that the fights were more interesting / better. To me the controls just feel like assassins creed odyssey, just boring spins and weightlessness."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Witcher 1 is extremely rough Euro Jank. Theres a reason they are re-making it.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Same here, except that I finished a single run of DS1 beforehand but the souls games didn’t click with me until Elden Ring."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The hunters are player filters. They have seemingly infinite stamina, way more health, and can parry you. 

The first time I reached the turret hunter, he was one hit from killing me and he back stepped off the ledge. Needless to say Bloodborne is my favorite Fromsoft game."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"That's it, exactly. I was watching a video last night that suggested that the Tree Sentinel in Elden Ring serves the function of informing new players that they have to figure out for themselves what they can and can't handle, right from the start."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I picked up dark souls completely blind back in the day. I also had a rough time and went to the graveyard first before putting it down and starting over again a few months later. I don’t think reputation had much to do with it. 

I eventually got the grasp of it when I noticed that tiny staircase that led to the undead burg that I had missed in my first play through."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"You start the game as a level 1 pyromancer (the only class that starts at level 1) and you complete the game without ever leveling up. Other kinds of upgrades are fair game, but your low stats mean that you can use limited equipment, and your low health pool means that the margin for error is greatly reduced. It really breathes new life into the game. Highly recommended."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I started Subnautica for the 1st time not long ago and dropped it for that exact reason, couldn't find what I was looking for just stuff I didn't need curious to know what changed that 3rd time you tried it."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"For real. It didn't feel like a Zelda game for me until the first Divine Beast, like 20 hours in. But as soon as that hit, I was all in."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"My friend was a but of a godsend on that front, he just told me to explore and keep every item that I found then before I went into act 2 he had me stream my game and we went through every character, re specced them and equipped them with what I had.

Suddenly the game became a walk in the park because he's a DnD guy and he knew way more about the stats and gear than I do."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Same. My first two attempts at BG3 were on PS5 and I just couldn't handle it. I would gain so many new spells and abilities, only for them to be lost somewhere in the menus for me to forget about. 

I *love* the little hot bar (if that's what it is called) on PC. Being able to glance down and see all of your abilities makes combat way more engaging. I feel like I'm *actually* making use of all that my individual squad members have to offer."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I played through DD twice. Once to romance that witch girl who lived in the forest and once for the princess.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I don't think it ever did. I just pushed through one time and that was it. Once you start getting the crew together and going to different planets it feels better.

If you get to the mako gameplay on the random planets you might hit a speed bump again, but weirdly I didn't mind it.

If you can, push through because ME2 is one of the greatest games of all time."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Yes! The combat in 2&3 is much better but I wish they'd have such with the overheating for ammo instead of moving to ammo drops. Just a nitpick though.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Yup! This is basically the experience I'm seeing from everyone.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I get all bunched up and then put it away for long enough that I have to do a restart to relearn the game. I get a little further each time. So far, I’ve done this six or seven times."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Nice. Yeah I'm currently stuck on one of the final bosses so I went to adventure mode and damn they really load you up when you do those maps.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Oh thanks bro! I'm able to keep things under control (until next time lmao)

Medication really helped and just gave up on fixating on unresolved shit."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"It's a very similar vibe, a little more industrial to fit the theme of the game but still lots of the same elements."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"In rdr2 if something looks interesting. It is. 

Chimney rock? Try climbing to the top. Abandoned shack in the woods, go look inside. Etc. Etc."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Yea, I had a little of that when first starting. Modifying the aiming sensitivity helped with the aiming, but the physics based movement definitely had a ""clumsily moving in sand"" quality. It is much better on PC at 60, but thats still not something consoles can do."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I am glad and also sad that it's not just me. That is exactly the feeling I have. That I've done something ""incorrectly"" or have missed some key thing or feeling about the game. Even if the game is going really well, I may have the thought to restart. Once I think it, it rattles around in my head until I do it. 

That really sucks about the books and movies. I am good about those. I think movies are too short and books are a more significant time investment than games. OCD truly is whack."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"SAME BRO, plus the 30 FPS just kills it for me"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I gave up at around 40 hours. I loved RDR back in the day but the gameplay didn't evolve enough for part 2 and i just cant with the ancient creaky GTA mission structure anymore.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Yeah, then you just don’t like the game"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Same.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Mine too, what an incredible story and game. Never liked the main GTA games but loved RDR2."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"There is an option in the settings to scale up enemies based on your level, so all content keeps some level of challenge if thats something you want to try. This setting doesn't downscale AFAIK, so you do still have to come back later if your level is to low"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"The combat is bad, and the RPG portion of the game is atrocious. 

The stories are good though, and the quests. Personally dislikes the style of everything as well though, so I couldn't get into it despite trying like 6 times over 80 hours. 

Kept telling myself that many people can't be wrong. But yes, they can.

Opinions be opinion, you can like something despite flaws, but it really hasn't been all that long since that game's (many) shortcomings were OK to acknowledge. It had the blind praise BG3 had/has."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"I didn't realise how bad the combat was until I played it immediately after a long session of Dark Souls 3. It broadly feels like the same kind of system with block/parry/dodge however it feels so floaty and delayed in comparison, it's extremely sluggish and without those cool slo mo executions it would probably be even more awful."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Yeah the Tree Sentinel does a pretty good job of that. You’ve just been told you need to go to Stormveil (which you can see prominently in the distance), and the sentinel, while in your way, is in a big open area so it’s easy to see you can just go around it.

In Dark Souls 1 you’re just told to find two bells and the graveyard is a pretty obvious path, possibly even more so than the one you’re supposed to take."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Oh wow that sounds amazing. Thank you for the details. I don't think I have nearly the skill but I might look up a vid to see how it looks!
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Just got lucky I guess. I didn't struggle as much to find Seamoth parts and was able to find a cave that gave a lot of Silver and Copper.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,I didn't even know romance was a thing in that game I've gotten to the first big city did abit around it then drop it out if frustation.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,I then ended up playing like 40 hours of Mass Effect Andromeda trying to recapture that magic but it just wasn't there...
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"If you get the Enigma sidearm the game becomes trivial in places, you hardly need to aim and you take out multiple enemies at once."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-11-04,"Medication for me has been a blessing, as has therapy. Thought for so long I had anger issues, just turned out it's always been bipolar type 3 (Cyclothymia). I can still get pissed (cause anger is natural ) but it's calmed me to the point where I know when it's coming and it's time to get off the game. Lmao"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-11-04,Def gonna have to check it out.
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,Guy invites you into his little cabin for free food? Don’t mind if I do
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Trust me, even with an unlocked framerate on pc, he still feels like he's walking in cement."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I think for me (I dislike Witcher and bg3 is okay) the main issue is that both games are way too easy, even on the hardest difficulty "
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I agree with your sentiments for both Witcher 3 and bg3 tbh, I’ve hit act 3 on bg3 multiple times and just can’t be bothered to finish it. Act 3 is such a slog it loses all momentum and fun for me"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"I didn't even see the right-side path my first time.. It just blended in with the cliff. Hell I found the secret chest area before I found that path...

Definitely think they could have made it just a *little bit* more obvious."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,Well I did liked the game so I'll def keep trying
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Dragon's Dogma's romance is hilarious. What a weird system. The upside is that I got to give my college roommate unending ribbing since he played my version of the game and somehow managed to get Symone as his ""beloved."""
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"Which is a shame because I thought the combat in Andromeda was so good, but I just couldn't get attached to the story or characters."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"Funny story, another redditor recommended that gun so i looked it up in the wiki and went to go get it. The cipher rod needed to craft it was not there. I thought, maybe I picked it up in the chaos? Looked through my inventory. Nothing. So I looked at a video to see if I was really in the right spot, and yeah, the item is not there for me. Looked it up and I guess it's a known bug that some items aren't there. I also encountered other locations that were odd because it looked like items should be there and it was completely empty, so I figured I was just missing a secret or two. As far as I know, the only way to get the cipher rod is to reroll the campaign since the Labyrinth can't be an adventure map."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,🤨
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-13,"yea the controls are janky as fuck , shit is ass, maybe when it first came out i would have played it but now with the current games and shit is hard"
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,"First playthrough I didn’t bother with the crafting or potions, so the combat was somewhat challenging. If you play the game properly, it’s a breeze."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-12,"That's rough, it wouldn't be so bad if it was something you could pick up outside of the campaign.

I rerolled adventure so many times so I could get to the Postulants Parlour and claim the Fae Royal armour set that I was convinced it was bugged, the real headache is you need to play through to see if it even spawned
in the world as you just don't know. Got there eventually though."
1ff7z8m,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,"Yeah I went for an alchemy build off rip to really rp a Witcher.


Little did I know I'd be literally invisible from level 10+ (I don't remember the level exactly it's been years)"
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-23,"One of those games that has my money before it even releases. My wife loves watching this game, and it's one of the few we can both do together ☺️"

15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,"Not sure about the co-op support. I'm usually for it, but one of the cool things about the last game was how independent the other character was. You didn't have to hold their hands and would even save you during some of the chases. Obviously it's pretty much all scripted, but I don't really see them being able to do the same with a co-op partner, or even an AI character that has to be joinable at any time."
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,"Eyoooo! I am so hyped for this. I loved the first, liked the second, and I hope the new devs do this justice."
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,so the journey didn't end??
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,Is it going to be co-op only?
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-23,Same but looks really good. Bit sad that the old characters aren't returning but hopeful for a shocker at the end like the other two games. Hopefully it's as good as it looks and maybe have more games that tie the characters together. Especially considering what happened at the end of Little Nightmares II.
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,"I'm hoping for both - either AI if you want to play alone - or co-op if you want to play with a friend.

I hope they looked at It Takes Two for inspiration of co-op though obviously not split screen."
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,It looks like it might have co-op too! The visuals look amazing and I'm glad the big people from the first game are back.
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,I hope the series continues. The first sequel was amazing!
15zefwd,2023-08-23,2023-08-24,No idea but probably not.

17j9zvv,2023-10-29,2023-10-30,"YES, I really want this game. I hope it's as good as the previous games developed by Tarsier Studio."
17j9zvv,2023-10-29,2023-10-30,Yeah the company making the game is competent. Until Dawn was a straight up masterpiece. Plus it looks like Tarsier’s template and universe are being respected. I worship the first two games I think the first one with its DLC added on is the better of the two.

Picture this, you’re just getting home, after a long day of being a mouthy npc, when, all of a sudden, there’s this racket outside. You peek out the window and see the Protagonist (doesn’t matter which one, use your imagination) and he’s up to the same old bullshit, causing mayhem everywhere he goes. But, what’s this? Does he have a jetpack? And what’s that?! Is-is that a rocket launcher?!? That’s when the swat team comes in, trying to gun this psychopath down, but he just won’t die, it’s like his health keeps getting topped off! Finally, they manage to either kill or subdue him, it’s finally over. Or so you thought. There’s noise outside, prompting you to look out. There he is. “Ah, shit, here we go again,” indeed."

Imagine you´re forced to move at a constant rate for millions and millions of lives, with no way to stop, redirect, etc. it.

couple that with the fact that there will be stones on the ground and that a quarter of your skin is being grinded down by the ground...

and you´ve got yourself a torture method and a half.

Unless you´re born into timeless or emptiness by eulernum...

but then your whole body would be distorted and even the slightest movement would tear apart space-time around you. your body could not work properly because blood and air need to flow in all directions, and you´re far past the xpos limit, which is reached quite quickly in real life (due to true constant movement being in steps of planck lengths every planck time, effectively moving at light speed towards a point where light cannot work)

He has to go through unimaginable trials and face indescribable horrors to save all these people, not because he has to, but because he wants to. He cares about them, and he's willing to put his life on the line, again, to save them all, no matter what it takes. And unlike Ocarina of Time where after he does a good deed (like liberating Lon Lon Ranch for example) he gets to see the results of his actions and be content in the knowledge that his suffering was not for nought, in this game there's no such respite. He can do a good deed, but it's a thankless job. He will inevitably have to turn back the clock and erase all his hard work. And imagine the times when he fails. When he's too late to save someone, and they end up dying, or worse. All he can do is restart, and go through that hell once again. And he's just a little kid during all this. Fuck.

And then there's the icing on the cake where you learn in TP about what he ended up as after all this. Goddammit man. Link deserved better. Oh well, atleast he gets a happy ending in his next life..."

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Oh my God Amnesia The Dark Descent. My favourite horror game of all time. For a good reason.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Stardew Valley.

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,sleeping in a cosy underwater base while looking up at all the glowing sea flora and fauna would be so easy
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Just imagine trying to get some shuteye with a plague feral pack nearby. I can’t say I imagine I’d get much sleep either.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Throw in 7 Days to Die too!
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I mean once you're up on that hook in DbD, you can get some pretty stress free shut eye... what else are you going to do? Die? Might as well get a head start lol"

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Majora's mask is arguably worse because of the time limit
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Even in the tower it would be so hard.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Just sleep at the firelink shrine.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Sad but cozy environment
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Just buy a fan??
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I find it so scary how common it is for scrappers to kidnap you and harvest your implants etc and leave you to die. Or if they insert some chip in you or BD you with something bad.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,There’s multiple ways to fall asleep in that game though lmao
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I think it's the demons who would be afraid of sleep
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"you literally sleep in that game with the tent, you sacrifice hunger for sanity"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Yeah except your people literally have to sleep. I just put in 30 days of this and my people slept everyday, just like I would."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I was gunna say the last of us, 

But god damn you are right about it dead space. 

You could theoretically barricade a room and get some sleep. 

But you’d hear the screaming of slaughtered survivors, 

You’d hear them crawling through the vents and walls. 😩"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,The marker going to fuck up your dreams also
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,You just need a drill needle in the eye to go in to a dream state
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I was gonna say Alien Isolation but Dead Space is much better
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,damn! That game was so immersive

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"As a snorer, I'd definitely be dying. 🤣"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,THERE IS A MOVIE
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Even if he cannonically doesn't need to accomplish any basic human needs, it's highly possible that when he's waiting for hell to come back on Earth (and he isn't trapped inside Hell), he has a pretty normal human life. He might not need it, but sleeping in a cozy bed for a night and maybe more would feel incredibly good and he might feel better and more ready to fight through the hordes of demons.

Another character who doesn't need food, Code Talker from MGSV, talks about the benefits of eating even when you don't need to. You should check it out."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,All because of a bunny.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Local man too angry to sleep.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I don't think there is one you can see but I'm betting he has some hidden bed system behind one of the bookshelfs or the weapons wall.

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,When I was in 7th grade I saw Stomp in New York (where they use trash cans and brooms and shit to make music) and passed out hard like 20 minutes in lol.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I went to sleep on an active gun range while in Basic Training. I was 17 lol. 

When I say active, I mean I was laying down between people shooting M16s."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,What about on stage?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,My dad took me to see Yes! When I was 15. I fell asleep… age was not a factor! Lol
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I’m 33 and I think I’ve fallen asleep at the last 5 shows I went to, and they were metal shows. I fell asleep with my ears basically bleeding to mastodon."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,As a roadie I've fallen asleep at nearly every show I work lol
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I was repeatedly falling asleep about 50 feet from the stage at an outdoor festival during smashing pumpkins. I didn’t sleep the night before and the mushrooms were wearing off and my brain just decided it was time to shut itself down.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I fell asleep at a Dr.Hook concert! LOL!
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I know it's not, but this sounds like a fucking threat and it's hilarious."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I fell asleep at a Jimmy Barnes concert in my mid 20's. To be fair, it was an autobiographical type performance where he would tell a story for a bit in between songs, and I was very overworked, but still."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-24,I went to a slipknot concert after working 14 hrs on Black Friday and I definitely fell asleep for a bit.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,We get to see THAT in Dead Space 2 :)
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Until Mr. X glitches through the door.

Nah but that harp music is legitimately very calming and therapeutic."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Never slept so good!
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I’d buy that for a high price!
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Squiggly
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,You mean the normal song of time? The reversed one just slows time down
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"He had to live life in an adult body as a child in ocarina of time, when zelda played the song of time nobody knew what had happened and what horrors link saved them from, then link was put into a child's body as an adult in all of majora's mask, then dies. Poor guy"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Actually, in the SCP lore they set up a containment procedure where a pair of I think death row prisoners has to constantly stare at the creature."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,They don't kill you.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Seriously, yea."

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I wouldn't call it my favorite, but definitely the most terrifying to me lol"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Have you played SOMA?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"And you just cannot have insomnia and not be sleeping past 2. Or is it 1 am? Can't remember, but it doesn't matter, no insomnia sounds pretty sweet."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Oh goodness, absolutely!!"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,That’s facts lol
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Congrats! You've been disqualified from the race ;-)
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Imagine not and wake up to you being destroyed by a hoard
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"True you could sleep at the shrine but, in a real life setting there's no magical mist to keep you from getting attacked while sleeping ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-24,Right? At least we get a nice fire to sit next to.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I had one. I used both
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Oh i misread
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Literally a central plot device is waking up after sleeping
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"But in that game, sleeping gets harder and harder. If I was in DST, I would be too scared to sleep. The second a light source is gone, gg."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-24,"I'd not be able to emotionally distance myself from that level of suffering. There are people who are able to turn it off, and some who simply don't know what doing something like that will do to your mental well-being... and some are sociopaths."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Even worse. 

You'd hear the marker. 

Make us whole"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,You go to sleep a couple times in the game the Last of Us
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Vents?!?!?!? Amogus?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-24,A bit exaggerated but yeah
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I've got sleep apnea. If I don't have my CPAP, you can hear me snoring from the other side of the house."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Its got the rock
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I think there is two? They are both really meh though
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Theres 2, they both suck and I love them"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,My dad has it on blu ray lol
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,The first movie is so bad it's good. Second one is just bad lol
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Don't get your hopes up.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,That doesn't take place on Mars.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Its not very good, dont get your hopes up. The only good part is the very last section of the movie, when it finally remembers its a movie based on a video game."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Shadow Mantis? Patriots? Lalilulelo? Afghanistan?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Don’t they have to wake him up from a deep sleep for Doom 2016 or something?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Local man too angry to shit.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"A few years ago I went on a trip to Iceland. I couldn't sleep the night before my flight, or on the flight either, and as soon as I landed I met some friends and went on an off-road tour without having slept for 36 hours.

I discovered it was possible to fall asleep in a 4x4 bouncing along a riverbed up the side of a volcano."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Correct. The Goldberg Variations is particularly nice to relax people as you have them for dinner.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Where you can, when you can ammirite? Good use of time, promote ahead of peers"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Ah damn, it's been too long since I played that one.... oops"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-24,"Oh yeah you’re right, I just haven’t played Majora’s Mask in a while."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Yeah ik he was an adult in a child's body but that just makes it worse lol. Also Zelda played her lullaby, not the Song of Time."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"That's how they handle it when they're testing it, and you have to say ""blinking"" when you're about to blink, but for some reason the actual containment procedure just has the thing in a room not being watched at all.

There's a short story written where they begin multiplying and it becomes a huge problem because it turns out they're extremely strong. In a matter of hours/days they actually manage to wipe out humanity because of their sheer numbers being impossible to look at them all"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"There's actually another SCP that's a pair of very friendly creatures that don't blink, so they use them to keep 173 controlled when people have to clean out its enclosure."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I'm surprised it's not just enclosed in an aquarium, fish don't have eyelids and enough of them will always have some eyes on or around it"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I mean, yes and no? Sending you back in time an unknown distance is pretty much effectively killing you"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,MW2 was a lot like Trainspotting. You need to worry when you stop hearing the baby...
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,What's your favourite?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-24,I want to buy can't run it lol. I have a GT 710.
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"There is however a magical mist that resurrects you from the dead, as long as you can maintain the willpower to keep going and not turn hollow, so if you're OK with waking up dead once in a while you could really sleep anywhere!"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Tru dat, I also forgot about the invaders."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I remember that scene where Ellie wokes up by that kid she was becoming friends with...>!he was bitten and literally tried eating her in her sleep...!<

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,...Metal Gear?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"To be fair, he was only sleeping because he was trapped inside a sarcophagus by the demons that was designed to keep him asleep. And the demons could only trap him after they knocked him out... by dropping an entire fucking city on him."

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Once when I was passing through Hong Kong and after getting off a red eye (where  I didn’t get much sleep), I immediately went out to enjoy the night life. Drank double shot espresso to stay awake. Shortly after I started dozing off mid conversation in a lounge while sitting on an uncomfortable ottoman-hybrid stool. My friends had a laugh"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Worst I get is hot brass on my face. Gladly take that and get some sleep between shooting runs. 

Learning to sleep anywhere is what the military is good for. Makes you able to be effective no matter the situation."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"Yep, that entire first sequence when you’re in the straight jacket and the station is being overrun is fuckin siiiiiiiick"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I thought that was the containment. Otherwise it’d just break out right?
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Could be that it needs to be a person
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"The difference between killing and ""effectively killing"" is the part where you die."

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,They take a portal to hell and back
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I agree that was a great scene, thou rest of the movie meh."
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,never that
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I slept through the Siege of Baghdad after clearing our assigned air strip. Rangers lead the way!! (The Way is leading, usually, to a meal or rack time)"

16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"It isn't very good at breaking out, it kinda just moves around in it's room, which I think does have a camera but isn't always on because it doesn't need to be. They just lock it in a room, and let it chill in there cuz what's it gonna do"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,I literally couldn't finish SH1 because I just dreaded having to boot that game up lol
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"I took ""if it was real"" to mean ""you're actually in the game universe"". In Dark Souls, the undead can continuously die over and over again because they're undead. You only ""die"" when you lose the will to go on, and you become Hollow. That's what I meant...no need to take it so seriously"
16psr4t,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,Err... I don't think they do if we're talking about the one with the Rock in it...

1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,Any particular reason why you haven't played Horizon Forbidden West? I would recommend that.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,If you've played Alan Wake 1 and Control then play Alan Wake 2. Base game plus DLC plus final draft if you really like it will keep you busy for a while. 
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"The Games I could recommend are not on sale rn, so just in case you still decide for full price or you might find them as PS keys on key-reseller websites a bit cheaper than in the PS store, you can check my list:

Also Prices are shown in Euro, however if you live in US, they're almost similar to Dollars, maybe even 10 Euros more than Dollars. So if you see a Game for 59,- €, it's probably 49,- Dollars, you might have to check that. 

Prices shown from Standard editions. Check out other editions first, they might be on sale what Standards are sometimes not, or a better deal bc they cost slightly more

1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"If you've never played it, Infamous Second Son is backward compatible on PS5 and is a great single-player game with a good story and a cool morality system that influences how your powers function. The photo mode is another great point. You can get some really beautiful shots with it!

I'd also throw in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, if you liked playing through Insomniac's Spiderman games. Although I'm pretty biased when it comes to the R&C series, I can vouch for how fun the gameplay is, and the graphics are eye candy, as well.

Ever want to stop time, teleport, or possess people’s/animal’s bodies? Dishonored has you covered. You can stop a bullet midair, possess someone, and walk them in front of the hanging bullet. You leave the body and resume time and let the bullet do its job. That’s just one example of how creative you can get. Missions are open ended. Play how you want. Different endings based on how many people you kill. You chose whether you want to be a sneaky assassin where no body has any idea you’re out there or a maniac set on killing every living soul, innocent or not. Gotta say the first game wasn’t super clear about your “chaos” level. The bloodier your sword, the more chaos/bad stuff you’ve done. That was your only indication. The second game they made a nice graph per mission showing you how you performed based on how stealthy/chaotic and pacifist/killer you were"

1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Word well thinking of ya buddy, hope you find a great game then!

I’d recommend:
- Skyrim
- baldurs gate 3
- uncharted series
- tomb raider series
- mafia series
- Desperados III
- Xcom Series"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,Same my man. Closely followed by TW3.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,I definitely don’t doubt that at all😂
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,The online mode? Really?
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Easy now, cowboy. People have different preferences."
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,Dam right it will man!!!
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,"Yeah, what about it?"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Keep it up, Boo!"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Nah, The full game is wayyy longer, and it's very charming"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Almost forgot. Try the mafia series.

Mafia: Definitive Edition
Mafia 2 
Mafia 3

A prequel is also releasing this year."
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"It’s amazing and there is an overhaul expansion mod being developed by the top dev on the nexus mods forum. It’ll give the game an end game and overhauls every card.  But ya amazing game :)  every hit feels hard as hell every power is amazing - just do same beautiful. I got a decent pc to play bg3 and mms mods, though bg3 has gotten them to go on console now (the mods)"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,And def need to get dlc chars. Venom is amazing.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"I'm not sure I platinumed it, but I thonk I played all side content, except for the extremely boring ones. It was quite fun, but I don't think it's the type of game I'd pay more than $5 to play tbh. Very good, but not my style"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"I finished the first one, but not the second. Second stay a bit too long.

Maybe try the new astrobot? It won GOTY and you’ll see a lot of characters you know from other games. I think it would be a fun time"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"I haven't played that one. I'm a fan of TCS, and 3

The Indiana Jones titles are also short but decent"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Have you ever played the OG MW? 

If you have an Xbox 360/PC/PS3 

You gotta add Left4 Dead 2,CoD 2 and Bungies Halo games to the list (only on PC and 360 :[ )"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-10,"idk about console performance but if it's a steady 30-45, it's worth it."
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Ah okay.
In that case, my next recommendation is Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana. It's a fast-paced game with smooth combat, with parries and dodges and stuff. And it takes place on a tropical island with dinosaurs. Fun anime style vibes. Amazing soundtrack too."
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"It opens up a lot after a few hours, there are a lot of choices in the story, and the DLC really makes it better. It's kind of like if World of Warcraft and Dragon Age had a baby."
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,Oh gotcha. Yeah I wanted to buy it recently but it wasn’t on the PS5 store for the console but it was still listed on the PS App and on the website. I guess it was delisted on the console due to crashes. Huge bummer bc I loved that game.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Yeah. I couldn't bring myself to replay RDR2 at 30 fps (mostly to not ruin the experience), let alone a game like andromeda. Here's hoping the new mass effect game is as good as the originals (if it even comes out)"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,"Yeah!!! 

It’s got a bit of monotonous grind if you want and all the cool sandbox stuff you expect. 

Honestly , it just fits my life at the moment. 

I have a full time job and two young kids so don’t have the headspace OR time for a monster game. 

I do however have the odd moment to walk around in the desert , shoot cactai and crash a few cars …"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,It's not as bad as the internet wants you to believe. It's legit a chill way to kill some time.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,So it's a 7/10 at best.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,Yes ma'am🫡
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,I couldn't get past that damn car race in MDE lmao. Was liking it til it got to that part
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"I likedthe PS5 demo a lot, so probably will like it too. Tho I heard it' a bit short for the price tag iinm"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Yeah. Don't recommend it. All characters are divided in classes which makes them all feel the same. Literally quantity over quality. SW3, Batman 2, and Marvel 1 prob are my favorites"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"I played MW2 Remastered and loved it (mostly bc of the story and cinematic moments), but not MW1. Maybe when MW3 Remastered comes out we'll get a trilogy?"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,It really reminded me of WOW. Still figuring out if it's my type of game or not tho. Will consider giving it another chance
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,"Yeah, btw just played it on my Series S and indeed it feels so slow now bc it runs there on 30fps as well lol

Well, we probably have to get the Ge on PC to enjoy it in 60fps then, not a Problem for me though, as I already possess all Main systems (Nintendo Switch x2, Series S, PS5 Slim, PC with an 3070, Laptop with an 4060)"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,My sister and her boyfriend are on some kind of roleplay GTA server where they own a bakery. They even have excel spreadsheets recording their employees hours and paychecks lol shit is crazy
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,"Maybe to you, not everyone has to have the same preferences. But the large majority of gamers have rated it over 9.5/10"
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,Play on the easiest difficulty then. I'm planning on beating the game on the hardest difficulty lol
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,Nah I heard that they already made that one but they will bring it out one day when there will be another IW trailer reaction.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,Oh that's wild lol
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,"Popularity is not the same thing as quality. It is objectively a medieval fantasy RPG, no matter how many people think it's a 10/10."
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-07,I'll give it another try in the future. Sometimes you just evolve in gaming after some time. First time I played GOW2018 I could barely beat Sigrun and had to switch to the easiest difficulty. Second time I beat her on my second try on the second hardest difficulty. Maybe the same applies here
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,Are you saying the game is bad just because of it's genre???
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,Yes.
1ik6zjl,2025-02-07,2025-02-08,Wow... 🤦
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,I like it
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,It’s okay. Worth a playthrough at least. After that you kinda always know what to do.
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,Great game
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-22,As someone with a genuine phobia of mannequins/dummies: I hate it with a passion and heartily recommend it.
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,I love this game so much fun and on top of that it’s actually really creepy to me its a lot more scary then most the horror games they put out today
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,Purchased it 2 weeks ago. Saving it for October for spooky games. Liked the first game and excited to start the sequel

psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,Definitely a nightmare than the first one.

psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-22,The atmosphere is incredible but some of the levels are so boring! Or rely on very strange/confusing mechanics that make it frustrating to play.
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-22,"Yeah it’s not very long and some of the late game combat puzzle stuff is a bit tedious, but the exploration/environmental story-telling is awesome, even the mobile game is good and I hate mobile games."
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-22,Exactly like real school!
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-22,Kinda disappointed is isn't scary
psrxjy,2021-09-21,2021-09-22,"Master piece

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

give you scares very good 

&#x200B;

the message behind is awesome

&#x200B;

the character models and animations are amazing (graphics too)

sound design is the best thing in this game

&#x200B;

and most importantly, this is the most real (rather unreal/fictional) indie game that i've played. what i mean is that these 2 games are like red dead redemption quality graphicwise when it comes to small game companies"

Arguably the DLC for *Asura's Wrath*, but that's more because the story was incomplete without it. Scummy move, Capcom, but I still bought it so clearly it worked.

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"I hate endings in games that just go to black essentially. No epilogue, no explanation, no character moment, no anything. By those standards I really liked Valkyria Chronicles, this 20 minute ending scene was glorious. 

I also somehow remember Dead Space 2 ending very fondly somehow. That moment when Isaac just sits there, waiting for his end and the game almost had me convinced that this is actually it. 

Chrono Trigger's ending is really good, I mean one of its 13 endings is really great. It's probably the music too, still. 

Okay, my maybe weirdest memory of a good ending is Dungeon Siege III, because it has a lot of ending slides that are entirely based on the players decisions throughout the game - RPGs often have something like that, but I did not expect to see this here and not in this elaborate way. A welcome surprise."

After everything he did to save the promise of this new world where everyone could be free, his homeland is stolen from his people and when he sees people celebrating the last boats of British people leaving the harbour he looks over and sees the slave trade has gotten its claws into the new world.

The free world he was sold by the Americans in order to get rid of the British and the Templar threat was a total lie."

To this day, he flat out refuses to accept why Kratos made the decision he did or why it was the correct one, and insists that Kratos should've given the power of hope to Athena ""because she's a good guy and would fix the world he ruined with that power"". The fact that she ultimately proved to be just as amoral, narcissistic and manipulative as Zeus (if considerably nicer about it), and was only helping Kratos so she could usurp the throne of Olympus, went clear over his head, and he simply won't let his mind be changed by any argument.

(My buddy's a good guy; he's just really ignorant, has severe anger issues and is too stubborn to admit when he's wrong.)"

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"Tbh I'm not very good with horror games, I find them way scarier than horror movies. But even tho I was shitting my pants, SOMA was the first horror game I actually completed from start to end. That's how good the story is lol."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Imagine going through all that bs just to learn a doggy was causing all that
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,I loved the Joker in Knight. It was a great way to have him in the game and was a huge part of the storyline and Batman's struggle during it.
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"Ditto. Was an amazing game, and I didn't expect to care so much about Parker by the end. I too shed a tear."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"Same,  and I was shook when I accidentally pulled the trigger 😭"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,The cake is a lie
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,BRO GET THE HELL OUT OF THE COMMENTS SO NOBODY SPOILS IT FOR YOU! i would pay anything on earth to be able to replay that game without knowing the ending
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,I think they’re talking about the first RDR

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,CAUSE WE'RE GONNA SHOUT IT LOUD
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"Batmobile. But i don't agree with them. It's just a bit overused, especially for what could have been amazing boss fights. And then the hoops you have to jump through to get the true ending."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Right! Like holy shit that game is just breathtaking
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,I don't mind the cutscenes. It's nowhere near as on your face like kingdom hearts 3 is (also enjoyed that game but the ending was a giant movie)
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,Yes
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"I'd recommend it the campaign is a bit short but I liked it.

It's basically the spiritual successor to New Vegas and a tribute to Firefly in one package."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Yup!
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Not that great but people overreact
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"Just a cheesy side scrolling platformer from the 16bit era. (Which doesn't help much, most games then were side scrolling platformers!)
Here's a link to the ending. Laughable now. Amazing when I was ten!
https://youtu.be/b9ZO7X0GGBs"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,It's a platformer with a great story relating to the Manhattan project. The levels are puzzles playing on different variations of time manipulation mechanics. The art is all hand drawn and phenomenal.
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"The selfie, I guess"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Yeah the story changes in the remake are so bad! The original is perfect in every moment
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"Yes, first game I ever beat."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Make that a three way
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,I still remember big smoke's last words
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,You shoot him in the head
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"Yes, for me its one of the best Stories i have ever played"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,It's an older one. It was one of my favorites as a kid. I need to play through again for the nostalgia hit.
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"It’s on steam for around 20 dollars, worth every last penny"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Definitely
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Wdym

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"Completely worth it, in my opinion, despite all the bugs, glitches, and crashes, I think that New Vegas is the best designed game ever made, it’s not my favorite game, but it’s in the top 5."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,You're lucky to have lots still to experience. Enjoy!!

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,;D
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"I was being ironic and sarcastic, the ending was so bad they had to tac on a new ending that was just as bad like the soprano ending, it just went to a black sceen end of story."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,In the world

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,It actually happens in the second play through. But that’s funny seeing a game which was released 20 years ago did this
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"True. It was also a different take on the character. You can notice him being a bit ""different"" in Knight from Asylum and City and that's because it isn't really the Joker. It's the version of Joker present in Batman's mind. It's how Bruce knew him when he was alive. And there's also some of Bruce's own insecurities present in those hallucinations. The difference was so subtle yet so brilliant and Joker was honestly one of the best things about the third game."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"The sacrifices he makes that might cause sadness to him but peace to others, I just love that game man"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Can someone describe the ending to me?

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Looks good
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Yeah I agree
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Thanks
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Yeah it was that iPhone game right?
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Oh I’ve heard of it and want it but still haven’t played it
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,*smiling trollege face*
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Yeah
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,What ending
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,The thing I hate most is it’s supposed to be the grand finale

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,what does being a marine have to do with spoiling a story? are you saying you will use your skills on someone who spoils it?
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,You can do so ``>!like this!<``.
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,How much does it cost
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,My opinion too
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"Same people that did Fall out New Vegas. OW is a good game. Not a AAA game, more like a A or AA. It should be on sale around Black Friday and it’s worth playing."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,Just dont expect the writing to be anywhere as good.
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,"I got pretty turned off by the very linear world design, and pretty subpar writing. It feels more like an incredible  polished mod using an older game engine than it does a  modern video game."
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"A long time ago, I just couldn’t figure it out today"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,yep
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,We do what we must because we can
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,yes
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-04,Thanks for the help :)
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,It goes on sale quite often. Not sure where you are but it only cost me £12
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Well can’t play console games until Christ birthday because school but I’ll check it out
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Alright
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,"That’s because it is an older game and amazing for the time, not to mention that it was developed in 13 months, of course they would have to cut corners"
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Ok
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Shiver me timbers
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Yeah I can get it thanks

qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Be careful of spoilers
qmnyt1,2021-11-04,2021-11-05,Makes more sense
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Limbo and Inside. I believe they’re both available on switch. Same side-scroller/mini-puzzle concept as Little Nightmares.
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Bump for ""Inside"" and ""Limbo"" and i personally recommend Stela"
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Hollow Knight. Indie game too so I think it's pretty cheap.
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"it's not like little nightmare but it's an indie game, and i think that might be what you liked about these games, that they offered something different than the norm that comes with AAA games.

[Moonlighter](https://youtu.be/S_mW3PSp4IM)"
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,"Never Alone is also a good one! Not sure if it’s on the Switch, but worth a shot to look up."
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"Thank you! I had a look into these a while ago but didn't think much of them. Just had a look into both again and purchased Inside. Im about 40 minutes in and I am absolutely loving it! Thanks for the suggestion :)

*Edit: grammar*"
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,Wow I've never heard of this game. Just googled it and it seems to be exactly what im looking for. Thank you!
102xcio,2023-01-04,2023-01-05,"No worries! It’s a fairly unknown game, but a good one."
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,"Agree, great game."
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,You’re exceptional
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,Yes it is. I really hope they make a third game.
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,[removed]
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,Is the pacing better than the first game?
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,Recently just finished it. Genuinely one of the best games I've played in years.
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,No u.
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,I believe they stated they are done with it.
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,"When I see a dissenting comment that is downvoted but has no comments, my immediate assumption is that ppl just want to circlejerk about a thing they like and don't want any discussion or opinion exchange."
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,What do you mean? The first game didn't have pacing problems
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,Tarsier studios (developers of little nightmares 1 and 2) are moving on to other ips but bandai namco own the rights to little nightmares and have said that they are still looking to work on the series I think.
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-04,[removed]
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,"I remember starting it and being incredibly bored with it by about a half hour in. It started very slowly, just couldn’t get into it at all."
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-04,"The more I used teddit the more I realize people don’t want conversations or discussion, they want echo chambers and circlejerks"
n3sygd,2021-05-03,2021-05-03,It spent chapter 1 building the setting and tension. That's not really bad pacing. Every other chapter had something going on
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-14,Its great but you know six is the vilest charater of little noghtmares 1 & 2
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-14,She evil
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,The little judas (nice sculpture tho)
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,You plan on painting it?
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-13,I thought it was a buttplug from the thumbnail
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-14,"So many gamer relics in the background too, major props."
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-14,I have not played the second one yet but I really hope that wasn't a spoiler
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-14,It is painted
m4hc1u,2021-03-13,2021-03-14,Nice

8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Really nice drawing! 
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,I think I should not be stepping on any creaky floorboards
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Looks like a fucked up Mr Stealy
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Creepy as hell... Which means it's really good!haha
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,"Digging that pen and ink style!
One of the best and most original games of last year."
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,"I've had this on my wishlist for a while. I think I want it to be Limbo which is maybe why I've not bought it.

Nice drawing. "
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Wow
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Great game! Loved the sequence near the end with the fat people
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Really good. I've drawn some of the characters from Little Nightmares myself. Loved drawing them for how different and interesting they are. You've got a good style too
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,never played it but it looks fucking good
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,"I wish I had this kind of talent, this is really, really good. "
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-09,"More people need to play this game, still not quite sure I understand the ending but it was awesome and terrifying and the monster design was really cool and inventive."
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,thanks!
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,Have you played 'INSIDE'? 
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,"Oddly, I watched a play through because I was so skeptical it could be as good. I certainly got that impression so I don't think I'll be buying it. 

Limbo was obscure and vague whereas I found Inside to be just perplexing"
8anvtd,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,I found it to be a great spiritual sequel. Totally did not see that ending coming. 
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,"I've seen a lot of fanart about it and I'm obsessed with it, but Little Nightmares never seemed that interesting to me... is LN2 any different than the first one?"
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,As someone that’s been wanting to play it this picture gives more questions then answers
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,Is it longer than 1st?
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,HELEN!
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,[deleted]
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-14,That face reminds me of Sid from ice age
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,"If you didn't like the first one, I unfortunately can't say that the second is much different in terms of gameplay. It is a LOT scarier and I think it's more immersive. I had to watch a couple of theory-crafting videos to get myself interested (I watched SuperHorrorBro) and now I can't stop thinking about the universe, especially after the second game!"
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-04,Lol treat yourself to those answers in the game! It's so good!
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,"Definitely! First one was like 2 hours, this new one took me about 5 hours"
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,Complete edition has the dlc and the normal one does not
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-15,LOL I hate that I can see it
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,I dont want spoilers but does it build on that crazy ending from 1 or different character?
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,"I would say that having played the first game will make certain moments in the second game more resonant.

Edit to add: but it doesn’t pick up where the first game left off."
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,It kinda explains a lot of stuff but doesn't pick up right after the ending of the first one or anything like that
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,It builds on it in some ways but as the other replies say it doesn’t pick up where it left off and you play as a different character
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,Aww so no geisha powers
lxy0fy,2021-03-04,2021-03-05,"Nope, no Geisha powers unfortunately, but there are plenty of other cool things in the game"
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,That's cute :)
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-15,Man I'm in my 20s and Little Nightmares 1 and 2 still make me shiver. At least your kid was trying lol hopefully they weren't scarred for life
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,"Uh ho. Quick buy the kid a few bags of haribo to get over his emotional scaring before child protective services comes.

I'm sure you know what to do, but maybe play a little with him beside you and make fun of it, emphasise it's just tiny dots on a screen and those dots could just as easily be a picture of peppa pig, so it isn't scary. Even if it was shit ya pants terrifying then that's okay, no shame in being afraid. Hello Neighbour can be scary, but it's childish and silly with it and so we can tell it isn't real. 
You don't want it coming out as twisted drawings at school that calls you into the Headteachers office lol."
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,Ok?
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-15,"Yeah if your going to let your kid okay scary games, it's best to play beside them and tell them it's not real. I saw nightmare on elm Street when I was kid, I had an extremely ironic but reccuring nightmare at least once a week til I turned 11"
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,He was bein so mean to his little bro yesterday about being scared of the trailer too lol
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-15,Haha yah when I was 10 I wouldnt be in the same room as the case for the damn game
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-16,"Oh no hes totally fine it was more just a funny moment. He loves Hello Neighbor, we actually created a game where me and mom play the guy and the kids gotta break into the house!"
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,I added the followup in the text post! Sorry
vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,That's karma :)

vz53im,2022-07-14,2022-07-14,"Great game though! Hes just at the age where he thinks youre supposed to not be scared, when its supposed to be scary and youre supposed to be scared!"

10pz2z4,2023-01-31,2023-01-31,"If she has someone to play with, It Takes Two sounds exactly what she’s looking for in terms of it basically being a picture book.

Pentiment is very artistic too, I can recommend that"
10pz2z4,2023-01-31,2023-01-31,"Maybe not exactly what you’re looking for, but “Inside” comes to mind for me. It’s got a similar art style, and plays very similarly as well."
10pz2z4,2023-01-31,2023-01-31,Limbo is pretty similar to LN more storybook style imo. If she doesnt mind retro. Get the M64 emulator and play Yoshi's Story very fun stoeybook game.

""Integrated intel graphics"" describes a whole lot of different things.  The game [has been run on an Intel HD 4600](https://youtu.be/cZazWXFci0c) but with rather disappointing performance."

4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"I'm some ways I totally agree with Stephen King on this, but the problem is that just because the main characters and the reader shouldn't be given an explanation doesn't mean there shouldn't be one. As the writer you should have a concise idea of what your story is, and it should be internally logical and consistent. You don't need to reveal this to the reader or the characters, but you need to know it yourself while creating the story. Otherwise you have no framework and you end up going off the deep end eventually, and even the readers can tell. That's how a simple story about supernatural clown who kills children in a small town ends with a giant turtle in an inter-dimensional tug-o-war. "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,I just finished re downloading this game like a half hour ago. Been wanting to give it another go
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,Don't forget American Nightmare!

4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,This is why I stopped liking Silent Hill once they tried to explain what was going on (starting with 3). Silent Hill 2 stuck with me more than just about any other game I ever played. 
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"You butchered the quote a bit.  The actual text is:

> Big movies demand big explanations, which are usually tiresome, and big backstories, which are usually cumbersome. If a studio is going to spend $80 or $100 million in hopes of making $300 or $400 million more, they feel a need to shove WHAT IT ALL MEANS down the audience’s throat. Is there a serial killer? Then his mommy didn’t love him (insert flashback). A monster from outer space? Its planet exploded, of course (and the poor misunderstood thing probably needs a juicy Earth woman to make sexy with). **But nightmares exist outside of logic, and there’s little fun to be had in explanations; they’re antithetical to the poetry of fear**.

4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"I think the real news here is that Steven King put an apostrophe-S on the end of ""nightmare"" to pluralize it."
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,I replay it once a year or two. Every time I do it draws me in. 
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"I really need to play it, it's on my to do list. But, ugh. So many other games like Rimworld atm."
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,You basically just described what Lost could have been. They had no idea where they were headed or how the show would end or what the fuck was going on from season to season.

4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,There were a number of teases for Alan Wake 2 in Quantum Break (which was another FANTASTIC game).
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-24,"Not sure about SK story's, but the Alan Wake story did not explain the biggest questions. I don't want to spoil anything here, so I wont go into details. There are a few questions that don't get explained by the end of the game. The spin off game American Nightmare does show the aftermath but still leaves those questions unanswered. It also creates more questions that go unanswered. 

In my opinion, this is what makes this games story so good. It gives the viewer/player the opportunity to create there own explanation. "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"I played silent hill 2 about 4-5 years ago. I'm still trying to figure out what the was going on. lol 

It the only silent hill I have played, but I did watch the movie. Which only made me more confused. "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"If you have never played ""Alan Wake"" This quote in the title of this post is the opening of the game. Please give it a try if your fan(which it seems you are) of SK."

4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"I liked the ending of the show, but that's just my opinion"
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-24,"Yeah, I could tell pretty early on that the show had no internal logic or consistency, and that this was probably intentional from the beginning. But when people see something mysterious they want to unravel the mystery. Trouble is, sometimes there is no mystery, only incoherent nonsense which is unexplained only because it's explainable. A good mystery (of the sort King is talking about) is one which can make sense, but is never explained. "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"It's not as long as the original game, but it does continue the franchise/story, and Mr Scratch is a good villain. Plus it keeps the same gameplay. For £7 I think it's quite good. "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-24,"Yes and no. It keeps the story going but it not a direct sequel, just a spin-off. It better then the dlc, but because it an ""arcade"" style game, you will only get to run around a small town. Collecting things, fighting bad guys and searching for story pieces. "

4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-24,"Keep in mind that Silent Hill 3 came out 4 years after the first game. So until then, we just had two stories of different people who ended up in this weird town. I wish they had kept going that way, with a series of games in which the only thing they had in common was this fucked up, unexplained place. 

Like the OP quote, the series lost me when they went back and tried to explain things. "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-24,Well damn. I'm gonna have to replay the game now. This explanation forces me to look at the game in a different light.
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"I apologize for the grammar. I know Reddit is big on that(for some reason I will never understand). 

I did not realize that the quote ended when it did, until your comment. Unfortunately I can't edit and fix it.

To be honest, the game play can get a lil repetitive. But the story... In my opinion, is one of the best in gaming. Tho I'm sure others would disagree."
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-23,"Even though i love king, i have to agree. I hate how abruptly his stories usually ends. 11/22/63 was one of those times.. Dammit loved the book but the ending fell for me, same with Mr Mercedes "
4u6npp,2016-07-23,2016-07-24,"I think they wanted to make it intentionally ambiguous, which is partially frustrating given how many times they used mystery as a hook for the show that also had pay-off for those mysteries.

For me, I'm glad they didn't go through the ""Battlestar Galactoca"" route where it's very clear none of the writers had any clue how to end the show."
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-07,"Lots of Spoilers below:

>!They don't know they are in a loop. Only mono probably knows it's a loop when he becomes the Hat man because he tries to save his younger self from Six throughout the game. 

>!Not sure where Mono comes from. Pretty sure the game never explains that, just gives you something to wonder about. Just like they don't explain why Six is at the beginning on the game

>!Static Six is I'm pretty sure kinda like the ghost version of Six, because when she and other kids get sucked into the televisions they have static versions of themselves in the world (as seen from the collectible ghost/static kids)

>!It's a Prequel because at the secret ending scene you see Six's stomach rumble (if you played the first game you'll know why that matters) and her static self look to a poster on the floor of the location from the first game. 

>!She betrays Mono because she thinks Mono is basically taking her away from her safe space, at the start of the game you find her with her music box and you take her away leaving the music box behind. Mono also hides under the bed and not attempt to save Six when Hat Man captures her. Then Mono at the end smashes her Music box to pieces. Throughout the game you also see Six becoming less and less innocent too, Contorting the fingers of one of the mannequin hands for example."
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-07,"

What was the only way the cycle could be broken for some reason"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-07,I don't think it can be broken.
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-07,"Ok



What does the TVs and the ppl going out of their way to look at it represents cause all I seen through my playthroughs are those"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-07,"For that I think it's down to user interpretation. What I got out of it is that the big tower you see throughout the game and at the end is behind it all. Some kind of force that twists worlds to their liking and needs a conduit to function/survive, in this case the Hat man and it basically hypnotizes people with the TVs"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"Biggest question 



Is mono and six related 
In the first game she ate EVERYTHING in her path, y couldn’t she do it in the prequel"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"The game never suggested that they are related, so I don't think so. Only at the end of LN2 is Six at the full sinister stage. LN2 basically has her changing personality from innocent to twisted throughout the game as I explained in my first comment.

Perhaps she also lost a lot of herself when she was captured and sucked through the TV, which is where the Hungry mode starts because she manages to escape."

nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"No idea. Probably just an artistic decision to add mystery, works for me."
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"Now for my biggest question ever 





Why don’t mono escape from the empty room where he’s walking towards during the tv entrance"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"You mean when Mono is Hat Man? He can't because he's locked in. Only when younger Mono opens it is when Hat Man can escape

You also have to remember that Six is trying to stop Mono from reaching the door when mono goes through the television. Mono is fixated on opening the door to let Hat Man out but Six at this point cares for Mono and thinks she is saving him when in fact she is saving herself from Hat Man because all Hat Man wants is Six because he thinks that will break the cycle and save his younger self."
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"So if six is stopping Mono from releasing the hat man 







Doesn’t she know about that relationship between mono and hat man"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,Don't think so. She is just believing she is saving Mono
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"And y the hell does mono start at the beginning of the game in a forest next to a TV




Does the maw ever get referenced in LN2"
nuqalg,2021-06-07,2021-06-08,"No idea why it starts like that.

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Slay the Spire. Absolutely not my thing. Card based? Turn based? No thanks. Yet somehow I’m addicted. Such a great game that I’ve spent way too many hours on.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Don't particularly enjoy turn-based RPGs, but I really enjoyed Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth because they still kept everything else that makes Yakuza Yakuza. I also really like the Wild Arms games as well, and Final Fantasy 10 is pretty much the only Final Fantasy game I've played and enjoyed.

I don't know when it hooked me but at some point it just clicked. Maybe the music? The setting? The drive to see what Vegas looked like? I dunno. But god damn it is amazing.

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Everspace which is a rogue lite. I really fell in love with that game and I've tried several other rogue lite games and none of them have really hit the same sweet spot that game did. Everspace is the perfect combination of starting from scratch yet keeping enough from the previous run. No other rogue lite hit that same perfect combination in my humble opinion.

I enjoy the process of developing my camp, developing my resources, economy, and military defense, then dealing with the enemy as he starts to harass me. Meanwhile I send out scouts to see where he is setting up camp. And then I devise an offensive strategy. I win 90% of the time, playing on the very hard level. It’s fun and doesn’t get inside my head like some of these games. I wish there were still network games available for Cossacks. You can have your first person shooters, where you look the opponent in the eyeball before you blast his brains out. Or your hyper realism for every light source and shadow is amazing. All that is kind of unnecessary and maybe a distraction. I just want a good clean Game, with a lot of dynamics and solvable problems."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Resident Evil

I HATE horror. I hate being scared. But I weirdly enjoyed the games. And I'm not talking the campy 4, 5, and 6  (though I prefer those more), I mean the actual Survival Horror: 2, 3, 7, and 8.


I suppose I was just fascinated by all the characters, especially Ethan Winters, I love me a well written character that pushes me through absolute hell. Would I ever play them again? 2 and 8 yeah, 3 probably, and 7 definitely not"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Detroit: Become Human.  Narrative heavy game with QTE?  

One of the best games I've ever played."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Quake Live, PVP FPS genre never really hook me until I tried Quake Live, the movement, the map, and the weapons are so fun, the veterans of the game are brutal tho"

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Defense Grid 2. Is never played a tower defense game and now it’s a staple in my library
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I pretty much only played FPS games until FABLE 2 then everything changed. That gotta come out with a remake.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Elden Ring

I only put 30 hours into it and I doubt I will ever dive deep again. But I get it, it was a blast. I'm very picky and if a game has literally zero narrative choices, and you cant affect the story in any meaningful way I'm already not super stoked on it. But Elden Ring was cool for a lil bit."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I was never one for strategy/management games because they usually just stress me tf out, but Banished was quite a nice suprise for me. As an rpg fan I liked the fact that you start with a little group of wanderers with randomly generated names, and that anything can happen to the town you build with them. 

Caves of Qud was a really atmospheric one too, though I don't usually do text-based/ASCII stuff. I remember unlocking a super rare achievement by accidentally decimating the entire tutorial area...good times"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Naraka Bladepoint had me hooked for a few months despite me really not liking battle royales. I wish it was more popular but the small playerbase makes the learning curve extremely punishing.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I picked up Prodeus recently, and as someone who does not typically play FPS games, that game had me HOOKED!"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Tactical RPGs never did it for me, but there was something special about Front Mission 3. I don’t even really like robots, but that game got me somehow."

like power wash sim and some little robot puzzle game and more"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I can't usually do cozy, farming Sims like Stardew Valley becuase the clock, ironically, stresses me out. But LittleWood made it so the clock only moves when you take an action and that made all the difference in the world. After that it became easier to play the other Sims so. I also enjoyed Harvestella and My Time at Portia."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Not necessarily it's own game, but the card game Queen's Blood from FF7 Rebirth had me hooked. Solid mechanics and not too complicated"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I am not the biggest fan of horror games (I live with anxiety, can’t do that to my heart during my down time). Deadly Premonition, for some reason, grabbed my attention. Outside the obvious performance issues, I really enjoyed the story it told. Good story in a game is a real winning point for me."

Never liked shooters, but I loved playing horde mode with friends."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Wartales. I really like the overall premise of the game, and I love all of the RPG elements. It's also got a surprisingly interesting world, and a decent storyline if you care to follow along with it. I've also found it to be easier than a lot of other games with similar combat systems (ex. Xcom)."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,My PS5 came with Gran Turismo 7. I would never have bought it otherwise. Now I have over 80h of playtime! Racing Sims are fun!

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Overwatch 

I never liked FPS on console but since it was a new game from Blizzard I thought I'll give it a try. Since my first match the disc only went out of the Playstation like 3 or 4 times and that was 7 years ago...."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Project X Zone 1 and 2. I generally don't prefer tactical rpgs, but I was sold in the cast and tried it based on that and was pleasantly surprised how much I was enjoying them.

Didn't translate to other t-rpgs though. I've tried a few others, but I think I only played X Zone for the cast.

Still thinking about trying Fire Emblem soon though"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Final Fantasy, don’t love the universe, but enjoyed the gameplay"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Technically not from the genre but it shares ton of same mechanics:

I hate ""open-world survival crafting"" but Satisfactory was huge hit for me. Probably because it wasnt ""punch trees simulator"" and I could make machines do the gathering and crafting for me.

Another one: I hate Card-battlers but ""Black Book"" was pretty great for me because it has that something. Slavic folklore/myths? Demons? Witchery? Set in age where religion was rising but still people believed in myths? Count me in."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Oxenfree. Not my genre at all, but enjoyed the hell out of it. I even have multiple playthroughs"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I don't play a lot of platformers, but Astro Bot was just too much fun to put down."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I always disliked fps games until I played DOOM Eternal and eventually the rest of the games in the franchise. Still the only fps that really got me hooked
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Souls-likes? Sekiro, Nioh, all that crap? Not a fan. I've got a limit to the amount of stress and patience a game takes before it stops being fun, and it's just not high enough for experiences like that. But Elden Ring gave me free reign. Exploring the world was so magical that I was willing to put myself through hell to get to the end. Never beat Melania solo. Don't care, it was cool. DLC was cool, waited until seamless co-op with a friend to play through that."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I absolutely hated the dread that the first the first last of us gave me. But I remember every single part of that game, it's so terrifying, so stressful, so stress.  But man oh man I do love that game. I'll only play it once every 5 years though."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Used to hate sandbox games when I was younger but Minecraft changed that (for the better probably) because it was this game, you could build anything, with thousands of blocks, play survival, it's hard and scary, but you can get diamonds! I was like 5 or something"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Stardew Valley. I tried to get into Harvest Moon and Story of Seasons games as something to play with my wife. Stardew was just better somehow. And moddable.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Overwatch.  I loved Doom and the story modes of Halo but  I was never a fps-pvp person nor the type to play a healer and really got into playing flex support

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Not a great fan of moba or hero shooters. Monday Night Combat was both and I love it. It had something special about it, and I'm sad it died. "
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I don’t normally like stealth games, but a few years back a friend of mine gifted me the original Thief Gold on steam.  I played three levels and specifically recall the third level was absolutely terrible being a nightmarish labyrinth like maze.  I quit for a year and a half after that but randomly returned when they reminded me of it and I got completely hooked.  The controls are a little cumbersome and there are abusable things with physics, but The Sword level legitimately is when the game hits it’s stride and you get to play for a long time in the middle of the game’s prime.

It is a very atmospheric game and you have lots of different ways to approach a problem, ended up finishing the whole game in about 20 hours and was really surprised with the whole thing.  Various light and sound puzzles will trick you and force you to think hard.  The game is filled to the brim with little things that don’t change gameplay but you can do for fun, like drawing on the map given to you on each mission, as though you were literally drawing and making your own personal notes.  It may be a bit old but I can only imagine how much time I would’ve spent screwing around in this game at its inception."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I dont like Military Shooters but Titanfall 2s movememt made for a fun campaign. The platforming sections were the highlight. 
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Return to Moria, i hate survival crafts but i got hooked into it. Looking for more games now. Dawn of Defiance was great. Didnt like Valheim tho. Tried enshrouded too but got bored idk."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I have tried quite a few roguelikes now, but the only one that stuck was hades. It really does transcend the genre for me. It took me like 20 tries to get my first completion, but at 100 attempts I was up to a 50% success rate."

I'm normally a ETS2, Farm Sim and the likes guy, but after the Edgerunners anime, i decided to buy the game, and while i did spoil most things for me, playing a shooter like it was nice and i really liked it.

The only games similar that i had played were Portal 1,2 and mods like Aperture Tag and PS:M, as well al Lego City Undercover and World of tanks (stopped playing before the HE changes)."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"No Man's Sky. I should hate this game. I usually hate crafting. I usually hate building. I usually hate exploring open worlds because I vastly prefer linear games. I usually hate resource management. 

But I've been hooked on this game for two months, and have put over 130 hours into it in that time, which is way more hours than I usually spend gaming in a two month period. I just love everything about it, and it's the perfect game to play on my Steam Deck while laying in bed with my wife at night. I'm a big reader and usually read a book a week, but I've barely touched my Kindle since I've started No Man's Sky because all I want to do is play this game."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Sea of stars, normally don’t really care for turn based rpg’s like FF but I enjoyed sea of stars."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"9 hours 9 Persons 9 Doors. Why bother with visual novels when you can just read a book. Well, the story, the twist, the flowchart, even some of the gameplay, an experience I wish I could start again with no prior knowledge."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Halo II. Never played the first, and once it went online, didn't even bother with it. First Person Shooter's, games where players are jacking off over the skin, armor, weapon customization, Online multiplayers, and especially the toxic chat, never was my thing. That game though, that game took many hours of many summers for me"

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Not a fan of soulslike games but really enjoyed both Surge games. I think it largely had to do with the setting and aesthetic, it helped carry me through the frustrating bits."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Bruh. Euro Truck Sim 2. Like why? Why do I even like this? I don’t know. Cheaper than therapy. Easier and cheaper than actually driving around.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I was never an RPG guy but the Like a Dragon series is awesome.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I was never into grid strategy games until Fire Emblem Awakening.

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Didn't grow up playing RTS besides a little Age of Empires, but I did end up enjoying WH40k Dawn of War and C&C Tiberium Wars back when I played them.

Also God knows I never played any Diablo but I did enjoy Grim Dawn a lot, at least until it became more difficult and my build started falling apart."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing. Really don't care for racing games, but I loved learning all the shortcuts and secrets in the game. Finding the developer test track after using cheat codes for infinite time was magical as a kid."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"Terraria. Not even sure why I tried it, but I ended up playing it for quite awhile. I normally play pretty much just RPGs. Nowadays when I need a break from RPGs I'll play those builder type games, though I'll usually lean towards ones with combat in them. Currently playing My Time at Sandrock."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Devil May Cry 5. Always been a FPS guy and DMC was my first hack n slash I completed. Got hooked from the start and now hack n slashes are one of my favorite genres.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Undertale. I usually don't go for pixel art games but I really enjoyed that one.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"I hate zombie genre. Games, movies, tv shows. Just isn't my thing. But The Last of Us captivated me in a way no game ever had or has since. I've never been so engaged and invested in the characters I'd met in that game. It felt like a story, rather than a video game that had a storyline in it, if that makes sense."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Not a fan of tactics style games. Only ever played 3 and they were all on PS1.

Baldur’s Gate 3 is now in my top 5 favorite games of all time. The seamless transition from exploring/adventuring to battling is nice. Almost any way you can think of to tackle an encounter is possible. And the open world really does allow you to proceed and make choices in however order you want to."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"God of War: Ragnarok - Valhalla

I do not like rogue likes, but this dlc was a lot of fun."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,For me it was Counter Strike Global Offensive… I’m mostly a Minecraft/Stardew Valley type gamer. The friends I met on Minecraft from a different country would play CSGO and I was feeling left out so I started playing as well. I’ve never played by myself/without someone I know in my party because I’m terrible at first person shooters but they made it worth the struggle :)
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Halo, I never liked fps and ended up playing all the halos and never really played any other fps. I guess fallout is a fps too but barely?"

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"I absolutely despise souls games(please don't attack me).

But Elden Ring is easily my 3rd favorite game of all time, behind Red Dead 2 and BOTW. 

Oddly enough, I simply *cannot* get into any other game in the genre, like not even a little. I tried the souls games themselves, Lords of the Fallen, Lies of P, even the Crab Treasure game or whatever lol. 

Idk what it is, Elden Ring just does it so perfectly."

But when I discovered Call of Duty for the first time,  at the beginning of the year (yes, I was way late to the trend), I was hooked. I love reading, so I read every article online I could find about the back stories of each character. It was a deep rabbit hole and I'm still in it. I even cosplayed as Ghost for SDCC 😅 I still suck at shooting games though."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Remnant: From the Ashes. I don't generally like souls-likes, but for some reason Remnant works for me. It might be the ease with which you can alter your build to suit a given fight or generally the greater emphasis on ranged combat that makes it better for me. I can't quite put my finger on it, especially because Remnant 2 doesn't work for me as well as 1 did. I do also really like the worlds presented in the game. They're damaged but not dead yet, they'll find their way so there's some hope as opposed to most souls-likes where it feels like you're really just delaying the inevitable."

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,Monster Hunter World. Never understood what made it so fun to run around and just smack big monsters with a stick. Never looked past the cover or gave it a chance until years later when it was a free Playstation hit and I was bored. Best choice I ever made to play it and find out that it is extremely satisfying and it's a lot more than just swinging a stick. One of my all time favorites now and I am super excited for Monster Hunter Wilds
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,I don't normally enjoy Puzzle games. I went into Tunic thinking it's just a fun cute lil casual zelda-style adventure game.

1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"I love roguelikes and card building. If you liked that one a lot, may I suggest inscryption or balatro? Inscryption is awesome and the less you know the better but balatro the more is like video poker but with jokers and each joker does something different"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"At the time when it launched, I thought Final Fantasy X was the most immersive game I had ever played. Getting to Besaid for the first time and seeing the beach with the music, blew my mind. 

That whole game is just an incredible adventure, in a way that the most recent one, Final Fantasy XVI, really isn't. 

(I love the story and style of FFXVI by the way, it's just the locales and exploring are really not that great by today's standards, let alone taking my breath away like FFX did)."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"skyrim is much more streamlined than oblivion but it's also bigger in scope, however if u follow the bigger quest lines, it is designed like oblivion in that sense, so it should also be manageable. it's not a ubisoft type map filler"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Enjoy! It's an awesome experience *that will totally devour your life*
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,What's the difference between a tactics game and a strategy game?
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I am usually much more of a dystopian future aesthetic lover but both witcher 3 and skyrim (and to a degree kingdom come deliverance) have pulled me into medieval fantasy worlds
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"New Vegas has more in common with other Obsidian/fallout 1 and 2 than other Bethesda games. Outer Worlds could be a better next step than Skyrim. I love both, but if you’ve bounced off Bethesda games before, I definitely recommend the Obsidian stuff."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I've played a few rougelites games and Hades is IMO the best one out there. Each play through can be very different and I am looking forward to the sequel.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"That game is so special. And I find it sad and hilarious that a lot of people who scoffed at it, actually enjoy it more than the main game it was meant to be an appetizer for. It's so charming and satisfying, and makes the continuous string of side-quests feel meaningful. You're actually making a difference for the people and the town itself. It's a feel good game lol

I enjoy lots of games in similar genres but I can't think of any games that have the same vibe of growing a town and helping people. Though I can think of games that do that. Stuff like Xanadu Next, Ys Oath in Felghana, or Astlibra Revision which are all full blown RPGs where you're tied to a town and have to quest around it to help people and figure out what the big town mystery is and stuff. But I love that narrative.. Chasm and Hollow Knight are Metroidvanias which kinda do that too"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,It's like a Diablo game in the world of the Fifth Element lol I love it
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Best door closing simulator on the market.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Alan Wake has a lot in common with Resident Evil 7 with the pacing, narrative, and gameplay all intertwining"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"If you own a series X, the fable games all have ""fps boost"" I believe. I used it in Fable 3 and it was absolutely amazing."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"I usually play sports games, but yeah Fable 2 was amazing.  I'd love to see a remake."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-30,"I went my whole life disliking fighting games and this year got really into playing SF 3rd Strike and it's the same way. It's still pretty popular for a late 90s game but a lot of the people have literally been playing it for decades so the learning curve online is NUTS.


I was really feeling it the other day, thought I was on some big shit and challenged a guy with A rank. The dude literally Perfected me two rounds in a row with Akuma. I couldn't even fathom what happened. I had to watch the replay like 10 times in disbelief lmao. 


Humbled me up real quick. "
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Have you tried My Time at Sandrock? It's pretty fun but it takes the emphasis off of farming and puts it more onto building instead when compared to most other farm/community sims. However I'll warn you going into it i personally experienced a really annoying bug that completely broke a quest for me.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-30,"Ultra kill and Selaco are two really fun shooters you might like. Ultrakill is fast and has lots of weapons and insanely good music. Gives me Doom Eternal feeling in terms of Gameplay. 


Selaco is like if Duke Nukem 3D came out today. There's a ton of environmental interaction. After a battle the rooms you fought in are a mess where everything's scattered around and broken, blood and body parts everywhere, bullets holes and shell casings. 


And as a side note. Look into Brutal Doom if you havent seen it yet. It's pretty amazing too. "
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-10-01,"Wasteland 3 is a treat if you like Xcom. You might also like Divinity Original Sin 2. Combat in both are similar to XCOM. 


Wasteland 3 in particular is very good if you enjoy building up your characters skills, stats, abilities, weapons, armor etc. And the story is pretty good too even. "
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"also, good music"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-30,[https://youtu.be/aKZX6VauzpU?si=ZaknBJT2a53LuxFQ&t=30](https://youtu.be/aKZX6VauzpU?si=ZaknBJT2a53LuxFQ&t=30) Youre famous
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Becoming more powerful is always something fun in those types of games. Have you tried the prime games our arkham Asylum? I always recommend those to people who normally don't like those types of games.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,Do. I dislike Turn based as well. But I loved the game. Even loved the turn based combat.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,Can you play it without having played the previous 2?
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I'm supposed to be the smarty.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I think he just means like pvp modes such as Gambit
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Lol, I have been actively avoiding Balatro because I suspect it will suck me in like Slay the Spire. I’m definitely going to give it a try closer to the holidays when I have plenty of time off! I haven’t looked into Inscryption, but going to take a look since you suggested it. Thanks for the recommendations!"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,"They're closely intertwined, so a lot of them can be both. But generally, strategy is larger scale and tactics are smaller scale decisions. 

StarCraft, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander etc. are more strategy games because they are about commanding (large) armies and building bases. Losses are often calculated into attacks and replenishing them is a big part of the genre (production). 

XCOM, Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics etc. are more about controlling smaller, often singular, units and trying to mitigate losses as much as possible, as they often die permanently and can't be 'remade' as they are 'unique'. 

They aren't super black and white genre's though, as far as I am aware. Like StarCraft II pro's often engage in very small scale attacks early in the game which is *basically* more tactical than typical strategy. There's some cross-over for sure, if nothing else."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"I've played a bit of outer worlds, but despite putting maybe 10 to 15 hours into it (educated guess) I find it's the opposite of the OP. I went into it enjoying the genre and loving new vegas, but there's multiple somethings about outer worlds that just makes it a very mediocre experience for me. Don't think I can really put my finger on (all of) them."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"There's a few good jrpgs that do the world building. Ni No Kuni 2 builds up a kingdom from nothing. Atelier Meruru, you actually get to see the maps change as you develop them and a town grow on the world map. Ys 8 is good too seeing the island town grow. Then there's also some rpgs to a lesser extent, like Fable 2.

I always love getting to see a town or world around me, develop and change. It's satisfying."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Yeah, if it's anything like Portia, the time constraints are minimal. The story quests happen when you do them, and that's it. The homestead doesn't need babysat like a farm does. You can do most stuff at your leisure. And if you can keep yourself from feeling pressured to do stuff they're pretty chill games"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-10-01,"I've heard lots of good about ultrakill so that's definitely a game I wanna get to. Haven't heard of selaco before but I'll look it up.

I've actually played through ultimate doom with brutal doom and it definitely is very good"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-30,Whoa sweet. Anyone want my autograph?
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,What made you like the turn based combat? I hate it with a passion and don’t think anything could convince me to try it
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,yes
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Absolutely. There's lore and history you may appreciate with the other two, but by no means is it needed. The story gives you everything you need to enjoy it and is largely stand-alone. It's an incredible experience with some of the best ""choose your own adventure"" potential I've ever seen. Truly the closest anything has ever come to making a video game feel like a d&d campaign. Seriously, if you play this game, you're basically equipped to pick up a pen-and-paper d&d 5e game and mostly be ready to go (some things are changed for ease of gameplay, plz don't fight your DM because of how something works in BGG3, even if it's the same most of the time)."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,I shitted it!!
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-28,☝️
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,No problem! Just picked up another one of those gambling types. Balatro is also on mobile now
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Ditto. I love the genre, I love the company. I just could not get into it. I guess we enjoyed different things about New Vegas than what the Outer Worlds fans enjoyed about New Vegas. I'm happy for them. But I probably have to stick with the games inspired by Fallout 1 and 2. Thankfully there's a ton of those lol"
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,You have so much freedom and options.
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,Thank you. I abhor turn-based tactics but... Let's see...
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"It's turn based, but very engaging at the same time. It can still feel hectic and pressuring, but rewards thought and tactics. And again, I cannot stress enough how much you can make your own story, and then replay it for a totally different turn of events and experience."
1frbxgg,2024-09-28,2024-09-29,"Haha thanks but I'm already familiar with the make-your-own-story magic. It's why I'm currently finishing up Dragon Age series despite loathing isometric cameras. Dipped my toes in Origins a few months back, just tying up loose ends in Inquisition looking forward to Veilguard."
x0tj8j,2022-08-29,2022-08-29,"Yes, it is good fun. If you like 1, you will like 2."
x0tj8j,2022-08-29,2022-08-29,Yep
x0tj8j,2022-08-29,2022-08-29,Yes.

wluccg,2022-08-11,2022-08-11,"If you don’t mind going retro, I highly recommend Another World. Pretty sure they released a 20th anniversary edition on modern platforms a few years ago."
wluccg,2022-08-11,2022-08-11,"If OP wants to go a *little* less retro, there’s Phantasmagoria, made back during the full motion video CDROM days. Available on Steam, though I have no idea how well it runs"
ygfc82,2022-10-29,2022-10-29,"I love the little nightmares games,  but don't know how they'd adapt a game with zero dialogue into a tv show.

Will they only be adopting the first game,  or the other two too? What about the dlc with the little boy in secrets of the maw?"
w2zpfw,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"As someone who hasn't played the game, it reminds me more of 1 World Trade Center (the original, aka north tower).

I don't know if there are some alternate viewpoints in game where it looks different."
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,"Found this game at a Blockbuster, with just the CD and this art as the cover. 10$. No other information. Snapped it up because of the art alone.

&#x200B;

Best purchase I ever made."
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,It's ICOnic.

The disc has a theme of the ICO cover from what I remember."

19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,One of my all time favorites. Such a beautiful game.

19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,"Major childhood flashbacks with this post

I remember playing this and then getting my hands on the original Shadow of the Colossus with the paper box and art cards 

I really can't remember the studio name but man they cranked out some amazing titles for the PS2

Fuck I'm old 😂"
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,Absolutely agree!)
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,One of the best. Had played it ages ago but went back to platinum it before i dropped out of the premium ps plus plan because of the horrid price changes. It's so good and a real treat to play. Would love a modernized remaster.
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,Looks like a painting from Salvador Dali
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,looks like art form 90's pc magazines

19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,I have the stupid USA one.
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,Especially when compared to the US cover art. Fucking Ick!

Studio name is actually 'Team ICO' but I think they disbanded..."
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,Team Ico
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,"From my understanding there wasn't any specific ""official"" team, but they were sort of referred to as ""Team Ico"".

The idea was that the studio formed teams for specific projects, and the team that was formed to create Ico and later Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian with the leadership of Fumito Ueda, was dubbed ""Team Ico"" after the first game they made.

It wasn't like it was all the exact same people working on these 3 games and more getting hired in addition. It was somewhat flexible or freeform.

The actual ""name"" of the ""studio"" from my understanding was ""Japan Studio"" (or at least was in the later years, before Sony disbanded it), which collaborated with and created many original games. From what I can remember, one example of staff moving around from project to project was that some of the people who worked on The Last Guardian also worked on Puppeteer (PS3) and Gravity Rush (at least GR2), except the high ranking/key developers."
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,It's inspired by the works of [Giorgio de Chirico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_de_Chirico).

19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,It definitely wasn't his idea: the NA version of Ico had to hit market by a certain date and they didn't have enough time to finalize this cover (the JP/EU version) or add in features found in that version (like the alternate watermelon ending IIRC)
19ex2rm,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,That's fascinating. I never knew that and always thought the NA version went the angry Kirby eyes route and made it stupid on purpose in an attempt to appeal to Western sensibilities.

lzsnf6,2021-03-07,2021-03-07,"i DID draw this, and nobody ever believes that."
