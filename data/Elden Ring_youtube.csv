@JC-oq5ex,"So instead of a soul of cinder who linked the fire, the night lord is probably the almagamation of the un-linked fire ending characters.

@di11_9,"Everyones talking about nameless king and firekeeper but not the fact morgott is still alive when we seen him die same could be said about the other two when the land of shadow is meant for the dead not wherever this place is, weird how the grace of gold still exist meaning canonically we never became frenzied or became ranni's consort but instead marikas.",0
