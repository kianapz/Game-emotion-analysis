@utareangara5529,PVP? no on cares. it would take FULL PVE to bring people back,0
@guilhermeviana3669,"6x6
Hero talents
Ban System
Shows a new hero gameplay
Shows another hero concept to be released on Spring 2025

That's my guesses, but I know I can be dissapointed.",0
@heccy7874,We expecting from this more disappointment and scams,0
@cptnswg,maybe they're just adding a hero ban system for comp,0
@mrsilencer5542,skill tree guyd,0
@PoolGyall5441,I feel like it's going to be the Junkensteins lab system or the pickable passives. I hope things like hero bans will also be in there if that's the case.,1
@jaivettasheem1314,"Calling the PR speak now, Its gonna be the same slow content release with more skins and a small change to rank. Playing ow all these years you learn not to trust anything they say. Plus bet the new heros are gonna be same no skill auto abilities.",0
@vividdaydream1516,"Building on the ""pickable passives"" idea, what if players had the option to use older hero abilities that aren't in the game anymore?  For example, Torb could swap out his Overload ability with Repair Packs, or Mercy could choose which form her resurrect takes (cooldown ability or ultimate).",3
@redtiger8275,7v7,0
@Enkeria,PVE or no go.,0
@jackgibson16,Marvel rivals got them to actually do something with their game in years,1
@1mrmrc265,"What if the new heroe releases on season 15?? I mean, would be weird to bring content creators to play a hero that still releases in 2 and a half months, plus they‚Äôve had since march 2024 (when rivals was announced) to adapt and create a ‚Äúcontingency plan‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs plausible",0
@jamesstrain1631,I am hoping to see Maximilien revealed as a future hero,1
@Kamil_Horvath,"Well shoot. This is the make or break. If max isnt there he wont be coming.
Also Czech map please! (I really really dont want a map or hero from denmark before we get anything from czechia)",0
@timothyboddie2724,yeah I'll believe when I see it. I don't trust anything from Blizzard anymore.,0
@MilyDephlina,"My hopes not that hgh. But I expecting PvP Talents, soon.",0
@lordgossamer,Overwatch VR?,0
@prestonbrasswell5237,Anyone feeling Armed and Dangerous,1
@billyr2904,The thumbnail: why are Kiriko's teeth so scary?,0
@i-EOJ-,"I‚Äôm a little worried whatever groundbreaking changes they have planned are possibly still developing and won‚Äôt debut next season, which would kill a lot of hype",2
@L30BLACK,Hazard is the only hero I know that had hype and it immediately disappeared,0
@gocatsgo08,Imagine if they announce Overwatch 3 üòÇ,2
@LEOFOX9000,"do we have to watch overwatch‚Äô stream? or is it the said content creator‚Äôs to get the skin?

(i‚Äôm semi new to the game, so idk)",1
@siren519,Ground breaking news Jeff Kaplan comes back and makes the game more relevant again.,0
@matadorsnipes3420,"Let me save you guys the time, 13 minutes of opinions, just wait for the official overwatch stream",0
@SleepTrip2000,"I came here to say that it's too late, we've played this game too long and been played too long by these devs. Too little, too late. I uninstalled when rivals came back and i haven't or will never look back.",0

Have an gathering hub to talk and can edit pose of character. 
Have porn contest once every 3 months to pvp with another people. 
Support bluetooth device and VR for more PVP content.",0
@toviwhtiley8691,PvE is still happening that shit takes time,0
@lilboiflacko7672,Remove bot account please,1
@tapejara1507,Overwatch 3 ;),1
@playthegame131,Is there any chance of a revival of 6vs6 matches??,2
@Chinesetakeout382,"I would love to see the perk system from junkenstien‚Äôs lab get at least get some tests or an arcade mode to see if it‚Äôs viable to put in the main game.  

One of my biggest issues with overwatch has always been that the characters are kinda ridged.  That there‚Äôs not really any alternate ways to play these characters you love without intentionally crippling yourself.  Perks that shake that up would be really cool.  There would likely still be an overall most optimal build, but the existence of different ways to play your favorite characters would be really cool.",3
@santiagocanovas1570,It better be Maximilien‚Ä¶,0
@aqueleRu,"I'm both skeptical and curios, on one hand Overwatch needs to do something get everyone's attention again. 
On the other hand, last time they did big changes (Season 9) it made the game worst for me.",0
@DeClayz,7:37 damn... that rein really wanted your ass and just failed horribly,2
@deyeti,"Part of me wants to be hopeful, but Blizzard has made me so jaded that I feel like whatever they end up doing is going to fall short of expectations.  If its more than adding stuff that Rivals has plus putting 6v6 into the game a a permanent mode (probably arcade), then they will have beat my expectations.  Now, whether those changes are ones I'll actually enjoy is something else.",0
@daj27,I‚Äôm just hoping they announce a new animated short,1
@philliptraum2788,"Jarvis, play ‚ÄúI can change‚Äù from the South Park movie on repeat.",1
@Yaqins,"Let's be honest, it's gonna be underwhelming. They've been over hyping up things that turned out to be mediocre all the time. Venture skins, Brig ""rework"", Rank new reward, etc which all of them were called ""huge"".",8
@itsmax9535,"i hope we do not get a new mode
we should get more maps for existing modes",0
@mediumrare4737,Would love some rivals content from my OG hero shooter YouTuber,0
@mariopikmin1,Why is he forcing me to eat q peanut butter snack ? Unsubscribe,1
@angelgae3128,No PVE = No point,1
@ReivecS,It has always killed me that this game is best played with a team you are familiar with and yet they have never put in any features to encourage team play. Guilds/clans are the only thing that would get me super pumped.,16
@KKJazz,Add hero passives AND bans all in one season. Would shake things up wildly.,0
@jamestolliver2836,"I'd like to see them add a rogue-like mode (in the Arcade), like combining Junkenstein's Lab with Hero Mastery or basically an Overwatch version of Roboquest.",2
@godsofegypt,"what to expect : absolutely nothing 
what we are going to get : absolutely nothing  + new expensive skins + recycled content",5
@YonesisXDXD,Holy shit we gonna get Overwatch 3 Loot boxes rising I cannot wait üôè,3
@AnimeOtaku56.,My guess is hero talents and a map vote.,1
