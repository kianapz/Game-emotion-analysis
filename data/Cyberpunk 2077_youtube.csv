@KidaMilo89,"The character creator still never held its promise. it's barebones as it gets just like in Outer Worlds for instance. CPDR mentioned making a game with the best character customization possible and there has been minimal changes to it. Still stuck with presets, and no sliders. Why does masculine V still look like a twink pornstar? I had tor resort to mods because male V lacks any visible masculature. You'd think the ""body"" stats with also affect your build for some immersion.",0
@InfectedByZanza,"Choom, you see this dreck CDPR‚Äôs slinging? Patch 2.2? More like 2.2 many lies. Corpo suits said ""We fixed everything!""‚Äîbut I still got cars spawning inside walls, NPCs with the IQ of a malfunctioning toaster. Anyway, choom, keep your optics peeled. Trust a corpo? Might as well hand your creds to a fixer and ask for a ""fair deal.""",0
@skatanchurch,"I have only PS5 no PC, but expect the game looks much better on PC atm right? But i dont understand why there is such a huge update for console if it is does nothing?",0
@gloth,the transformer model is not about frame gen mate. its a different technique for how upscaling works.,0
@Durzza,people  wanting for more content seem to ahve forgotten that the current CDprojekt is a woke sloppy pos company.  we are NOT  getting old CD level  games again.,0
@DRlSE,"I can‚Äôt believe this game is still going, have such a bad test for this game, got it at launch. Too little too late‚Ä¶.",0

@thaKiddino,The patches are just literally adding stuff that should've been at the beginning of the game. I'm not complaining though,1

@jaymr2795,"2:10 why did you leave this section in, when you explain why this happens in a weird way later. You clearly know why the performance is lower, quality != quality. Seems really weird.",0

@pizzahut235,Side note to add to the video I have a 4070 to super and the second I put on ray tracing with maxed out settings I was not even able to run it well with dlss quality.  Like 40 and 50 fps.  Now I get around 80 on average.  Huuuuge to me.  And dlaa looks crazy good and runs better.  Best way to play honestly,0

@Crashsquirrel72,so.... are the massive crashing problems fixed?,0
@pedrogodinho4649,"The transformer model isn't supposed to give you higher fps, it's supposed to give you better quality. It's a bit more gpu intensive, but it gives higher image quality than the old CNN based model (at least in theory)",0
