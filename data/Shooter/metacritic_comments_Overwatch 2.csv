Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-02-26,has a lot to work on to fix it's past. it's doing much better and i really love it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-02-16,"overwarch es un juegazo, ha tenido cambios inesperados pero es un goty! dmosle 1 oportunidad"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-02-12,"this game is awesome, it has good gameplay, fun characters and some interesting lore if you want to dig into it, it is a great game and i enjoy it quite a bit."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-27,"auch wenn das spiel nur ein ehrenloser cashgrab von blizzard ist, kann man nicht abstreiten, dass das spiel an sich gut ist. es wird immer wieder geupdatet und die events sind auch zumeist okay. ein fehlen der pve kmpfe und der kampagne ist trotzdem sehr sprbar."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-21,"recently, my account was suddenly suspended without any prior warning or clear explanation. the response from customer support was completely unhelpful, which has led me to seriously question the quality of blizzard's service."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-17,"al igual que muchos otros juegos online el emparejamiento no tiene ningn filtro, no existe. el control es bueno perono sirve de nada si te ponen jugadores muy veteranos y principiantes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-12,there are some people on here who are hurt because minor things have changed in the game. at core this is still the best hero shooter. yes it's better than marvel rivals. it's a lot of fun. there is a store and micro transactions like all ftp games. but i never felt the need to buy anything as it's only skins.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-08,"since its release, the game has slowly let down players. what started as a fun heroshooter in 2016 with overwatch 1 has now turned into a sad cash grab that is getting the life squeezed out of it by the developers. similar to titanic, the game felt very innovative and quite enjoyable, but once it hit the iceberg, known as cooperation greed, it slowly started to sink into the ocean. the gameship is now almost completely submerged yet the crew is still trying to sell overpriced  and souvenirs. any difference this game had to its predecessor is now completely stripped away due to the addition of 6v6. do not play this game, save yourself the headache and spare your brain cells."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-06,"hey do you like having fun, don't play this game. the only reason i'm not giving a 3 or a 4 is because it is free and sometimes it could be fun to play customs with friends."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-05,i cant take it. they took one of my favorite games and made it unrecognizable. the greed coming from blizzard genuinely needs to be studied. im done and will never go back.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-02,"bad game, bad company. i like getting milked but not like this. this is the perfect example of anticonsumer practices."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-01,just a lazier and a downgrade going to 5v5. disappointing that this couldn't deliver the pve with all the promises made years before this game was released.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-31,"coming to back to overwatch, thankfully in overwatch 2 i keep all my goodies from first game, sadly they fail to promise us full on story mode with our beloved  more loot box to be honest i miss its make getting skin earnable by playing fun. the battle passe its aright not bad its doble to lv up, only  is paying for premium ver. every season. so, earning skin potential is limited.6 v 6 is now 5 v 5 so if you got 6 friends one of them is getting bench.i'm reinhart main player only. got all the skins so, it's okay they add more characters to keep the game fresh. also, more for me glorious victory and honor. updated glad they brought the 6v6 back."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-29,"ils ont remplac les shield par les soins. ils est rgulirement impossible de tu quelqu'un tellement il y a de soins. la ranked et le sbmm sont casss. si vous avez le malheur de gagner trop de parties, le jeu vous mettra avec des joueurs qui sont mauvais et il vous sera quasiment impossible de gagner. horriblement frustrant. nous retirer overwatch 1 que l'on a payer! pour nous imposser cette horreur. plus jamais je ne dpense 1 pour un produit blizzard."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-23,"just disappointing gameplay. ontop of that, it's just an absolutely evil company"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-19,this is  worst game ever and the worst teams ever and also the worst characters
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-11,overwatch 1 was better but this this s is disappointed for too many reasons the season pass are bad the skins cost too much the bugs ruined the game and the worst part it go woke
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-11-29,"i have paid full price for this game several years ago. for some reason i recently received a pathetic and lazy money grabber. all the new skins, graffitis etc feel outsourced and just outright lazy as hell. the first game was 8.5 out of 10 and thats being very strict. this game is a 3, and all of them because of the first games legacy. i do not know who came up with all these new ideas, but this person should never have any influence on any game whatsoever again. this is outrageous and pathetic."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-11-24,"unfortunately, if this is the original overwatch, i would give a 810. however, with comparison, ow2 is just so disappointing and i just feel ow2 doesn't deserve to be an underdog to it's predecessor, in all aspect, from gameplay, lore, animation to music, this just disappointed me. i expected any game with a 2 should have at least some upgrades from 1. however, what i saw from ow2 was general downgrade, and the pve promised never delivers and they just updated numerous shop cash grab skin contents to hide the fact that they did nothing in5 years. if its simply the game itself i would give a 510, but with such a poor developing team, i can't bother giving any good score."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-11-06,"overwatch 2 aims to build on the success of its predecessor, introducing several significant changes while preserving the core gameplay that made overwatch a phenomenon. the shift to a 5v5 team format from 6v6 is a major change, enhancing the speed and intensity of matches and reducing overall chaos, though it requires teams to adapt strategies and redefine roles. the reworked hero abilities and new additions enrich gameplay options, though balance adjustments remain a critical  game introduces new maps and modes, including push, which brings a fresh dynamic and demands new strategies. overwatch 2 also expands the narrative with pve player vs environment missions that allow players to dive deeper into the characters stories and motivations. however, while the pve missions are interesting, they have yet to achieve the depth that some fans anticipated, remaining largely short and sporadic experiences.visually, the game has been upgraded with improved lighting effects and more refined details, yet it retains its iconic, colorful style. the soundtrack and sound design remain engaging and enhance immersion, much like in the original game. however, changes to the progression systemwith the introduction of a battle pass and fewer free cosmetic rewardshave faced criticism from the  summary, overwatch 2 introduces meaningful updates to gameplay and storytelling while retaining the vibrant, teambased action that defines the series, though certain changes have sparked mixed reactions among fans."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-11-04,my goto game at the moment despite the utter torture it puts me through every time i boot it up. i feel like everything promised during the overwatch 1 days were not delivered and now we're stuck with a meh game with 30 million microtransactions. i love causing myself pain as support main but eh
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-29,"like we would ever forget what they took from us, and what they promised us. yes we dislike what you made overwatch into, you whalefarming greedy aholes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-20,"um jogo revolucionrio na indstria dos fps personagens muito divertidos tima jogabilidade mais a galera taca hate porque esperavam que ia vir mais coisa,em geral  mesma coisa do 1 com algumas diferenas extremamente subestimado"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-16,"whole point of overwatch 2 was pve campaign, but they cancel that for no reason. many of pvp things goes on bad way. they deleted lootboxes, that feature was a whole point of grinding and still playing this game  now there is a battlepass, but it is not good. when you spend money 10usd, and get all tiers, you only get 50 of coins of battlepass price, so that means you need to buy microtransactions every season to get ,,grinding system back, because free levels are bad and no one want to grind them  it is bad, because other games with battlepass system, just giving you full refund of coins etc. after you complete all tiers. blizzard only think about money, every season they just finding a new way to add new coinsmicrotransactions. season 13 is now here and there is some little changes, that means nothing for new mechanics for gameplay etc. season 13 only added new cosmetics that costs money, and thats all. overwatch 2 is sometimes fun with gameplay for like 12 matches per dayweek, but i do not see any reason to play this game more often. everything is bad, devs don't care about players, only on skins and microtransactions."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-15,ahhh overrated 2! this game  so much eggplant id rather play tf2! nothing beats the original hero shooter of the 2000s. how a game that released in 2007 have better gameplay mechanics and innovation than this sewage container is beyond me. no wonder mike morhaime left. he saw his baby blizzard grow up and started doing something strange for some change. this series is just wow as an fps. bonus its free!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-13,"firstly, i am a female gamer and mercy player. i have been playing overwatch for 8 years. i used to have happy times for the past 7 years. but this year 2024, i was being bullied ingame. when i randomly match with players who are sharper than others, the other players will insult me something likebch mercy, booster cheating, team with cheating, and even bully me by maliciously reporting me. if i continue to play mercy regardless of my opponent's insults, my opponent will report me for joining the queue with accounts marked as cheating. if i stop cheering and wait for the match to end, my teammates will report me for not limited to, not participating in the game. now, all players know that if i am reported too many times, my account will be permanently banned. even though i didn't violate the blizzard rules, i will be treated and bullied like this just because i am a female player, and my main hero is mercy. i currently do not play games with friends in my team, do not join voice chat, and block all text chat. still, my account was permanently banned. i don't know how i can do to protect my account. i think blizzard is right to crack down on cheating players, but i don't know why you guys always banning noncheating players as well? this will not make the game environment better, because no matter whether the player cheats or not, they 're accounts will be banned. so, more and more players will choose to create new accounts to cheat because their main accounts have been wrongly banned! i sincerely hope that blizzard can listen to players' suggestions and modify the ban mechanism. i request that our account be unbanned immediately! i greatly appreciate your time in reading my appeal and sincerely await your positive response."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-11,who still plays this junk? i rather play et the game over this trailer trash
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-11,"overwatch is still an unique experience among countless fps competitive games. art style, game fee,l ui, sound are amazing. it is a pity that the game coudn't deliver on their earlier promises of expanded modes such as pve modes. although what is present is very well made. as far as live service, i feel it is very well supported oct 2024. patches come in a good cadence and devs do a good job wth communication with the community. balancing is not perfect, and never will in any competitive game but there are enough changes so any greater inbanlance is smoothed out. for anyone that doesn't have much time cosmetic rewards from battle pass and events are not too much  you dont need to play every single day and feel like a chore. and the art for cosmetics in this gam is actually one of the few in the industry i actually think is worth paying for most of the negatives from my experience come from the competitive aspect sometimes it is just frustating to deal with other players, theres tools for that but they just remedy it a bit. also the game is very fast paced and learning or coming back to it after a while can feel overwhelming. for monetazation i feel the battle pass is mostly worth it but shop cosmetics feel very expensive thankfully everything is completily options and its not hard to get some good customization for free or cheap for some of your most played heroes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-25,"overwatch a game, of which innovative for its time of release, entails a fast, actionpacked gameplay, involving heroes which you play with. however, blizzard released a second version overwatch 2, which was created to mediate the decrease in the popularity of the initial overwatch, which held promise. the initial stages of overwatch 2 indeed increased the lost interest of overwatch 1, especially during the initial stages of the sequels release, new maps, new characters. it could be said that it seemed promising. however, as time went on from the sequels release, more and more flaws, complaints arose from the sequel, mostly critiquing the main attraction of the game  the gameplay. the main premise of overwatch is for 2 teams to complete an objective, of which induces fights between these teams to progress their objectives. the main difference between overwatch 2 and 1 is that the sequel has 5v5 instead of 6v6. whilst superficially, it could be perceived as a novelty change to the game, instead this proved to be a major problem for the player base, and an even bigger problem for the old player base. this flaw consisted of the fact that they reduced the initial 2 tank roles to only 1 in rolebased matchmaking, although in open queue they do not have this problem as there is not a cap in the roles. the decrease from 2 tanks to 1 tank led to drastic changes to the tanks stats and abilities, which is quite difficult to balance, whilst also decreasing the number of combinations in the heroes you can pick, making the meta the current best combinations of characters vastly more prominent definitive in if you win a match or not. one of the main charms of the initial overwatch is the number of combinations of characters there could be, and the viability in each character, whilst there still being a main meta. but in the sequel, you would tend to see a repeat of the same characters depending on the viability of each character character combination, hence why i would rate overwatch 2 a moderate level below the original game in terms of fun gameplay. overwatch 2 also boasts a variety of game modes apart from the main modes, unranked and competitive ranked, and allow for community created game modes in the workshop. this allows for the community to create specific maps for aim, parkour, talking to others, and even trying to replicate rpg inside. gameplay 7.510 learning curve depends on what character you play. enjoyability biased depending on whether you played overwatch 1 or not. 610910 playability available on console and pc, also involves cross platform gameplay, allowing for better multiplayer experiences. 910 replayability 910 due to the 515minute games for quickplay and 1030minute games for competitive. nonetheless, apart from the gameplay, there has been moderate changes to the gui, which could be, subjectively cleaner and more visually appealing, and quite interesting novel changes like mythic skins, which were decently well received by the community. they also changed overwatch from paid access to free to play, albeit in the early stages of the sequel, still putting characters through a paywall  entailed a backlash. feedback response 810 graphics wise, overwatch 2 retains most of its cartoony aspect that it had in overwatch 1, not very high on the graphics, therefore easier to run on most platforms. it could be said that overwatch is much more  focused game rather than graphics, sfx, etc, therefore a lot less time is spent towards making the game look better, and more time is focused on balancing heroes. graphics 710 holistically, the sequel could be said to be a success, bringing in a new player base. however, overwatch 2 currently is not on par overwatch 1 commonly regarded as one of the greatest games of its time, period. overall rating 7.510."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-25,"overwatch is a 5vs5 teambased tactical shooter with loads of well designed characters and maps that present an incredible level of depth of understanding and skill that provide thousands of hours of intense gameplay the characters are designed very well with abilities revolving around different playstyles split up into three categories tank, dps and support each one playing a vital role in winning the game. however the balancing of these characters can be a little off and the community can be a little toxic even in game modes that are not meant to be competitive this was not helped by the developers adding leavers penalty into quick play forcing everyone to stay in a one sided game against their will this can create an unfun and demoralising experience in a mode that is not meant to be taken seriously. this has created a weird dynamic where the unranked game mode is taken more seriously than the ranked game mode. talking about ranked the only game mode where you will actually have fun on this game spending countless hours trying to make an icon display on your profile showing that you are slightly better than the people with other icons on there profiles stroking your own ego and releasing slight amount of dopamine to then have it wear off after a day and instantly start trying to hit the next rank. not to mention before you are even able to compete in ranked you have to sink a good couple hundred hours as overwatch is one of the more complicated esports also the developers receive criticism for making overwatch 2 free to play this may not sound like a bad at first but it means blizzard has to make their money through micro transactions that are incredibly overpriced leading players to drop stupid amounts of money for skins they could of received for free simply by playing overwatch 1. however, if you look past these problems you get an addictive shooter with a good competitive scene and a passionate developers wanting the game to succeed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-04,"overwatch 1 was one of the last good games blizzard made. when overwatch 2 was announced, we were hoping for a better version of overwatch 1. it was said that it would be especially pve focused. the most missing things in overwatch 1 were story and scenario modes, we were excited that we would have the opportunity to play the background lore prepared for overwatch 1 as singleplayer campaigns and taste that world. what came out was a cheap f2p version of overwatch 1 that was dumbed down and slain with micropurchases. they didn't care to fix overwatch 1's balance and matchmaking issues either, even worse, they messed up the ranking system further and removed important features. everything worth playing overwatch 1 has been thrown away in this second game. 2 intolerable  bad enough to make you refund the game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-13,"heres my problem with overwatch 2. it's overwatch, and overwatch is fun... if this game wasn't fun, we wouldn't play it. blizzard would be forced to fix it, but it is fun, so they'll continue to sell overpriced micro transactions, not fix the bugs, and lock characters behind paywall or some other stupid thing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-11,"it's fun but i wouldn't play it over any other modern tac shooter. the more you play the less fun it is and the more you see the sbmm be an actual disease. if you want to play a good tac shooter, play the finals, it's free and underrated, it will hold your attention for a at least a week or you'll become a long time player."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-04,they didn't deliver on basically the most important promises they made about the game and then found ways to nickel and dime. deserves all the hate and the company ruined their entire reputation doing things like this.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-03,overwatach 2  honestly but i have been playing for 6 years and i cant let go please help me.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-03,"overwatch 2 is a shameless money grab from blizzard. the game just overwatch one, but instead it is free. they use the excuse that it is free to shove constant micro transactions and battle passes down your throat whilst offering out previously rare and difficult to obtain skins for purchase that players of the first game took pride in owning. players of the first game got no reward for their nearly 60 purchase, and blizzard just pocketed their money and moved on, as per usual."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-09-02,"a management team who are completely disconnected from the community. they cater to content creators while ignoring the majority of their player base. cheating and smurfing is a massive issue in this game and it's made even worse when the cheaters in this game are allowed to run rampant for months before getting removed in a ban wave. then there's the horrible rank progression system and the way it works when someone leave a competitive match, which have insane consequences for the 4 players remaining on the team. the game literally punish players on the team if a random team member leave a competitive match by adding a loss to their account. the rank progression system also remove more rank progress when you lose compared to what you gain when you win. whoever came up with such an outrageously bad system that punish those left on the team when someone leave a competitive match should be fired.. if someone tilts and rage quits a competitive match, the lobby should close down, with no change to anyone's rank progress and sr other than the idiot who left because their ego got hurt. the matchmaker in this game is hands down the worst i've ever seen in any competitive games i've played since i started playing competitive shooters back in the very early quake days. all in all, for the vast majority of players who play in lower ranks, this is happening on a daily basis. matchmaker matching bronze players with gold players where the game sense and mechanical skills of a bronze vs gold player is like night and day. the rank division system is one that needs to be removed and revert the entire rank system back to ow1 standards with visible sr and more."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-31,just team fortress 2 but for gooners with no life whatsoever if you think this game is good go play some actually good fps games like halo and tf2
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-29,"mejor que esa basura de concord en el genero de los hero shooter, con culos, tetas y minas muy buenas y sin pronombres rancios"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-28,"wie kann man nur so unfassbar gut gemachte charaktere in eine so genialen welt erschaffen und das game dann so versauen. kein singleplayer, warum? bzw. war dieser unfassbar teuer, und dazu auch noch eher mittelmig. mittelmige grafik im vergleich zu dem, wie es sein knnte zeigen die pixarhnlichen kurzfilme, die alle samt in den bereich oskar gehrten, wenn man mich fragt, die story auch eher mittelmig und dazu hat man angefangen mehr auf diversity in einem der diversesten games berhaupt zu achten. warum? und noch eine letzte frage warum musste man die lootboxen entfernen? overwatch war ein vorzeigebeispiel von funktionierenden lootboxen, die einem nicht das geld aus der tasche zogen, die ingame gewonnen werden konnten und die nur kosmetische vorteile brachten. ich kann mir denken warum, man wollte sich der kritik entziehen, die andere entwickler abbekommen haben und dazu noch mehr geld mit dem battlepass erwirtschaften , der warum auch immer nicht gengend ingamewhrung enthlt, um ihn sich beim nchsten mal wieder zu holen. es ist einfach schwach, was aus diesem game geworden ist. mehr als die kurzfilme werde ich davcon nicht mehr anschauen, denn da steckt noch herz drin."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-28,"one of the better fps in my opinion. its one of those games that has a grip on me and wont let go. i keep finding myself wanting to play it and going back to it ever since i started it 7 years ago. no matter how many times i get upset with or tired of the game, give it some time and it will call to me again like the green goblin mask."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-22,"it's just boring  there is no real content other than role queue, which gets old really fast. unfortunately again, the dev effort is focused on cash shop items, not gameplay. overwatch 1 was better and way less monetised."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-15,"this game shouldn't have been released. it's still an overwatch, but everything about it, is a misunderstanding."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-14,"loved the game but the farther it went on its life cycle the worse the game became due to the decisioning of new characters added and the nerfsbuffs, and especially lack of changes to fix hard metas like goats. the metagame switch counters also became too heavy. overwatch 2 was also just a whole lie to the fan base."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-14,"the game is good in the competitive mode, but the gameplay in the other modes is bad. there is no creativity in the other modes, but the gameplay system is very wonderful. however, the only negative aspect of the game is that the arcade mode is bad."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-12,"fxcking eloless charactorcan match the same team 5 times.when there are no friends to play with, there is no joy at all, and it requires a lot of cooperation"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-08,"even though blizzard is run by  idiots that made overwatch 2 inferior to the original, overwatch's core gameplay is so good that the game still manages to be pretty fun, if a little frustrating. the fact that we aren't getting pve like we were promised still pisses me off though."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-07,"game is filled with lots of 'relatable' shallow characters. the company had a chance to remedy this through cinematic cutscenes, more backstories, improved cgi for the pve and less annoying shield meta. overwatch really for years has fallen into the trap of 'if we can rebalance, lets do so' and made the game absolutely repugnant compared to when it released. tank is not fun and barely requires any skille now, theres no concept of retreating or even a way to escape, its mostly just 'help the tank' which every other team mate does. its never been a 1v1 game, but it feel even less versatile now with no variation of which character to pick. this is insane to me and it ruins any way for now players to enjoy the game, this should only be reserve for competitive, but apparent ly blizzard did notunderstand not everyone wants to play that. pretty much everyone understands the big ass scam blizzard has made, making skins and herpes cost as much as a full game, so the 'free to play' is an illusion if you want to play the full game, unlike the old game where you could unlock new characters, skins, voice lines through free loot boxes. gameplay is still fun, but man, paying tank is so easy unless ur fighting a tank. 3.510"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-04,"they promised pve, which was most likely a sham from the getgo, then seeing they wouldn't be able to deliver anything new they took away content by removing one tank, and praised this as if it's a groundbreaking novelty... all that with the goal of justifying the '2' after the title and justify the making of a 'new' game, which paves the way for them to change the monetization model and rake in as much as corporate cash as possible thanks to selling overpriced skins to kids and new players who have never played the original overwatch. the zombification and basterdization of a title, just in the name of pure corporate greed, nothing more nothing less fellas. you know what, let's take away the onfire, the medals, the cards, the level borders too while we're at it... and add a bland scoreboard no one asked for. oh, the lootboxes too of course! let's take them away too! why give our playerbase the possibility to receive any esthetic in the game for free, while they can pay 10 bucks for a keychain, and 30 bucks for a skin!  you blizzard,  you for deleting overwatch and then parading this lifeless corpse  so as to squeeze as much as cash as possible."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-08-03,a lot of errors a lot of errors a lot of errors a lot of errors a lot of errors.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-07-25,"not updating pve mods, and so bad experience in game , bad, 's fps game but also a team play game, so you cannot do anything solo. this feels like.. a basical error of the game, it's . actually a piece of garbageexperience, playing, this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-07-08,copy paste game no pve with skill tree p2w battlepass but atleast the uninstall is free
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-07-01,"the change from 6v6 to5v5 just to justify the 2was an awful decision. the game has never been as fun as it was inoverwatch 1, and i no longer believe it ever will be at this point. so ive changed my score. its really sad what theyve done with it. some of the new characters too are really bad for the game. its clear the devs have no idea what they are doing as they slowly walk back the changes they made."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-29,i made a metacritic account just because of how much i hate this game and so you can know how much i hate this game.... i hate this game very very much.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-29,"not as good as overwatch 1 but i think they complimented a good ass new system in the game modes a fire ass heroes, people be mad for goofy ahh things"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-27,trash pathetic copy and paste full of broken promises and an extremely greedy company.overwatch 2 is a living example of what a video game should never be and will forever stay on the wall of shame in gaming history.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-18,awful!! all game characters look like plastic toys taken from a kids tv show. i am not 5 years old anymore to enjoy this trash. game is a money grabbing scam and the graphics are so cartoony and dumb looks pathetic. treating all your costumers as underage kids and try to exploit them with every chance. blizzard and its fanboys are cancer
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-16,"i usually like to write reviews with constructive criticism, but for this game, i just can't... i just wonder why they decided to make it freetoplay and ruin the whole game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-11,you hate blizzard for making overwatch trash and moneygrab machine i hate blizzard because its exists we are same.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-09,no just play tf2 is better because yes i hate this game dont play it is bad dont play it
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-08,"this game is much better than they say about it. at least you will not be bored and you can safely play a hundred hours with great pleasure. you can also call friends, which makes the gameplay much more interesting and more exciting"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-07,"this game is pretty bad, like, i get tanks that stay behind supports and supports that go as frontline and dps that hit the ground more than i ever did steps on, like, is there like some kind of handicapped queue im in and that im not aware of? or why do i get handicapped people the entire time on diamond elo? can someone explain? im confused of the spectrum people."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-06,"the game itself its not a 1 out of 10 but it 100 deserves a 1. it plays well most of the time, decent graphics, cool characters, amazing skins, pretty nice battlepass and dev's that communicate with the community. however none of that is what makes a game fun to play. if you plan on playing maybe an hour or 2 a week and do not care about ever getting better or trying to not  then give it a shot. but if your the kind of gamer who cares about getting better and learning how it works this is not for you. the dev's have absolutely no clue what they are doing, and force horrible unfun meta's and regularly buff the most hated hero's the game has so they are the most viable ones. every unique hero's is left in almost an unplayable state for months at a time until they get a small buff and their win rate goes up so then they are nerfed again within 24 weeks if not instantly which does happen btw maybe because they are so min maxed that any change at all make is such a big deal due to unplayability of the particular hero . while other hero's dominate the meta for half a year or more. that's the other problem they balance around win rate with no regard to what is fun to play or not which is mind blowing to me and the community. if ow1 did not exist this game would have died and nobody would even care. if you don't agree that's cool just look at any outlet that reviews this game or any streamer at all, the state of the esport, canceled content the list goes on. first time ever reviewing any game on metacrtic because i love what ow could be but will never be, i hope they do better."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-06-04,"this is the overwatcheight game of all time, the microtransactions and their care for their players is truly peak game development. my favorite part is when reaper said buy, buy, buy and bought the whole store and going bankrupt big, also i loved when they pulled an extremely elaborate april fools prank by promising us pve then announcing it years later to be mosty cancelled, even though it wasn't on april fools, it was truly the prank of all time."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-30,played this game for like 500 hours i have wasted time its  and i cant do very much when the only factor of winning and losing is my tank bru its not fun to go 34 in 7 but cause ur tanks 15 in 10 you literally cant win games anymore cause you only have 1 tank it a bit depressing to see how much the game has fallen from the best first person shooter to one of the worst in just 2 years its still fun playing with competent friends who are decent but if your looking to play on your own the game will fk you over and over again with  matchups. overall not worth wasting your time on
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-30,"servidores do overwatch  simplismente um lixo! a maioria dos jogos no competitivo cai na metada da partida, o servidor simplismente fecha e voc perde o seu tempo jogando, uma verdadeira falta de respeito com os fs, blizzard decadente"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-15,one of the most boring online fps on the market. palladins is a 1000 times more exciting.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-13,horrendous eomm backed up by complete idiotic support. begging for money in the most possible disgusting way. 010
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-10,theres so much i can say about this game and not in a good way. i feel as if this game constantly ignores player feedback and never does anything right.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-09,"not even starting, because i can't verify that i am human. the verification program is  and not working. how can a game be so bad that i can't even start it, i don't understand i hope blizzard gets nuked"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-08,i try to stay optimistic about this sequel but i sometimes feel like i'm the only one supporting it. i might be fighting a losing battle but i loved the original so i just try to have a positive outlook for this one.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-06,developers of this game should be fired. absolutely boring piece of ...
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-05-01,"overwatch 1 was a great game, it even won a goty. this game is not even a shadow of what the previous one was, in fact, i call it scamwatch 2. from day 1 until today, abusive prices have been maintained in the store, the content for which they let ow1 die turned out to be all a lie and in its place they released a pack of very bad and boring missions in exchange for 3 years of silence and abandonment the balance of heroes is fine, however, the game has a huge problem and for which it is doomed to die sooner or later. the matchmaking of the game is complete infectious garbage, it is totally intervened by blizzard to keep people playing based on negative and positive stimuli. it is programmed to force a 50 win ratio, no matter the player's skill, it is an automated algorithm that will manipulate your games until your ratio is exactly 5050. all games are a stomp, you win or lose, but it is always by stomp.this happens because the system needs to regulate your win rate, so your games are a  festival, boring and frustrating. for 10 seasons, the top has always been the same players, without a single variation, because the game keeps the players stuck in a rank and the same thing happens with the top500, they are always the same, there is no point in trying to climb ranks or improve in this game since nothing depends on you, it is an entire system in the purest slots style this has caused the environment to become more and more toxic, to an unbearable point. people are very frustrated and explode at the slightest comment, it is totally understandable since the system induces that. the problem is that blizzard did not plan all this well, they did not think that there is very good quality competition and that 90 of people would leave their game when they realized that it is a complete scam and is totally rigged. because of this, the game stays alive as best it can, but it will soon die and be forgotten. every day it loses many more players than it wins and it is a matter of time before this happens. blizzard doesn't care, they only want to sell skins, they have made it clear by maintaining this invasive matchmaking system for 10 't play this garbage, if you want a good hero shooter, there are others on the market in which you can demonstrate your skill and the games will depend on being better than the other team, not on a casino style algorithm that decides your games before you start. ow2 is, simply, an insult to the fanbase of its first part,"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,this game was created only to make money and that's horrible. overwatch 2 is a great example how to kill a great game in some simple steps.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-02-10,its a fun multiplayer game with good variety of characters i dont see why its hated so much
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-02-08,"the game is unbalanced in normal nonranked play, and i take no pleasure in playing it. they play with 3 tanks and 2 healers, so it's impossible to  used to be a great game, but since the introduction of the combat pass, it's no fun at all."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-02-07,"it's an absolute shame what they did to this game. it was never going to have the magic the first one did at the beginning and that is fine. but, all of the ideas it had prerelease was promising enough to make a cool sequel focused more on challenges story content. too bad most of that was scarped and the rest put behind a paywall. now you can still play the game, which is fun, but if you are free to play, don't expect to unlock anything worth while as that time has come and gone."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-02-01,skeleton of overwatch one this game has is a prime example of what is wrong with modern media
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-01-25,"this game is the perfect example that videogames companies doesn't like their players, they just want their money and will search for it till they obtain it. the issue about this game is that implements a number of changes and playstyle that doesn't like nobody. the number of players are reduced from 6 to 5, the lootboxes that gives you everytime 3 of 4 different items with different values are now erradicated by a terrible gamepass that doesn't gives rewards your progresion every level at a time, this rewards are only obtained by the premium gamepass so your time invested is not rewarded at every level of progress. the characters are the same and even have been added a few ones but with this woke feeling trying to add the lgbt community just as marketing and the promisess as the missions now are selled separately of course because if you have already paid for a gamepass premium, why not invest even more for the extra content that shoud be already in the game from the beggining. this game was great, now is a gold mine trying to take your money as desperate at this could be. hope this change at some point but, due to blizzards history and problems... i doubt it. sorry, but all this is true."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-01-22,good thing the gameplay is so strong because if not it would be a 0. the game lacks content. monetisation is super aggressive. it just feels like they dislike their player base. awful game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-01-09,"the interface of the game such as weapons, sounds, hitsounds, ability sounds are complete garbage. i have not played the game before, and i had no idea if i was doing damage, or healing somebody, or even doing good  tanks are dying like paper. i remember killing the monke and other tanks with soldier 76 like no  damage characters are okay? like hanzo, and the cowboy dude, and soldier 76 are okay, but gets boring after a while.supports are pretty goodthe lack of tutorial made me puke, the game basically told me, how i move you have abilities and voala now go. bruh i dont even knew the abilities of the characters... i was thinking this game had more. i heard the 2 in overwatch is pretty is much just there. and this blizzard is hungry for money, i'm happy the reviews are what they are. i felt empty after i killed 6 people then i died. it did not have the feeling of ahh is good i did something the most funny moments where, when the team spammed helo for like 20 seconds. the animations are  and tracer has a fat ass thats good!104 tracer made me write 4 instead of 3"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-12-30,"i've played overwatch since 2018. i've never logged more hours on a video game. recent balance issues and poorly designed heroes have made gameplay increasingly boring and frustrating. there is little creativity left when both sides must focus on staying alive instead of making game changing plays. winning in this game is a simple exercise in counter picking or selecting the characters that overtuned e.g., mauga. i often leave feeling more frustrated than satisfied, even if my side is winning. like a toxic relationship, i am planning to cut this game out of my life."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-12-22,"full review unbalanced mess that depends on aim skill, lucky matchmaking pairing with the right players. not enough anti healing to stop bullet sponge tanks with self healing while getting healing making them unkillable. roadhog i find this to be the only character that creepily gets better treatment than any other overwatch character. he one shots everyone personally. from overwatch 1 to 2. his nerves never matter. his rework is a big buff than a nerf. i mean this character is multi talented. i seen him one shot grandmaster to even bronze players these are sometimes main by even noobs. against this character he is far too easy to use to the point there is no fun in playing him. there is not a single game where this character has caused several arguments such as l hog roadhog really  too op whats the point he just won't die etc. this is amazing to see a character invisible to criticism and nerfs on social media conversations. reason? people gave up. some even cheered for it. meanwhile eachother character gets nerf and rework for them to become hardboring to use. when i say special treatment i say creepily special treatment. i seen roadhog catch up to a soldier 76 since you nerfed his sprinting ability, like why was his sprinting a problem? but a hook that reaches heaven fair? healers no words need to be said here except. what type of video game gives immunity as an ability to a support that main focus is to heal. when i say it stands out to be the most annoying. i mean it. it is so unbalanced. even for a second it can change the tide for a battle. i seen a kiriko take out an entire team alone. why does healers a support role do massive headshot damage. i even see them be even more dangerous than dps. free to play for a free to play game. it better be. its a mess a joke. a waste of potential wasted on people that don't know what they are doing with their franchise."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-12-22,"the game is perpetually unbalaced and it feels like the devs put zero effort into asking the community about how they feel about certain changes. i have played around 1k hours and used to love this game, but now i can just feel the neglect that they have given it and the recent characters seem prettly lazily designed talking about mauga. to be honest playing this game for long enough will invariably just make you feel sad and a little angry."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-12-14,highly informal review cuz im too lazy to make an essay on why this game doesn't deserve to be review bombed. the game is very fun and its full of exciting characters and that it actually improved upon the prior game by changing heros and adding more depth into the game the only reason people rate it low is because of what the majority tells them and the poor launch like damn this game is actually good and has millions of dollars and years of work by developers inside of it and just because of the poor launch it was review bombed by valve d riding tf2 worshiping sweats give justice to overwatch2

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-21,"this game is fun. it is a game that is difficult to have fun without cooperation because you can choose a role group and the team's dependence is high. i think the change from 6vs6 to 5vs5 was a bad judgment. switching to the current method inevitably creates a balance problem, but the developer cared about it. so the buff of the tank became big. but this works badly in the mode of choosing a role group with freedom. additionally, various cc skills sleep gun, flash, etc. were fine at 6vs6, but when it came to 5vs5, its power grew. so my balance got bad for a while and i spent time on it. if i kept it at 6vs6, i would have kept the cc skills. i think cc skill in overwatch was fun, too and...rank mode is not fun. to be precise, the player's rank judgment is not interesting. overwatch's rank mode is to win 5 times to get a tier, but if you win 5 times with great difficulty and the tier drops, your loss will only grow. sometimes you've won five times in a row, but sometimes the tier drops. players are offended by this. if you lose, your score will decrease, and if you win, your score should increase. to know this, i need to introduce something that allows me to check my tier score in real time. next is pve. as someone who has played pve himself, the result is disastrous compared to the wait. of course, pve itself is not a bad result, but the price is burdensome because it is sold in 1000 coins. it's not bad if you buy it except for the prices of the coins. however, this is unpleasant that there are only three missions at the current price. the play method is also flat. previously, it included skills, but it was discarded. therefore, maps developed focusing on the use of existing skills seem to have become flat when the skills are gone. this is my personal opinion"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-17,this game is okay. i very much liked the monkey character but other than that its okay i guess.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-13,delete the battlepass and give us pve the only thing good is the corn i have to wite the review 75 character so bla blabla

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-09,"there is literally pornography on the overwatch game menu when you open the game now. they took all of the attractive female heroes, showed as much skin as they could possibly show, and put them in various dominantsubmissive positions . literally disgusting. they gave 2 of the girls 'reaction face thumbnail' smiles with a wide open mouth... something you never see people do in real life. besides that, the game had a 'feel' to it before they added clown heroes like the hamster. now they added a trans hero junker queen, a femboytrans hero, a clearly gay healer guy, another latino chick with a male face even though sombra had that covered, and an independent strong black woman character. this game is woke trash!!!! the graphics feel like fortnite, the sexualization feels like league of legends. you can't even tell what is going on anymore during a game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-07,"in short, this game is a typical heroshooter genre. graphics are good and mechanics are okay. gameplay is not fun as a casual player. heroes are unbalanced especially as a tank imo and optimization countering enemies picks makes the game not fun. most new content is blocked by paid currency and tedious grinding."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-07,"i made this account just to tell you this game is trash. ive only reviewed one game before this and it was crusader kings 3. i dont review games but here we are, i hate this shiddy   game so much. cons  bots in comp  dog tier matchmaking  bots in comp cuz nobody plays this dog game  not fun  why is it called 2, literally nothing was changed other than making it dog water pros  quitting this pos game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-05,"hey there, its me! im here to talk about overwatch 2. let me tell you, this game is a real doozy. the lack of a pve mode has made me feel like im stuck in a neverending cycle of rage and disappointment. it makes me furious and frustrated. im already addicted to destiny 2, and the lack of a pve mode in overwatch 2 has made my life even worse. im so irritable that i sometimes start yelling and screaming in public areas out of nowhere. its gotten so bad that ive even been beaten up once. i was at the local mall, and i had just lost a game of overwatch 2. i was so angry that i started screaming and yelling at the top of my lungs. i was shouting things like i cant believe this game is so bad! and why cant they just add a pve mode?! people were staring at me, and some of them even started laughing. thats when a group of guys came up to me and started beating me up. they said that i was disturbing the peace and that i needed to calm down. they punched me in the face and kicked me in the stomach. it made me feel humiliated and embarrassed. i had to go to the hospital , lets talk about the gameplay. overwatch 2s switch to smaller 5v5 matches ushers in a new brawler age for overwatch where individual duels take precedence over tactical teamplay, and crucially, all but a handful of shields have been thrown out of the arena. it makes me disappointed and frustrated. the game is so focused on aim as the most important and nonlethal abilities are minimized. it makes me angry and disgusted .the music in overwatch 2 is decent, but its nothing to write home about. its not memorable, and it doesnt add anything to the game. it makes me indifferent and unimpressed. now, lets talk about moga. i mean, maui. i dont know why they even added him to the game. hes such an annoying character, and his name isnt even right. it makes me angry and disappointed. i despise him so much. , on the other hand, is much more cool and hot. shes got style, shes got grace, and shes got a giant mech suit. what more could you want? thats not all! once i was playing overwatch 2 in starbucks, and i was doing pretty well. but then, i died, and i lost it. i slammed my laptop shut and threw it into a giant vat of coffee. the people around me were shocked, and some of them even started screaming. one guy even tried to stop me, but i pushed him away. i was so angry that i didnt care what happened. the consequences were dire. my laptop shortcircuited and exploded, and i had to pay for the damages. it made me feel stupid and ashamed. but thats not all. security dragged me out of the starbucks, and i was arrested for disturbing the peace and destruction of property. i had to pay a hefty fine of 300,000 and do three months of probation. it was all because of overwatch 2. it makes me furious and disgusted. and dont even get me started on the predatory battle pass. its a scam, plain and simple. it made me go into debt, and i had to use my fathers credit card to pay it off. i owed the money to blizzard entertainment. it makes me feel hopeless and depressed. i had to work extra hours at my job just to pay off the debt. my family relationships were strained because of it. my dad was furious when he found out that i had stolen his credit card to pay off the debt.overall, i would give overwatch 2 a rating of 2 out of 10. please do not play this game, trust me youll thank me later."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-04,"fuing  of an game.. where is pve ?? why is the battle pass nat self financing, why do i fuing have to pay to play ranked"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-02,"ow2 is a horrible game. the ranking system is all messed up, they actually dont care about their players at all. i have tried to get in contact with someone from blizzard but no chance. so what about the game is wrong? well almost everything. they made promises about pve, which would be playableat launch. it wasnt. in fact the whole game didnt work when they launched it. after that they have small things for players to be tricked into buying stuff in game. not only do we have pve now,but they actually make you pay for every mission u do.when they release a new hero they will make it overpowered as hell to make new players want to buy their skins and battlepass. oh yeah, the battlepass. normally if you buy a battlepass it means you will get some credits back from it so you can buy it again. here at overwatch, we love money more then everything, so we got rid of that. doesnt that make you feel special? spending 10 euros or something everythime for mid skins and all kind of garbage items you will never use. the reporting system is also a fun one. it does not matter if you are toxic or not. if you dont like someone and have 10 other friends its probably less then 10 who play the game, let them report the same guy for having a bad game. that way he will get suspended. i actually played a chill game once, all was well but some guy got mad because i could not heal him when he was doing something. he typed in match chat this guy is racist report him and i got banned the next day. i wasnt even in voice chat and did not speak a word, but i got a ban for 3 weeks. i have played this game for a long long time but for me its over. i actually hate this game and i would not recommend this game to anybody, not even my worst enemies."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-11-02,"detailed review here. now after release of le sserafim stuff i want to do my part by taking the rating where it belongs. i stopped playing just a few months after ow2 release. i bought the preorder pack for 40 , got the first two season passes and played to levels 80. not maximum though. they lied. they lied about the amount of new heroes they promised. they lied about quite everything. when ow2 started getting political with lgbt stuff for csd 2023 was the last string for me. kids play this game and they shouldnt be exposed to their favorite hero being homosexual or trans or whatever. i didnt want to support all the lies and uninstalled. a lot of time passed. one of my favorite kpopgroups le sserafim posted on socials about cooperating with ow2. i. am. hyped. but wait. lul they released the stuff today. 6800 credits for mega pack of everything. either you buy 2200 credits three times for 60  and still dont have enough or you spend 50  for 7500 credits. it used to be 5000 for 50  but you get extra value for a short time. how generous. megapack includes all 5 skins for the 5 members of le sserafim. dance emotes from the choreo of their hitsong antifragile and some other stuff. the emotedance is from the chorus of the song. to compare it with other games where you can find similiar things like this  fortnite. fortnite plays the song with your danceemote. ow2 doesnt. they quietly do some moves and thats it basically. you can buy a single pack for each skin for 2500 credits. includes only 1 skin of your choice and all the other things related to that skinhero. you can also buy the skin only. for 1900 credits. basically blizzard is saying just buy the f 2500 creditpack.! you can buy 2200 credits for 20  and still need to buy 500 credits for another 5 . that leads to making it more profitable to buy the 6800 credit megapack. why buy 2  5 for 2500 each? same amount of money. disgusting. they also introduced a new game mode for the event. with some free stuff you can get. including a free junkrat skin. thats pretty alright. you get the stuff by literally grinding only. youre required to play the new mode. one of the rewards require 60 played games. wins count as 2. its just capture the flag kind of mode with just the new skins. 3 v 3 its pretty boring. i got hyped af and installed the game couple days before start of the event and waited until it started. i play 1 match, won it 2313 and went back to fortnite to get some duo wins and dance to cupid by fifty fifty and had music to my emote. fortnite wins. so. blizzard had a really good opportunity to make some things right. investing in a dead game for such big event to cooperate with le sserafim. they couldve kept it an investment and gave the skins out for free. lets just do some challenges and earn it. they couldve shown that they care. instead theyve shown us once again  they dont f care!  some other reasons for a score of 0 one of the reasons i stopped playing was ranked system. it never worked properly since release of ow2. they promised improvements and more transperancy. it got worse and i got more confused. it doesnt make sense when i play support ana main and got more healing than all the other three support heroes combined and drop because my team lost. example warzone ranked. if you play well individually but end up below top 25 you still might rank up. youre earning sr by doing well. not on ow2. you might be the best player in the match but if your team doesnt win  you drop. nothing they promised before release has been done. thats enough to not play this game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-10-10,"overwatch is one of the most ambitious and creative pr blizzard ever created. it has it all to all the types of creative media, movies, more games, etc. 1010 concept idea. overwatch 1, a full priced game, with free loot boxes, no battle pass, was one of the best games. i've played it for years. gained several skins, many legendaries, just by playing. it was one of the games i've played the most for years. then blizzard butchered overwatch 1 and resurrected it with the name 'overwatch 2'. as an undead game, that came from a living game, the undead is inferior. no more free loot boxes, no more free nothing, cash grab everywhere, every skin is pricey, with the scammy money grab strategies to always make you have some coins in your overwatch wallet. not even the only promise that would make ow2 different, and worth a try, pve, got butchered too. blizzard corpos saw that ow1 would not generate more profit then created ow2 to go full profit cash grab mode. overwatch 2 was the nails in the coffin. diablo 4 is the burying the end of blizzard. now is just activision bob's profit machine."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-10-10,"what's sad is an easily abusable reporting system. like literally asking someone who is feeding and blocking team progression to switch, or assist will get you a report. if someone so much as says that they cried in response to anything you said or typed is insane. not to get me started on the fact if you aren't the type of person to speak in game you can also be reported for that by butthurt people on comp."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-07,"lackluster and dissapointing sequal to a respected franchise. awful and greedy monetization. unnecessary removing content, just for the sake of it. the delivery of pve content is nothing sort of a disaster."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-10-03,"really hate to rank this game so low but it's unfortunately well deserved. overwatch truly is the face of corporate greed, blizzard has succeeded in turning a once loved game into a complete cash grab. the only way this earned 3 stars is due to the base game still remaining."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-10-02,"the game isn't what blizzard promised to us. i started playing overwatch on the playstation 4 back in 2017. i loved the game and i would play it everyday. the characters were interesting, the lore was fun and gamemodes and maps were really good, it was overall a good game. overwatch started to go for the worse in 2019 in my opinion after the announcement of ow2. blizzard quickly stopped updating the original ow but we kept playing in hopes that ow2 would be the best game of the century. they promised us a pve campaign that was highly replayable, character missions and loads of new heroes and maps. when overwatch 2 released we got 3 new heroes, a few new maps and a new gamemode. they said they would release the pve later. about 4 months ago the overwatch 2 team announced that the pve woudn't infact be a highly replayable campaign story mode like we were promised. this is what ultimately killed overwatch. we patiently waited for years to get pve with hope that it would revive the game. but that moment never came. i've spent countless hours in this game. i've had fun. the game has had ups and downs but i still loved the game. overwatch 2 isn't the game i fell in love with. overwatch 1 is. i believe this game will be dead in a years time. this game was what made me fall in love with gaming. but it's about time for it to die. after season 6 my time with this game that i hold very dear to me will be over. goodbye ow you were there for me in when i had no one to talk to. and another great game falls for the greedyness of blizzard and the gaming industry. overwatch, you will be remembered. rest in peace, the best game there ever was,"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-10-02,"everything i want to say has already been said. i want to like this game, i do, i truly think the pvp is in a good spot. but i will not play or support a game that has only been made for money. all ow2 is, is a monetization underhaul, a system so awful people want loot boxes back. it's not all bad news, congratulations paladins, you won."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-29,"souless version of overwatch 1. removed everything enjoyable about the game and focused on cashgrabs.i have about 2000 hours on overwatch 1. we saw the changes ruining the game toward the end of the  got worse with overwatch 2. worse part? the only reason for overwatch 2, accoding to blizzard, was a sprawling pve mode in which players could level up and play with friends to immerse into the overwatch world. this was the main selling point for about 3 years... after relase blizzard, literaly, laughed and said they actually stopped devoloping 2 years before the release of overwatch 2. this game is just garbage. blizzard took the best pvp game to ever exist, and will ever exist, and gutted it into a mindless cash grab.blizzard is dead  they did the same thing with diablo 4"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-21,its just the 1st game and doesn't even justify it having a 2 at the end
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-19,"new players are the lifeblood of any live service game, but overwatch 2 is extremely unfriendly to anyone who is not a veteran player. from the games lack of new content to its gradual decline that began with some of the design decisions in the original overwatch, overwatch 2 can be seen as nothing but a downgrade from the game released back in 2016. overwatch was an amazing game. the gameplay is some of the best i have ever played in a firstperson shooter. the art and character design are flawless. this truly is a game that has so much content simply due to the depth of design of the individual characters and the nuances of their gameplay. sadly, though, the game has failed to continue taking steps to innovate upon its initial gameplay loop. content was withheld for years to make way for a pve mode that never saw the light of day and many overwatch fans did not care about in the first place. additionally, the game has been extremely hard for new players to get acclimated to due to the competitiveness of the game, partially because of a high ratio of veteran players to new players, but this can also be blamed on the addition of rolequeue into the baseline game. the game used to be about playing who you want to play when you want to play them, which led to the ability to flex to different roles and characters to counter the enemy comp. whacky comps would be a norm within the matches which led to more varied gameplay. the argument for rolequeue for competitive play will always be there, but overall, this addition feels like the most prominent turning point in the negative direction for the overall state of the game and its appeal to new players. it feels like blizzard lost sight of their original vision for the game. in short, overwatch 2 is a blunder on the part of blizzard, and it is a lesson of mismanagement of one of the greatest ips launched in the past decade. for new players out there, i recommend steering clear of this game. overwatch was one of the most fun and polished games to ever be released in the fps genre, but that masterpiece has been long gone."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"tinha tudo pra reviver o overwatch, mas s piorou. rotao de mapas ruim, preo absurdo nas skins, sem as caixas que todo mundo amava, enfim, a blizzard tinha a faca e o queijo na mo e resolveram jogar o queijo no lixo e enfiar a faca onde no deve. 310"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-11,"when overwatch came out years ago i automatically fell in love with the game. it was my first fps game, over the years the game just got worse and worse to the point in which it was not fun anymore, so i eventually stopped playing. when overwatch 2 was announced i took it with a grain of salt since blizzard is as smart as a rock in the desert. the disconnect between the people in charge and the consumer is obvious and of course the same can be said about overwatch 2. now you have to once again pay more money in order to get the pve they talked so much about even though some of us paid 60 for a game that became free to play. lastly, does anyone remember the team making feature, taking it off was a stupid decision."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-11,i'm just waiting the sad death of blizzard now. bobby killed you my friend.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-09,i would never recommend this game as there is no reward for a nonbattle pass purchaser to obtain. the level system is tied to the bp so that's pointless. the comp ranking system is also trash. i got bronze 4 in ow 1 and when i went to do my placements with 410k hrs under my belt 50 win loss i still got bronze 4. terrible game. i would recommend everyone to download it on steam and get your free achievements on your steam account. delete the game then leave a negative review.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"holy  i bought this game in early 2019. it was one of the most fun games i've ever played. ow was the game i had spent most hours on. but it started to decline. ow 2 is one of the most scummy things i have seen a comnpany do. first of all. they don't give you a choice to even play ow 1 anymore, which i enjoyed a whole lot more. but the thing was, there was gonna be a pve in the new, fresh version. which hyped up the whole community. of course, they cancelled it and focused on the pvp modes instead. what a dumb decision. then still choosing to release three missions for 15 dollars. the f2p is just scummy aswell. in ow1 if you just played consistantly you would get rewards such as skins, emotes etc. none of that is anymore, requiering you to pay about a quarter of the original game for 1 skin. somehow if you play ranked it feels like this. winning for about 5 seconds you feel good after the torture, then not even seeing you rating go up, demoralizing you. losing feels  horrible. in every game you lose it feels like you couldn't have done anything.  horrible game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-09,"blizzard has released a quick cash grab, promised players a lot, delivered none of that. they literally said that they would release pve, then said they won't but will give players some pve coop missions. then they put those behind a paywall. overwatch 2 is just the same as overwatch 1, except more aggressive monetization and less good content added."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-09-02,looking at it for the gamemodes and gunplay aspect it hits the spot when needed. but due to blizzards poor management of the title. and failed and false promises it becomes hard to see what is rather then what could have been. still enjoy the game but could be infinitely better.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-31,"blizzard has done what no other developer could. make the most hated, hollow game update by removing features and calling it '2'."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-31,"i like the game, but i dont like what has happened to it, i mean the dissapointment hearing that the skill tree was removed and that the pve costs was horrible, but the missions are good, id say worth the 15 well some might say, but everything else is good and the game is perfectly balanced except illari and wifeleaver but an ok game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-31,"overwatch 2... overwatch season 2 would be appropriate, the quality of the game is the same. it's not that the game isn't good, but there's no reason for people who quit after 1 to come back."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-31,took away the original to force the player base to move. reworked characters are a let down for the most part. some positive changes in my opinion as well. launch was poorly handled. but overall you took a beloved game and turned it into a cash grab. blizzard this game will never get another cent from me personally.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-31,this game has a  matchmaking like the game itself. they ruined overwatch 1
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-29,"triste saber que uma pessoa que tem mais de 300 horas de jogo no consegue sair do ouro 1 por conta de matchmaking. meus tanks e dps no fazem nada e muitos at podem falar que sou ruim e no sei oque, mas e impossvel eu ficar ruim se no consigo subir de tank, e acabo sempre carregando o time de suporte. no entendo como o matchmaking consegue fazer pessoas que nem conseguem matar ninguem. uma dica para melhorar o matchmaking seria tipo um voto s que ao contrrio,tipo quando voc v uma pessoa que voc acha que tem que ser de uma patente a baixo voc vai e d esse voto assim o jogo entenderia que ele deveria estar em um rank a baixo"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-29,"in 2016 i bought a game overwatch 1. in 2022 without my consent, they come to crush me a game bought to transform it into fre to play with an appellation 2 while we are at the level of a patch and a socalled redesign while it is only filters applied on game. i'm very angry, the 5 vs 5 brings nothing except a greater absence of tank and heal in the games except when a character becomes meta thanks to a patch up, there is also less and less fewer cards, but where are the ow 1 cards??? if you want to make an ow2, already your first gesture is to give community tools to make maps, when at the start you copied everything from team fortres 2 except the creation object... here in august 2023 we can say that there is no longer any gm or observer or complaint controller, the players are as toxic as possible and i don't even throw stones at them because it's because of this what has become of the game, but hey there's the total, it ticks all the boxes homophobia, racism, disability and of course moms... i will add the worst of the worst of all the unimaginable battles pass, free players while you paid for 1 only receive poop, it's shameful. i won't even go to the pve mode in the road map which disappears because beiiii they don't give a  and i even wonder if it wasn't already planned not to make any to be able to sell a kit at high prices rotten missions. personally i'm not complaining that there is no pve in any case i don't put a dollar on boat mission purchases because we are logically in a competitive fps which has nothing to do with pve. it's time microsoft came along to clean up this mess."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-28,"overwatch 2 is basically a stripped down version of the original game with egregious monetization, less customer support, and an even worse community than overwatch. there is no hope for this game, it's community or blizzard as a company. stay as far away from this game as you can."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-28,its ok.....................................................................
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-27,i want overwatch back which i paid for and invested in. part 2 is trash in all aspects. play solitaire and have more fun.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-27,this game isn't even worth the 75 character minimum so i'm going to just say random things.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-25,"knew for months that story mode was canceled, and still lied and announced it anyway. stole the game i liked and payed for and replaced it with a much inferior version with same  balancing. i loved playing tank duos. gone now. imagine if dev just straight up removes 1 of 5 classes from a game. took away features like on fire bar and congratulated themselves for bringing them back. what is this nonsense."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-24,they deleted the game i liked and gave me a worse one to capitalize on the battlepass trend. not a review bomber. been playing since overwatch 1 came out. this game is dissapointing.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-24,it's clear that blizzard has no idea what they're doing. they scrapped the whole reason they said why they were replacing overwatch with overwatch 2. the characters are terribly imbalanced and the monetization is terrible. overwatch 2 is a huge waste of time.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-23,"pay to win garbage. jeff kaplan wasn't perfect, but this game makes it seem like he was."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-23,"greedisgood 999999. blizzard, you  up warcraft reforged, no  you will continue to  up the rest of your games. i have played ow2 with a few friends that have tried ow1 and from what they said and what i saw on yt, ow2 should've just been an update. the reason why it is called ow2 is bs and they will charge you for that kind of bs."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-23,"the first overwatch holds a special place in my heart but this, this is just a desperate money grab for a game on its last breath due to a poor development team and company. honestly i was willing to look past multiple years of no development and care for overwatch 1 cause at the end of the day we'd be getting loads of new features and pve but no they acted as if they didn't have multiple years to even scarp together some halfassed story i'm 100 certain that if you gave a bunch of 12 year olds the same access to all the tools and resources the overwatch team has they could of at least put together 1 tiny campaign, but at the end of the day i really hoped that they'd at least try but no, guess corporate greed always wins. 010"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-23,blizzard is dead. the only products they deliver now are monetisation scams. play baldurs gate instead!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-22,trash................mmmmmmmm.....................................................
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-22,"i bought overwatch when it first came out. it was fun and enjoyable. i was excited for overwatch 2, but it seems that all the things that hooked me in tbr first one is just gone. they replaced my purchase of overwatch with a worse version of a free to play game. what a pity"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-22,terrible choice to remove overwatch 1 it was a better game. also failure of not delivering promised content.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"the game is one big money grab, also if you have bad internet and you have a disconnect, there is no option to return to game which results in bans overtime, the whole experience is so bad.. only thing what is solid is the gameplay. but it's ruined by activision."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"i bought whatever prerelease pack they offered for overwatch 2, then realized there was no pve, and the pvp game was exactly the same as overwatch 1. i think i logged in to play about 3 times during season 1. my premium battle pass might have been leveled to level 5 or so out of around 100 levels. i heard they made the skins paywall only at some point. it felt like a scam. i will never play overwatch again."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"i played overwatch 1 since 2017 and was originally very excited for ow2. i was so unbelievably disappointed with the stale gameplay and unrewarding monetization system. it seems so pointless to play this game, but at least there was this bright star in the sky the story mode. yeah me and my friends were extremely excited for the story mode since it was announced, and finding out they canceled it and made some weak, boring ow1 type of story missions out of it was the last straw that broke the camel's back for me. 010 would not recommend! also i think its funny to see blizzard trying to play victim for getting bad reviews"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"i was a huge fan of the original overwatch, so i was excited for overwatch 2. however, i was very disappointed with the final product. the biggest problem with overwatch 2 is the expensive transactions. the game is free to play, but all new heroes and cosmetics are locked behind a premium battle pass. this is a major turnoff for many players, especially those who are used to the more generous monetization system of the original overwatch. another major problem with overwatch 2 is the lack of new content. the game only has two new modes push and colosseum. push is a new objectivebased mode but very similar to the existing escort mode. colosseum is a 4v4 deathmatch mode, but it is not very exciting. the original overwatch also had a lot of great story content, but overwatch 2 does not have any story mode. this is a major disappointment for many fans who were looking forward to more lore and character development. overall, i am very disappointed with overwatch 2. the game is a major step back from the original regarding content and monetization. i would not recommend this game to anyone."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"blizzard is going down a deep hole and it will be terribly difficult for them to climb back out. companies spend millions and still so difficult to get an engaged audience, and they're throwing it all away for a quick buck.. good luck in the future but for me, that's 1 customer signing out"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"its called overwatch 2 because they removed maps, loots boxes, free skins, in game currency, 1 team member from each team, old ranking system, ingroup indicator while inmatch, the level based progression system, arcade incentives, statistics preseason 31 and all cosmetics suffered a massive increase in cost and canceled pve. how can u not get this??? best update ever!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-21,"its so exciting to see, how a behemoth of goodness can fall so low. what a time to be alive"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-20,"it used to be such a great game. overwatch was truly a phenomenon. but someone got greedy and decided that sacrificing the golden goose for immediate profit would somehow not kill it. i give it a 4 out of respect for what it used to be. if you are oblivious to everything that happened, you might even enjoy it a bit."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-20,"the game shamefully died from the greediness of blizzard. you were supposed to destroy sith, not join them."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-20,"they took a good game, for which users spent 40 on release and completely destroyed it... robbing anyone who purchased overwatch of the product they paid for as well as the original promise to always release new heroes for free."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-19,"have you ever spent 20 minutes thinking to yourself, what the hell were people thinking? why did they think this would be a good idea? who thought other human beings would be on board with this? well, that's overwatch 2. the first game wasn't perfect, but it was fine. who the living christ thought it would be a good idea to slap a 2 in front of this game's title is far, far beyond me. uuuggghhh... this isn't a sequel, it's just a large update. the pointless 2 is just pretty much a tactic to rope people in. oh yeah, now you get to pay for new heroes! oh boy, how exciting!! it was so inconvenient to get free fun updates of new heroes, skins and gamemodes, now people get to drain their bank accounts for them. a fullyfledged coop mode was planned to be part of this... sequel... which a huge reason why people were interested in the game, and then out of nowhere, the idea gets scrapped, so now gamers feel this huge, crippling gut punch of disappointment. great, now we're left with an unlikable pay2win game. yes, coop missions were added, but it doesn't make up for all the game's mistakes. a majority of players felt that the first game was fine as is, now we're all forced to play what's essentially overwatch 1.3. in other words, something that feels like a permanent dlc you can't turn off. there are a few positives, like one tank being playable instead of two, which speeds up games a bit although that one's a bit controversial, and there are a few balance tweaks to some characters, but at the same time, some were given changes that ruined them and made them unfun to play."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-19,i bought 5 copies of overwatch 1. which blizzard stole from me which is illegal. they lied to all of us that overwatch 1 would continue to exist separately to the very last moment. since we don't have the game anymore everybody should ask activision blizzard for a complete refund. overwatch 2 has no reason of existence other then money they lie about being unable to turn back the clock. and hope people believe it everything is behind a paywall battle passed . there are no features overwatch 2 are promised and the leftover stuff actually costs you a hefty price. blizzard is no more ban buying all games with monetisation like this from this company start a class action lawsuit as activision blizzard crossed the law by stealing every copy of overwatch 1
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-18,no balance. and the one of two reasons to please number 2  large pve content and full story comparing  was cancelled after 5 empty years.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-18,there is a game that plagues the pc a sequel to a once beloved title but now it is a source of misery with roots that can be traced back to the bible. overwatch 2 is what they call this curse a product of activision blizzard's greed they took the original and made it worse and filled it with more bugs than a rabbit could breed the lord has sent this game as punishment for all the sins that this company has done they have exploited workers and players alike and ruined the fun for everyone so heed this warning and avoid this game or else you will regret it and feel shame
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-18,"imagine having a plan to monetize a popular game and create the following leak and claim that there will be a massive pve overwatch game with tons of content, skill trees, gear and stuff almost like destiny. hype people up with fake influencers and tease overwatch 2. then you release the same exact game again, remove a tank and monetize it like a chinese gacha game. claim that the only reason for ow2 to exist never was a thing and sell three 15 minute missions for 40 bucks with a battlepass. this is not even dark patterns anymore like in all other games from abk this is straight up psychological warfare against the community. if i can cancel my 18 year old wow sub and uninstall everything from this company... you can do the same. don't support a company that hates you."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-17,i only gave this game a 0 because negative values aren't an option. horrible rehash of an old dead game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-16,blizzard ate my firstborn.............................................................................
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-16,"the highest score i can give this game is zero. i think blizzard is no longer talented, and the next game they release will be crap again."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-16,im sorry to give such a low grade but i can not give more for a sad reskin where they deluded players with dynamics ever developed. from a nice game they made it a very sad money grabbing machine
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-16,"micro transaction. over micro transaction and over micro transaction again and again. pve announced to be free years ago. actually, locked behind a paywall for 3 half assed cameo short stories."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-16,"i bought ow1 retail, one of the best tactical shooters ever. then blizzard ruined it by replacing it with ow2 freetoplay. ow2 still is an ok game, but ow1 was a great game, better in every aspect. therefore, as a retail customer i feel betrayed by less gameplay, less balance and less rewards in ow2. i understand that blizzard has to make profits, but it would have been better if they had just added a battlepass to ow1 instead of crippling gameplay, balance and rewards with ow2."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-16,just a greedy game original was better in every way possible blizzard just made a cheap way of making money
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,"if even blizzard has given up on the game, i don't think anyone else should insist. i thought it was fun when i tried to play and it all looked pretty cool! the matchmaking was kind of messed up, but that's become a standard for activision blizzard games. let this game die already, while someone somewhere may still remember it as a good game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,"ow1  ow2 is a downgrade where they made it free to play so they could include more microtransactions. the game is fun, but 6v6 ow1 was better. it's sad to see actiblizzard take advantage of a community that loves the game to extract money out of them. and the executives making the decisions just let the devs take all the heat. they are passionate and created an amazing game, but were forced to turn it into this monstrosity where the content they were excited to implement was canceled and the only thing they got to add was a shop and battlepass. 3 skins could have purchased ow1, and ow1 had a way to earn all skins in game. now the only way to earn anything is by grinding out weekly quests for a max of 60 per week."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,"one of the worst games on the market. the will spend a season balancing hero's, and then complety screw it up the next season where you have new medics introduced, that you can only play if you buy the season pass, whom regularly get top damage and top heals by several thousand points. for a aaa game, you really have to completely thick, or just drunk at the wheel to allow this to happen. oh, and the pve is garbage."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,"can i have the rest of my game, please? rip. can i have the rest of my game, please? rip."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,"terrible game. false promises, false advertising, major balance issues, pve paywall, terrible communication, horrendous updates"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,j'en ai marre de blizzard avec des jeux rempli de microtransaction et en plus le jeu bug
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-14,this is not a new game at all. just a another version of the previous one with expensive skins and battlepass. god i wish blizzard hired new developers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"1. you bought overwatch 1. it was nice. 2. blizzard deletes ovewatch 1 without asking its playerbase for opinions or views despite knowing people paid for it. it then replaces it with a better overwatch 2 game promising loads of content and pve playstyle dynamics 3. blizzard locks many new characters and features behind battlepassseason pass paywalls. 4. blizzard removes pve content despite knowing that they had planned to remove it but did not convey to its players before replacing overwatch 1. 5. blizzard charges every bit of content, including its new pve content which only spanned a few short hours. 6. servers and queue time are still suffering. 7. more battlepasses and paywalls to come. screw this. this game is daylight robbery and a boxful of empty promises and shoddy content. if ii were to find a reallife example for this game, would be a vending machine with different cosmetics. you keep throwing your wallet to blizzard while playing silly and badly designed content."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"game is absolutely ass dont play it, completley unbalanced characters and blizzard buffs them instead of nerfing them"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"this is the first game sold to us all over again with 5v5 instead of 6v6 for team comps, new maps that are questionably enjoyable, new characters that aren't automatically unlocked like the original, and a ton of cosmetics locked behind a paywall that is way more expensive than the original loot box system. except now they additionally allow cross play amongst pc, playstation and xbox players  but if you don't want to allow cross play since players keep dropping in and out of games at a high enough rate that the round is unenjoyable, you can spend more than 20 minutes waiting for a game to load. the game is essentially dead."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"when blizzard announced overwatch 2, the gaming community was abuzz with anticipation. overwatch, with its colorful roster of characters and fastpaced gameplay, had cemented its place as one of the premier firstperson shooters of its time. the sequel promised more a fresh layer of depth with pve player vs. environment content and an expansion on the already rich lore. but did it live up to the hype? pve content  a missed opportunity one of the standout features blizzard highlighted for overwatch 2 was its pve content. however, upon release, it quickly became evident that this aspect of the game was not as fleshed out as many had hoped. the missions felt repetitive, lacking the depth and variety that would justify a fullpriced sequel. financial concerns the decision to release a sequel rather than updating the original overwatch with new content raised eyebrows. to many fans, it felt like a calculated move to extract more money, especially those who had invested heavily in the original title, both financially and in terms of time spent. familiarity breeds contempt while sequels are expected to retain core elements from their predecessors, overwatch 2 often felt more like an expansion pack than a fullfledged sequel. the gameplay mechanics, while still solid, didnt offer much innovation. the line between familiar comfort and stagnant repetition became blurred. technical issues postlaunch, players reported various bugs and glitches that, while not gamebreaking, were significant enough to detract from the overall experience. for a sequel from a seasoned developer like blizzard, such oversights were unexpected and disappointing. a mixed bag of updates while some heroes got intriguing redesigns and skill tweaks, others felt untouched or even unbalanced. this inconsistency made the meta feel uneven, impacting the competitive scene and casual play alike. communication breakdown one of the enduring criticisms was blizzard's perceived lack of transparent communication regarding their vision for the sequel, postlaunch plans, and addressing community feedback. given the passionate overwatch community, this perceived silence felt like a snub. in conclusion, while overwatch 2 did bring some new content to the table, it faltered in areas that mattered most to its dedicated player base. the decision to release it as a separate title, especially with its steep price point, left many feeling shortchanged. the sequel, instead of elevating the franchise to new heights, serves as a cautionary tale about understanding and respecting a game's community and their expectations."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"false promises, false advertising, major balance issues, pve paywall, terrible communication, horrendous updates"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,i paid for overwatch! i bought the delux version! then you deleted my game! and gave me some other game i did not pay for i did not ask for it! i want my game back i paid for! you cash grabbing! rugg pulling bitconneeeeect wassa waasssa wassa scammers! how dare you blatantly steal from me! give me my god dam game back you  theiving rat
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"microtransaction hell, only company that gives you a middle finger with a smile and ice cream. how you gone kill the pve than add some of it back but for 15 bucks a mission??  them ann absolute shame."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"when i heard that ow2 will be free to play, i was excited. however the microtransactions that were put to compensate for the free to play nature of this game are soo sad. this game has no soul, it is fun to play but not to be taken too seroiusly."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"i am being generous with the 2 as this is the most shameless videogame moneygrab released this year, and that is saying something. game is also almost unplayable in its current state."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"nothing significant enough has been added or changed to the better to justify a rerelease and about four years of original overwatch release having almost no updates besides trying to force cybersports onto the playerbase. highly marketed huge pve campaign  the most compelling reason for a rerelease of the game, has first been delayed, to not be delivered in a promised form. instead, now we are looking at 15 small mission packs with little to none replayability, no additional features such separate pve character progression with a perk system etc. though the whole point of releasing ow2 as it turned out was the introduction of predatory f2p monetization with a fomoinducing battle pass that not only includes cosmetics but limits access to new playable characters as well, and also an addition of premium cosmetics store with absurdly high prices. even lootboxes from the first game don't look so bad in comparison to this. updated character designs, made to reflect the changes that happened to them in a nonexistent story that was going on in the background somewhere, were simply overloaded with unnecessary details, became less readable and lost their former charm. not to mention that it was yet another botched launch of an actiblizz title with unstable server connection for every region and awfully long queues to enter the game, frequently reported issues with transferring progress from the first game, as well as questionable decisions, such as the need to bind a phone number in order to play. overall, even if most of those things will be fixed eventually and the dev team somehow manages to ship meaningful content updates regularly so far, it still doesn't look so good according to community feedback, i don't see why this game is worth anyone's time all things considered."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,prime example of shrinkflation and a epitome of todays endless corporate greed.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-13,"as a diehard fan of the original overwatch, i was both excited and apprehensive about overwatch 2. unfortunately, my initial impressions were far from stellar, as the game seems to have stumbled into several pitfalls that have left me disappointed and longing for the glory days of its predecessor. one glaring issue that's hard to ignore is the ongoing balancing problem that seems to have carried over from the first game. while overwatch 1 had its share of character imbalances, i had hoped that overwatch 2 would take this opportunity to finetune the gameplay experience. instead, i've encountered an even more frustrating cycle of overpowered heroes dominating matches and a lack of meaningful adjustments to address these problems. the lack of progress on this front is both baffling and frustrating, and it significantly detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game. microtransactions and the implementation of a battle pass system are two more bitter pills to swallow in overwatch 2. the game's transition towards a more aggressive microtransaction model, with an emphasis on cosmetic items locked behind paywalls, feels like a betrayal of the player base that made the original game a hit. the battle pass system, a cash grab that has become all too common in modern gaming, feels like a thinly veiled attempt to extract more money from players for content that should be included in the base game. what makes these monetization strategies particularly infuriating is the stark contrast to the more consumerfriendly approach of overwatch 1. in the original game, cosmetic items were obtainable through gameplay, and the progression system felt rewarding and fair. the shift towards squeezing players for every last penny has tarnished the reputation of a franchise that once prided itself on its commitment to players. speaking of overwatch 1, the inevitable comparison between the two games is hard to avoid. it's clear that overwatch 2 has lost some of the magic that made the original a sensation. the sense of balance, camaraderie, and excitement that defined the first game is sorely missing. overwatch 1 managed to strike a delicate equilibrium between hero abilities and team dynamics, creating a gameplay experience that was both strategic and exhilarating. overwatch 2, on the other hand, seems to have veered off course, sacrificing the essence of what made its predecessor great."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,"i created a metacritic account just so i can give this once beloved and nostalgic game a proper 010 review. if i could, i would've scored it a 10. i've made friends through ow1, i sunk in over 1k hours into the game. it was the first game i played competitively in. i have fond memories of my interactions and random banters, i was excited by each new patch and content ... however, they decided to rebrand an already existent game and slapped a number 2 at the end of the title. the money hungry company switched to a f2p model and removed any chance of acquiring cosmetics through gameplay. sure, they changed some maps, changed the team comp from 6v6 to 5v5, and changed up the rank system but it feels like a patch rather then a new game. then they have the audacity to charge 15 for a pve that was promised but never delivered. the best way i can describe this feeling would be when you just washed your car and then a bird took a fat smelly thick dump on your window. while the friend you were picking up comes into the car with mud all over their shoes. smh blizzard, smh."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,"this game ruined everything about shooters, not only is it a copy with added abilities of two famous games on steam but also blizzard is super greedy, not giving its users the full game, they promised. i could only play for a few hours and the fun ended. there's nothing else. and if you want an extra hour of gameplay, there's a paywall of 15 dollars to play it. that's just so dumb. thank you for nothing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,"i never knew a game could make me want to kill myself, then i played overwatch this game is so  i had more enjoyment watching the overwatch porn then actually playing the game. some of the heroes are so overpowered it makes me wonder if the developers happened to be high on meth when they created the heroes"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,"p2w garbage. diablo 4 is a better game blizzard made, but even then i gave that garbage a 210. blizzard is a big l in my books i wont be buying anymore blizzard games, ive lost all hope for blizzard. until i see a better game experience on twitch ill be moving on from all blizzard games. they need to change back to the good old days. blizzard north!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,"i purchased overwatch 1 and blizzard removed it from my account and forced me to play a game that was exactly the same but with less content as you have to pay for extra. overwatch 2 was launched without pve but they had time to put a battle pass and micro transactions. then they cancelled pve which was the only difference with overwatch 1. blizzard then put a post in a blog bullsing people about the reasons they cancelled pve. we know they never had the intention to put pve now, all they wanted was to force a gacha model to a paid game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,"absolutely appalling how big a scumbag corporation blizzard is and how poorly this crap flopped on them when they somehow expected this scheme to work. steam reviews make me glad to have switched from console to a pc gamer. i highly doubt it but maybe, just maybe this will teach blizzards braindead management a lesson in messing with gamers ps this is a good way to tell which critic sites to never listen to, if they give this p.o.s. a good score you know just how corrupt they are and exactly where they stand on the truth as well as where their funding comes from"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-12,blizzard would be one of the most legendary gaming companies if he got hit by a meteorite in 2016. blizzard would be a sadly missed gaming company if it got hit by a meteorite in 2018. blizzard will be a sorry gaming company if it gets hit by a meteorite in 2020. blizzard will be a good meteorite if it gets hit by one this year.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"for all the time and money i've spent trusting you, it's the least i can do to give you the props you actually deserve. uninstalled for the first time ever, it will never be installed again. i hope blizzard will disappear altogether, it's a joke of a studio, you people make ubisoft look good. as someone nailed it in their steam review the people who make overwatch orn work harder than the people who work on overwatch. says it all."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,just take back overwatch 2 from steam and give me diablo 2 resurrected!!!!!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"overwatch 2 is the same game as the first one except all new content is fairly bad. the missions just released and they are incredibly underwhelming, they feel exactly like halloween and other free events that have any pve and they are just as long if not shorter. i truly have no idea how blizzard can make free content for the game that's better than the paid content . they give you a lot of extra stuff because they know the missions would not be worth anything on its own."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"ow2 started as a bait and switch, and has lingered in a disguised beta for 10 months. game polish was completely ignored for the sake of maximizing mtx sales. this franchise has changed from blizzard's recent darling to a zombie husk to satisfy the income of corporate board members. not to mention the company abused staff one person died by suicide during all of ow1. any positive critics have it wrong. this a soulless title, built from greed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"absolutely incredible, overwatch 2. you've become the lowest reviewed game on steam"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"watch?vhachq41muhu i'll just leave it here, that was your rank!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"so ow2 came out on steam the other day, everyone hates it as expected. i would even dare say ow porn is way more worked on than the game itself lol. this game first, is not a sequel, not at all, just same game with updated graphics and more money based. remember the lootboxes? god it was fun grinding for the legendary skins, it's why people played a lot of competitive, you could practically get 2 legendary skins a week if you were a diehard grinder. in this game, grind for 8  months straight with no day missed else you gotta wait an extra day, and school exists people, it's gonna keep you busy. secondly this game's balancing is the worst thing ever, they just roll the dice on a cup with a character and buff them by whatever number the dice rolls. there were many games with fair balancing and good multiplayer, like team fortress 2 actually listened to it's fans and nerfed almost every weapon to the point where everyone can enjoy playing. meanwhile this game's devs, they are not even trying at all. and hell the coop missions are here but you need to spend 15 extra euros for that. the devs have no remorse and no shame, they kept saying they were excited to bring the game to us, yeah they were excited to steal our money if that makes more sense. seriously, if this game could've had 6 years of development like tf2 had for 9 years, it would've been hot  this game deserves a 110 for me, for the simple fact that it can run. have a good day to you all. p.s this game is so dog that even miniherino director's cut is better lol"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"it does not work with 5v5, it's extremely frustrating to play now, there used to be a push pull to the game with 2 tanks now there is an extreme precure on healers and the tank, if either a healer or the tank dies, everyone dies... gunplay is still good game looks better in some aspects. microtransactions, just to get new heroes is insane, 5v5 fundamentally doesn't work, ranked is broken i was a diamond player in ow 1 and in ow 2 i now have to work from bronze and up with broken team synergies and even when carrying a team when i have 40 kills 15 deaths in my games, team has 15 at most and the healers are at 20.00 healing but somehow bronze is still the rank that is reached. people are flaming healers for not being able to heal fast enough even when they are spamming, because 1 tank can't tank enough which also puts precure on everyone else, and some people are just don't understand that they need to use cover and corners to stay alive, but the game is still fundamentally broken because it wasn't made for it. 010 i really tried to play this game and love it like i did 1 but i give up, it's just not fun anymore, if only they had the option to still play ow1 'c update so after royally  up the game they have now in 2023 announced that the main reason for overwatch 2 which is the pve that was promised is now cancelled, so yeah they should have kept the the game as it was and just added visual updates, heroes, maps and such instead of removing the systems that worked and then left the entire player base disappointed and lied to, people spent their money and time on this game only to get shafted by bad decision, planning and false promises."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"literally only reason to add number 2 to game, pve was dropped after release  turned paid game to f2p screwing people who bought it  borderline p2w, due to new characters being behind paywall you can get them through achivements sometimes too, thats why ive written borderline  good fanmade animations"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,bought this game 2 years ago and i just want to cry! give my money back because this piece of  called overwatch 2 isn't what i bought in 2020
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"let's start with the fact that the game is ruled by the lgbt community and tries to impose it on its audience in every possible way. pve in the game is terrible and it feels very strongly that the game was made not with love, and on the sod. and the price of course for this game is too high."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,just a reminder that ow2 cancelled the only reason it was called as 2nd entry in the series  single player content. this moment alone deserves 010
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-11,"the game is fun, especially for new players. old players from ow 1 are angry for some reasons. as a player who started on season 5 i find it amazing amd engaging and fun to play. season 6 looks cool as well."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-10,"game is worse in every way possible than the first. smaller teams, faster combat, character abilities matter less. character changes that had to be done to try to balance smaller teams just made the characters a shell of their former self. blizzard just chasing the dragon of other games instead of doing their tried and true method of taking something already done and making it better. they took their own game and made it worse. also it's hilarious that after all the memes and such about the game that it was literally a patch over overwatch 1 that just removed all the good stuff. it's a glorified scuffed fan mod thats worse in every single imaginable way."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-10,free  with paid missions. the first part is better. i paid only for 3 mission and that's not enough
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-10,this game had so much potential i was a big fan of the first one but this game is an funny excuse . the only thing they actually did in this sequel is they removed old features just to bring them back in a half a year and cancel every promise they made the first one was my favorite online game but this is just bad and i hate to see the game go in such a bad place because of blizzard
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-10,"overwatch used to be a cool game by cool developers and all, now its just the remains of that cool era with horrible battle pass system that has no point playing for it, feels stale and its overpopulated with jerks that give you a really hard time ingame. for the sake of your health and nerves, there are better shooters out there to enjoy"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-09,activision doesnt like black people and this game reflects that by charging you for pve they promised 6 years ago.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-09,"a realy sad ending of an copy paste from overwatch 1, without any effort or love for the game itself my most positive view on overwatch 2 is i like the 5 player gamemode more than the old one everything else has gone worse"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-08,"this game is incredible, addictive, i play it since day one and the 5v5 formula is so much better than 6v6, suppression of lootboxes is perfect, i prefer way more a battlepass style, if i want to retribute the studio by buying items, i want to know what i pay for. and the season 6 tomorrow with pve, new hero, new modes, new maps, omg this will be absolutely insane, i can't wait !"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-08,"1700 hours of game time over the past 10 years of overwatch being out. it is a shell of what it once was. when it started it was a fantastic quality shooter with crisp and satisfying gunplay, people playing it were optimistic, regular content updates and even though it introduced a controversial at the time loot box system, they provided a substantial amount of in game opportunities to receive loot boxes and get skins. in my level of play, i was able to get every skin in the game for free, but i contributed money anyway to support the developers and the pr team. time went on, some devs left, jeff left, promises, were broken, blizzard was bought by scumdivision. overwatch 1 turned into an empty shell devioid of players, optimism, and updates for the autumn and winter of its life. the remaining players were depressed, mean spirited, angry, bigoted, and more. it was demoralizing. overwatch 2 gave old players and new players a ray of hope for improvement. but more controversy. blizz's silent support of the ccp. blizz lied about pve, the main reason ow2 became a thing. predatory monetization with the facade of f2p. the most disgustingly disappointing and predatory battle pass system i've ever seen. expensive shop skins. no way to get skins for free in any meaningful way anymore. bigotry and hatred abound in this f2p hellscape. as an lgbt person i'm disgusted by the lack of enforcement of their so called progressive views that they always espouse in their announcements page. there seems to be a skeleton crew of staff. no way to contact blizz for complaints. a terrible metascore and overall perception of what remains. microsoft has little hope of salvaging this game after what activision has done to it. best of luck to them. i highly recommend staying away from this game like it is the plague."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-07,they add crappy battlepasses and game types of which they don't let you chose which game mode you want to play. don't nerf problematic characters. but will nerf an already not spectacular character making them unplayably bad. an all around not great game from a dev that has fallen incredibly far from their former glory. taking away one more point for adding pay to play characters. another point gone for the devs complete lack of feedback and replies.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-06,"fk you bobby kotick, give us pve and doomfist back. ow2 is literally a trash."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-04,"edit i quit after season 5. they want you to pay for pve content that they canceled and then added what had been created up to that point in episodes that are limited time only unless bought. we lost archives for this, which was one of the best events in the game. there is no denying how much blizzard does not care about their player base now. 6 years and this is the worst state the game has ever been in. how the mighty has fallen. i would give it a 10 now if i could. original i was one of the few that could play at launch and honestly as a long time gamer of overwatchapex legendsfortnight blizzard completely dropped the ball on this. there is no real reward for playing anymore, the battle pass is worse then halos attempt, the ui leaves much to be desired, and while i understand the loot box argument, i think getting rid of it completely was one of the stupidest things they did. while moving to 5v5 was the right thing to do since i hated the double shield meta, the decrease in kill time has turned it in to a dps rush, good one v ones has turned in to whoever gets the first hit usually wins and as a healer you will feel useless trying to keep anything up thats targeted by 2 people or more. also, due to kill time now sombratracers are unaposed going after healersbackend, you will just auto die and most healers do not have the dps to defend themselves anymore. due to all the changes games have become very lopsided, you either run over the opposing team or get run over. team kills, which used to be rare in ow1, are now common and demoralizing. as for new maps, they are ambitious and too big for this pace of gameplay, you will not see 12 of them since your all but required to stay as a pack now to win any fights. finally the monetization is as bad as ea star wars battlefield 2. its like blizzard got a list of everything that pissed off gamers over the past 5 years and put it in this game. officially petitioning for ow1 back, double shield meta and all. they had so much to look at when making this game and ignored it all."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-02,"i loved overwatch, but i can't recommend it to this day since they changed name to overwatch 2. they have prostituted the game with aggressive and abusive monetization. toxicity is rewarded by allowing people who spend an entire game harassing another person to get their account banned. everything is done for a limited time, so if you start late you will miss a lot and feel treated like a second class player. most games are made unpleasant by the players you have to play with or the little sense of control you get. i can't forget about the horrible physics where you stay floating when you are on an object."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-08-01,they killed ow because the loot boxes weren't making enough money and replaced it with this joke of a live service. full of aggressive monetization and season passes! the selling point of replayable pve is dead. 5v5 just lead to raid boss tank balance. at least the removal of most the cc is nice for gameplay... if i wanted to play this trash. i miss the game i spent 40 and years of my life playing. i have a deep disdain for this sequel
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-29,"jogo s decaiu a cada atualizao, modo competitivo totalmente injusto e no recompensador, passes e skins com preos abusivos."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-29,"played ov1 a lot when it first came out. went to blizzcon 2016 and saw the big reveal and fell in love with what was available and what was promised later on. well... we never got the later on promises, so i quit playing the one trick pony . years later, ov2 came round with insulting free to play gimmicks galore and still no campaign. sure, it's coming next month but looking at what blizzard either canceled or postponed versus what they focused on and released on time tells us all we need to know about how blizzard intends to use ov2 players to make money on nothing. all of the money grubbing microtransactions were completed and polished, but the game content everyone wanted was not. boring after a small amount of time. overwatch 2 is not a good game, it is a blizzard atm for . ps the majority of highly rated reviews being professional paid critics is highly suspect...."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-28,"i played it a lot now and it is so much worse than its predecessor. matchmaking balance is ruined, no more real incentives to play as free2play player, community got more toxic, battlepasses with an additional shop, predatory practices to incentivise more and more players to pay, broken promises pve being the biggest of them all, etc the list could go on forever. and time and time again they are telling us they'll communicate more in the future which in the end never happens. this game is not worth my time and i regret every minute i spent in this game by now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-27,"tf2 rip off done worse, sweaty ass people, community is bland, boring and non existant at times, the characters are bland and boring too i mean cmon mercy is ligit an angel who only wants to heal and help people and has never done anything wrong ever... wow... creative the game has no personality, no theme other than it being a very non offensive fps, the game balance is  and the stun mechanics are super annoying and boring to play against, ultimates can't be countered and are unfun to play against all you do is press 1 or 2 buttons to kill at least one person which is still more than enough to be a bad trade off as the negative emotion of the guy who died purely because the enemy had their meter filled up and pressed a button isn't fun to play against it feels like gunplay is quite minimal and the game focuses too heavily on abilities as some character don't even require aim... at all, just press a button in a 70 degree circle and the enemy is beginning to die, the game feels like an ability waiting sum and characters have next to no mechanical depth, annoying '1 2' combos to instakill enemies, things like roadhog shotgun hit pretty much being able to kill every hero and even if they don't die they still are left with next to no health which pretty much implies death and those combos take low amount of skill to pull off, overall the game has low skill floors to characters yet the mechanics are confusing and the abilities are overwhelming to learn and a low skill ceiling meaning you probably get bored of each character soon enough and plus there's only so few characters in the meta. also don't get me started on the micro transactions, i won't get too much into it but it costs a whole lot and you get very little and yes there is also a battle pass very bad imo. tf2 has more depth mechanical skill and gamesense and while yes, competitively, tf2 is kind of  it makes for a waaaaaaay better experience in general with easy to understand mechanics, relatively low skill floors and sky rocketing skill ceilings, each character has countless of little quirks that when learnt and executed correctly in the right situations can turn a whole fight around and be rewarding and fun to play as and against, it also encourages actual mechanical skill aiming to be involved and you can only play one character and not get bored for weeks at a time. play tf2, abandon overwatch 2"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-27,the best game ever. and it got sequel. great sequel. finally quick queues and not destroy shields matches. i like it
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-26,i don't see any improvements over original game. all the changes were done for the sake of making some changes to call it a new game so they can go crazy with monetisation.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-24,"wdym the overwatch 2 will be available on steam? did your game doesnt bring that much money so you will be selling battlepass every 2 months on steam? i pay for o1 to have a nice time with my friends without a minitransaction, where i forced to buy bp, because i want to play on a new hero which always super unbalanced on the first time of the update i think not only me want to go back in time, where blizzard didnt promise a great pve mode and on blizzcon they would talk about an enormous patch with 3 new heroes and change amount of tanks from 2 to 1 sorry, but this is an absolute failure of overwatch"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-24,"this game is disgusting. better keep the first up than lunching this  the pve was the only reason for the second, and they canceled it by lack of funds but put 1.5m in a lgbtqia event no one carred. i'm not against lgbt events but when it cost the game to die that's a problem. hope one day all those people will get fired and try new things for restarting the licence."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-23,"i wish you could get overwatch coins by the battle pass so you wouldn't have to spend 10 every 2 months but they prefer make choices that gets them money instead of making their fans happy, that's why i play fortnite."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-23,"i liked the part where activision blizzard spent 3 years changing the team size from 6 to 5. absolutely incredible. i can't believe how scummy it was to shut down overwatch 1 when releasing overwatch 2. probably because it's such a steaming hunk of junk that the only way people were going to play it is if they're forced to. that combined with the microtransactions and the discontinuing of pve has left me convinced that this is probably the worst game to ever be made, and the fact it was made by such a large company in the gaming industry quite as blizzard baffles me even more. this game deserves to be trashed on. literally the only reason i even log into this game anymore is for the custom games, and its actually very funny that the most enjoyable parts of the game for me weren't even made by the developers themselves, which is probably why the latest event was just completely ripped off of workshop.codes. how far you've fallen, blizzard."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-22,overwatch 1 was one of my most genuine favorite games. i watched owl and i played comp religiously. i cared about this game. but with the release of ow2 the ruined team play. the ruined comp by keeping in the forced role queue. they destroyed comp for people who care about the game and changed the events from a play to get boxes of loot for outfits to new event give us 30 dollars. each battle pass is a waste of potential. every single skin that was once completely free to obtain through loot boxes are now behind 1020 dollar pay walls. what a disgusting fall from grace. now with owl being eliminated as well i feel so bad for the team of developers that were there since ow1 and slowly watched it die as the man in charge slowly burned their game away. i bless them and curse the higher ups. what a waste.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-22,"i am here for the faith boycottblizzard!!! we are no shareholders or dont invest on the stockexchange,we stupid ppl only bought the game ...again"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-21,the most awfull downgrade from one of the best games in the gaming history. activision your are a piece of  shame on you
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-21,money grab battle pass bs. i'm out. blizzard has driven me away from 2 games now cause i'm not going to buy into their battle pass bs.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-21,"the fact that they  up this hard is hilarious. paycheck stealing thieves deserve everything coming to them. hope their stocks tank since they only care about being greedy mutts,"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-19,"by overwriting overwatch 1, a game that was worth every penny, with this f2p buy our newest cosmetics fest , they've lost all of what was great about the game. it's sad to see, as i poured hours of time into overwatch, only to have it all sapped away with advertisements for new skins. i'm done with this company. they won't be getting any more of my money."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-19,"blizzard is ruining their games. i lost all hope in this company. way to turn something beautiful and fun, into a cesspool of crappy updates and bugs. disappointing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-19,"ridiculous monetization aside, the updateupgrade replaces the first game so we can't play it anymore, and not everything carried over, so we lose some things we earned. i loved ow1 and played it a few times a week for years, and if you hadn't forced an upgrade on me i could just go back to playing ow1 and ignore the allaround inferior sequel, but now i just don't play ow."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-16,"quite despisable game, which offers no fun, or creativity, just frustration and demands for money through its horrible monetization system, ow future is purged with the cancellation of pve, lets see how long this will hold out"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-15,"many features taken away. still lacks training for new players. matchmaking is abysmal. it's not overwatch 2, it's a step backwards, as dunkey says. overwatch 0.5 . pve cancelled. it's as if pve was never true and a lie to facilitate ow into this f2p monstrosity."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-15,"plus grosse blague du jeuxvido. un repatch avec des promesses non tenus, une politique conomique dsastreuse pour les amoureux de cette franchise, sans compter les problmes en interne qu'il y a chez blizzard. bref, nime preuve que blizzard ne fait plus du jv mais de l'arnaque assum en profitant de ses franchises fonctionnelle pour faire cracher de l'argent."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-13,"i have been playing overwatch since the first game came out, and i was excited to try the sequel. however, i was quickly let down by the terrible matchmaking system that ruins the game experience. the matchmaking is so unbalanced that you either get stomped by a team of much higher skill level, or you get matched with teammates who have no clue what they are doing. it's frustrating and unfair, and it makes the game feel like a chore rather than a fun activity. blizzard seems to not care about fixing this issue, as they never communicate with the players or address their feedback. every new season, the matchmaking gets worse and worse, and blizzard says nothing. they are too busy making cosmetic items and new heroes that nobody asked for, instead of focusing on the core gameplay and balance. they have lost touch with their fanbase, and they have ruined a potentially great game. overwatch 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to deliver on its promises. it has some good features, such as the pve mode and the improved graphics, but they are overshadowed by the awful matchmaking that makes the game unplayable. i do not recommend this game to anyone who values their time and money. save yourself the frustration and avoid this game at all costs. if that wasn't enough, the skins are absurdly expensive and repetitive, the battle pass is short and with very few interesting things and the game is clogged with toxic people, who are sowing bullying, hate speech and suicideselfharm and if you report it to blizzard, they do not ban the player, much less respond to the complaint. run away from this game that only wants your money but has nothing to offer but anger!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-13,"absolute  terrible balancing and map design. the only thing that is enjoyable in this game is the custom games. don't forget the fact it will censor out  but not censor out tie a noose. it was only released cause blizzard needed money and didn't want to finish the pve gamemode. oh did i forget to mention how they advertised mccree's new name, cassidy like it was a celebration when they only did it cause the irl person it was named after committed sexual assault?"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-07,overwatch 2 game for those players who have better macros or other types of cheats and ordinary players have very little better anticheat fixed than adding a penalty section when you exit the game
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-07,"its 0 of 10. not because of gameplay, promises or whatever. you are selling game before its releas. you take money! and after  you pull out so mush broken piece of st that someone who bought it can not even close it! job well done! once more drowning into a pool of brown smoothy. thx for trying to break our computers! appriciated."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-05,"let me make this clear, this is not a sequel!! this is a pathetic money grab made by a bunch of talentless dogs who replaced the real game devs. i wouldn't be surprised if the devs were too busy sexually harassing women to focus on actually developing a sequel to ow. these fools just adjust ow1 and rerelease it as ow2 while killing off ow1 in case ow2 was too inferior, giving players no choice to go back to ow1. i honestly hope some hackers or modders can bring back ow1, at least modders have more talent than aaa game devs these days. on top of all that, there is also the serious issue about the cancelled pve."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-07-04,complete disappointment. worse than the original game in every way. the pve looks terrible scrapping the only interesting parts of it. i barely cared about the archive missions when the were free but now we have to pay for them. classic activisionblizzard greed.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-25,overwatch 2 promised a lot of features for the evolving hero shooter. i am sad to say though that blizzard has missed hugely with ow2. and its sad as the game has excellent potential to be something great. pros  heroes still feel fun to play  you need team work to succeed in the game! cons  a lot of the promised features are being cut out like the pve mode.  the upcoming story missions are paid.  some balancing issues.  maps are pretty bad in my opinion.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-23,"one of the best games ever has been systematically killed by greed for the past 8 years, no pve was the final nail in the coffin. this game is dead, the franchise is dead, and blizzard is dead to me. activision blizzard is officially boycotted until bobby kotick steps down from the company and they prove that they can still make a playable title again. i should've seen the writing on the wall with reforged but still maintained hope. lesson learned, never hope, play retro instead. every critic that gave this game above a 50, oh wait, that's literally all of them, should never be allowed to review so much as a candy bar again. a slug could do your job better. you would be ashamed of yourselves if you had the neurons required to experience human emotion. also the fact that metacritic still has the trailer up that was a complete lie used to  people into buying the battle pass in anticipation for the pve, is disgraceful."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-23,"ruined the game by gatekeeping everything behind paywall, not delivering content, i created an account to put this score. you ruined one of the most promising multiplayer game ever, what a time to be alive."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-20,"first game was good, r.i.p. second  somewhat playable, but only like any generic mobile hero shooter with awful monetization.... and there are many better games in this category already... they managed to ruin like 90 of good things that existed in the first game..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-19,so much imbalance in the game. made macri even more imbalanced. many heroes carry you without much difficulty. the fact that pve made paid adds disrespect to the piggy bank.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-17,"below is my original revew, this is update as of june 17th 2023 the game is actually worse than i initially described it  infested with hackers  you will find one in every game!  free to play and also first person shooter game that has no anticheat implemented!!!  updates bring no new content except cosmeticsbelow on them  either the team that works on the game consists of 5 people or none of the people actually is working on anything substantial  the cosmetics are ugly, trash and useless  simply put none of the cosmetics they introduce are worth anything, yet they ask you to pay real life money for them lmao!  they promised us content and they lied  they promised to give us single player content and they now said they won't bring it anymore. they lied. and you want to trust and support company that lies blatantly like this? whoever bought diablo 4  you are the problem!!! whoever buys wow  you are the problem!!! do not support blizzard in any way imaginable!!! let the company rot and die!!!  i had to create an account here finally just to inform everyone on the state of this game called overwatch 2. overwatch 2 is a multiplayer online pvp hero shooter game with no anticheat system, toxic community and no support. features  there is no anticheat in a game that is already infested with cheaters.  there are a lot of smurfs. people who are getting destroyed on their relatively high rank main account so they make a new one and ruin the game for the new players and the casual players.  you will get banned for calling out cheaters and smurfs.  there are places where the game is flashy or too colorful which is dangerous to some people.  the community in the game is incredibly toxic and they are asslicking the corrupted company that made the game.  when you have any issues, the support will not help you.  it's essentially the first game, it's even using the same files from the first game.  the servers are terrible and you will experience disconnects, queues, connection issues.  unbalanced gameplay. some heroes are clearly better than others.  it's all about the grind. if you want to obtain something in the game you have to play a lot to get it.  if you want to obtain something quick, you have to pay money for it.  the interface of the game has been made apparently in paint 3d. they couldn't even put antialiasing on the letters. it looks ugly and not made by professionals. the hud is so minimal and simplistic, feels like a game in alpha stage of development made by amateurs.  made for esports and nobody cares about esports.  the promised singleplayer campaign that will come with the game is not in the game.  the promised new features and cosmetics, better visuals etc. are not in the game.  the company is milking what's left of the community.  the company never listens to the community. all they are inserting into game through updates are cosmetic items, nothing else.  you cannot play the game unless you give them your phone number for the purpose of sms verification. apparently tons of phone service providers have blacklisted blizzard sms verification as spam. in turn blizzard has blacklisted those providers. so you are out of luck if you are using phone provider who has been blacklisted.  the company is deleting forum posts that put it in negative light.  you will get banned if you speak about all this ingame or on the forums.  will you believe a company who does all of the above? have they lied about being ddosed? are they not spending any money on servers and just doing the bare minimum to keep the game running? have they lied about banwaves? are cheaters getting banned or are they letting everyone play because there is barely anyone playing? are they mistreating their employees to keep the pigs in high positions richer and more privileged? let's look at the positives about the game  it's optimized well, it can run on a toaster at this point. but it has to so it can reach as many people as possible.  i like mercy. blizzard has once again showed us how corrupted and corporate they have become. there is no care for the customer or the employees who work hard every day. it's all about making all the money to feed the pigs at the top of the company. nobody should be supporting this company or giving them any money."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-16,"i bought ow1 2 years after it's release. now what do we got ? not the overwatch 2 that was promised, they said that the pve was going to be the big thing, then it was cancelled. basically, overwatch 2 is the same as overwatch 1, but without lootboxes, and a change in hud. also, a thing that made me hate the game even more, is the battle pass, and the lack of content there is. the event are the recycled one from the first game. welcome to overwatch 0.5."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-15,"matchmaking is just not fun in this game anymore. you either get matched up against people way better than you and get rolled for a day, or you get matched up with a team rolls the other team. there's no good games where you feel like you can come back  you can usually tell if you're going to lose within the first few minutes. it's just not fun anymore, and blizzard seems more focused on creating skins than they do actually making a fun game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-15,to be honest the only reason i got this game was for the cool story mode thingy that they said they would make and when i heard it was cancelled i just deleted the game because i saw no point in playing it.because it is just the same thing over and over again like there is nothing to the game beside the copied characters they made from taking ideas from different  if you want my advice don't download the game because the game is just very horrible for reasons i can't explain. rather agree or disagree i'm just saying this for a opinion. my opinion.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-15,"cant see any reason other than trying to revive the dead first one for releasing another game and putting a 2 beside the name. also why make the first unavailable. one of the best online games of all time in terms of fun and game design, but the developer couldnt keep it alive because they were too occupied with trying to please communities that dont even play and  out cash with loot boxes. not saying those communities shouldnt have a place on the stories and characters but dont make that the priority. also like the first one i played a lot and had so much fun but the matchmaking is really bad, and toxic community pushes you off the game but blizzard doesnt do anything about them. wish online pc gaming community was a healthier place."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-14,"casual team based multiplayer pvp shooter with coop events. the pvp part is solid most of the time but gets interrupted by balancing issues, technical problems and bugs even the game is basically the same as overwatch 1. the pve part is partially implemented as events and later on as a paid premium service. sadly it got cut down the bare bones without the promised skill tree and leveling system. for a few rounds with friends ok, better pick some other free 2 player shooter. any other, no matter which."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-14,"it's so unfortunate, that indiedeveloper studio blizzard couldn't keep up and create the content, that was fking main seller of the franchise, and afterwards it became obvious, that somehow they're still running out of money, so the small group of people, who are responsible for the whole project, that they need to tighten your belts and make the previous free content be blocked by a paywall. so sad sad sad"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-10,"people really seem to hate this one due to the devs, but all in all it's not a bad game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-08,"1. it is not a new game. it is a large update that is being advertised as a sequel. it's painful hearing professional critics say comments like it really feels like the original overwatch... that's because it is the original overwatch. league of legends had a bigger overhaul in the past and they didn't tout their game as league of legends 2 when doing so. let's even compare this to an actual sequel from activisionblizzard, call of duty, using mw vs. mw2 by infinity ward. there are all new operators, maps, guns, significant changes to gunplay, movement, loadout systems, among additions like swimming and water combat. on top of all that, they have a completely new mode dmz, campaign, wz2.0, and more. this is just a quick overview to give a comparison to what you are getting in overwatch 2, leading to my next point 2. it is difficult to fathom how this is several years of work. even for a patch, after this long, this is a small number of additional maps. there is only a single new mode push which is okay, it's a slight twist on what we have as regular gameplay, but it's hardly innovative and does not add much variety. removal of at least one map, maybe 6 new maps, a few of which are unique to the new push mode. if you've played overwatch for years, it's not exactly fun to come back for overwatch 2 to play the same exact map you've played except they moved the directional light a few degrees so it's sunset instead. i'm not playing the new call of duty finding myself playing the same map as the last. it has been confirmed by blizzard, in the most lawyerspeech sort of way as usual, that the supposedly upcoming pve mode will not be released as a 60 box, but rather they have shifted their model now to start releasing things seasonally. this is clearly so that people will end up paying even more than 60 to obtain all the content that was originally planned to be a single 60 purchase. any thought that they are providing you the customer any more by changing to this monetization model is gaslighting, which i will elaborate more on. 3. there are 3 new heroes, again, a sad number to add as with the maps. to go deeper into this, there is far too much concern by the development team to have balanced heroes all the time and provide expensive promotional material for each and every character they introduce. perfect balance is unachieveable, and it would be better for the fun of the game to add way more, especially for a sequel. they should have dropped another 21 heroes the number of heroes in the original overwatch and embraced the chaos as there was when ow originally released. there has been a distinct lack of variety and creativity even among the 3 we have gotten. considering the last few additions to the roster, i suspect this will be ongoing. two have repeated origins, we have yet another japanese character who can run up walls and has magical abilities based off a spirit animal, questionably stereotypical of japanese people in the way that afrohaitians would have voodoo magic. we have another austrailian character from junkertown. i still await the actually creative variety of characters we were teased with for overwatch 1 when it was announced at blizzcon 2014, with more shown to us at blizzcon 2017. if you have not seen them, i suggest you take a look so you can understand just how lackluster the character's we've actually received have been. watch our 4th new hero be yet another a variation of a hero we had... 4. in addition to the change in business model for overwatch 2's pve mode, the f2p monetization model ow2 has changed to is also predatory, as you would expect from blizzard especially following diablo immortal this year. prices for skins are absurdly high, many are minor changes from their base a different jacket on kiriko for example. other games with a similar business model are far more rewarding for playing without buying anything, fortnite being a great example, where you can generally purchase the premium battle pass just by earning vbucks via the free battle pass, in which you will earn more vbucks where you can buy the next season's premium battle pass, and earn more vbucks, of which you can of course buy whatever you want from the store. existing rewards from ow1 were not updated to match the quality of the new ow2 skins the faces for example have not changed. they have been deceptive by saying they were updated in any fashion, it was only the materials which are globally updated with the engine. the amount of time it takes to earn anything is hysterically long, literally months to earn one thing. paying 60 will not equate to the value of purchasing ow1 for 60. i never usually review games. the pve mode will have to be incredible to make up for this dumpsterfire. edit 682023  coming back to this, i am solidifying that this game is a 010 with the news about ow2 pve having been canceled."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-07,"do not play. incredibly blatant cash grab . company deleted the 1st game just to make sure you couldn't play anything better. they replaced it with a lie about a story mode, insane shop prices for skins that used to be free, bare atoms of crumbs of free content dripped down every season, taking away a player spot from each team, a garbage new game mode, removal of maps, bugs everywhere, removing characters from the game for large periods of time in a counter role based team shooter, and lack of any ways to make or feel like you made progress in any area of the game. this game wants your money and not the 60 dollars you payed for the better 1st game that it shot dead. the company is untrustworthy, does not care about you or your time, and wants to wring you dry of every single penny. please for the love of games as a medium and for the respect for your time, do not play this game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-06,"it's terrible, i've been playing since 2016! a company of liars! cancel pvp !"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-06,"the only thing that's good about this game are the characters and art style. everything else is bs. lets begin with the overpriced skins. not to mention they are old skins 7 year old skins. the matchmaking is absolute garbage. for example in quickplay, you will get transferred to a lobby where your like seconds away from losing and their is absolutely no way in recuperating. very toxic lobbies. and competitive play where most of your matches are rigged. its either you roll the other team or the other team rolls you. competitive doesn't require skill, it requires luck. also, if someone leaves good luck on winning. once someone leaves 9 out of 10 times your getting to get rolled on. unless you are a big time streamer and have friends to play with in your lobby, then don't even bother playing comp. also, they took away pve to promote their pvp which is garbage anyway."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-05,"what is this overwatch 1 mini update? where were the updates for the 1st overwatch all this time? nothing new. the same overwatch 1, only with a few bug fixes that killed the game. result give me back my good old overwatch 1."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-05,"all of the negative comments and zerorated reviews are completely valid if you played overwatch 1. firstly, the matchmaker is a disaster. in many matches the skill variance it accepts in order to speed up the queues is so wide that you could have middle to low ranked players in the same match as grandmasters, and this leads to fast and unfair onesided stompfests. add to this the players who give up early when they see they will get stomped, by leaving, throwing, afking and easily 50 of matches are not competitive or fair in some way, even if you are winning. of the remaining 50, expect frustrating gameplay because now there is only one tank, so all sort of counterplay and interesting things are removed once your lone tank dies. some heroes are overtuned because there is just one tank to defend, such as how snipers are gods now and debuffers too strong against just 1 tank. add to this the smurfs who are taking advantage of all this and destroying lower ranks and it's just so hard to find a fair, balanced, compelling match where you truly said wow what a gg!. match quality is just so bad that you can go 10 matches before truly saying that was a fun gameplay experience. secondly, the monetization is just so offensive. in ow1, after buying the game, you could earn your skins and voice lines and other stuff randomly by playing and by participating in events. and smurfs had to rebuy the game in order to get a fresh start. in ow2, you have to pay for the battle pass each season if you want to earn skins and cosmetics at a reasonable rate some stuff is locked completely behind the battle passes. but now that the game is freetoplay, it's completely free for smurfs to create unlimited multiple accounts over and over again to keep stomping lower ranked players to oblivion. it's completely backwards. let's not even begin about the deep issues with ingame shop where you pay for old or revamped skins, or very overpriced new ones. thirdly, the entire reason for creating overwatch 2 and sunsetting overwatch 1 was to introduce a whole pve structure, but that recently has been canceled entirely. the game will likely only have the occasional pve mission in arcade which we used to have. they're fun but that hardly qualifies as the huge pve game we were promised. and one mode they released recently called starwatch was just as awful respawn simulator for the team on offense, literally. while this issue is invisible to new players, it just shows how blizzard pulled the rug from under existing players to focus on the more lucrative monetization it was said that was part of the decision  that pve won't make money like the shop for pvp does. if you're new, it's likely you'll be steamrolled repeatedly by smurfs in most of your matches. by the time you get to middle ranks, there will be lots of leavers and throwers who give up at the first sign of trouble. at high ranks you need to be in a group or you'll get crushed by organized hit squads of hardcore players queueing together. in quick play and arcade modes where ranks are much broader in matchmaking, your match outcome is pretty much decided at setup by the matchmaker based on who has the new players vs who has the experienced players. i'm giving this game a 2 just to be fair, as it is a smooth running game with great graphics, good maps and cool heroes, and because someone who is new to the game might have some fun for a while. however, it is a huge step down from overwatch 1 in terms of features, match quality and overall fun factor. and every season each is about 7 weeks the bad parts about it somehow just keep getting much worse. match quality is so bad right now and queue times are going up for middle ranks, especially in the arcade, as many players are leaving. if you're new, give it a try  it's free. but i am confident you'll grow out of it after a couple of weeks and pick one of the many other games that are hot right now. if you're returning from ow1, you will be greatly disappointed in ow2."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-05,"i have paid 20 for this game about 46 months before ow2 released and that is one of my biggest regret. not only that it's now free to play, i don't think overwatch 0.2 sorry i mean overwatch 2 give me anything even worth 5 and this game just become a cash grab game that event to unlock new hero you have to pay or complete the battle pass. then they just delete the loot box system and make me to buy the skin even though i have already paid for the game. and now they even decided to stop the pve the one thing that makes this game worth waiting. so, this game basically become another online pvp competitive cash grab game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-04,the representation is only for the minorities. the match making is broken. streamers get softball throws with their matchmaking. pve was destroyed. anything is better than this pile.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-04,"i wrote a whole long review for overwatch 1 but i'll keep it quick here, this game is now a soulless husk only out to get your money, the matchmaking is nonexistent saying they are going to fix it every season but never do and all their promises mainly a story mode that people were waiting for were empty and never came to fruition."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-04,a worse version of ow 1 its a less complete game with missing features and now the pve the main the thing about ow 2 is canceled
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-03,"a failure that will be studied for years to come, stripped the game of almost everything that made it unique and addicting. replaced it with disgusting monetization tactics, and out of touch balancing. lied outright about what the game was supposed to be, and then gaslighted when pressed on it. i will never touch another blizzard game as long as i live."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-03,"on it's own, overwatch 2 is a fine game. but remembering overwatch 1 and all the promises they made for overwatch 2, it's just unacceptable how hard they dropped the ball. blizzard is a huge company, not an indie dev, them saying they can't deliver their original vision is complete hogwash. if blizzard were a person, they would be a guy who's cheating on his girlfriend pve because there's a new girl in town the battlepass with tons of money in her pockets from her sugar daddy. the players."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-01,"pathetic excuse for a sequel. it is an objectively worse version of overwatch 1. what is new?  five new heroes. had ow1 development not been halted, there would be nine by now.  heroes now have to be unlocked... in a game where hero choice is like rockpaperscissors. hope you like grinding for dozens of hours just to not be at a disadvantage or you could just pay money.  a premium currency, unobtainable in useable quantities by playing the game. but you can just pay money to get some.  higher prices. not only do legacy items cost more than they used to, some are now premium items! meaning they can only be unlocked if you pay money  removal of unpaid rewards for playing... y'know, because what's the point of unlocking stuff if you don't have to pay money  a battle pass! this is the only good new feature... is what i would say if this wasn't the single worst battle pass in the entire gaming industry. zero credit returns for completing the pass only game i know of that doesn't, new heroes are locked behind the premium tiers, and only 80 tiers fewest tiers of any game i know of. you will have to pay money every season to remain competitive.  removal of skill based matchmaking in quickplay. don't want to try hard in competitive mode? just get stomped by players three times your skill level in casual mode!  removal of looking for group page. because imagine the horror of being able to find competent, good, or fun teammates. nope, a new set of random toxic strangers every match is the only way this game is meant to be played.  the pve mode, the very reason this sequel exists! if you were thrilled for a fully fledged campaign mode like the limited archives events in ow1, boy do i have news for you! it's canceled... at least you can still play the legacy archives content once a year! no wait, the legacy content has been canceled too... thanks blizzard! alright, enough of the sarcasm. overall, this game is still fun to play at least not competitively. the core gameplay is hardly changed from ow1, with the main difference being 5v5 instead of 6v6 teams. i won't argue that this change is better or worse, it's just slightly different. so why is this game 010 in my opinion? because doing literally nothing would've been better than releasing this sequel, as overwatch 1 is no longer available following this game's release. it is a cash grab, and an insult to all of the players that supported this game and blizzard through the last 7 years. this was the game that got me into pc gaming, and that game no longer exists. only a shell of its former self."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-06-01,"this is not a sequel, this was them reworking the in game shop to sell a battle pass and 20 skins. now they announced they weren't going to be doing any pve except for the limited time events that they already do. this game should be considered an update and deserves all the negative reviews it gets."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-30,"this generation's greatest baitandswitch, overwatch 2 has recently been revealed to be all it ever truly was a corporate grift to replace a hugely successful game with a cash shop. the game's developers continue to defend its existence primarily on the promise of future content as such, the history of such promises is essential to weighing the value of its present and future. revealed in 2019 as a massive singleplayer campaign with story and character progression, ow2's development resulted in a massive content desert for ow1 full years without maps, new heroes, or events, as even new skins dried up to a handful of literal recolors for the 2022 events. a full year before ow2's release, the team was fully aware that they would not be delivering the project they had promised however, the game continued to be described, marketed, and sold, under a lie of omission, with the truth finally squeaking out seven months postlaunch, some thirty minutes into a completely unrelated developer podcast. in the absence of that vision, overwatch 2 is in every way inferior to its predecessor more maps removed than added a new 5v5 matchup that continues to be severely dysregulated, with entire heroes built around roles they can no longer perform a new mode held by the player base as the worst available to the point of crushing the soul of comp play a laundry list of changes that players find worse than what they replaced and of course, the surgical removal of freeplay unlocking of content, so precise that only now, months later, could a f2p player afford their first legendary skin for a single character. the most functional facet of the game at launch was the cash shop, and by functional i mean would purchase things you didn't intend to purchase, no refunds. what was once a transaction model that would allow even a casual player to unlock everything i was one such player now places nearly everything behind minimum 20 purchases. much of the content being released includes tokens most players never use, and has been churned out so fast that recolors have been sold as legendaries when recolor with small modifications was the definition of epic, and a recent battle pass included a junker queen highlight intro that would make a secondyear animation student blush in secondhand embarrassment. the content of ow1 stopped for the story mode of ow2, but that mode isn't coming. the content drops of ow2 barely match the content of ow1 during its brightest days, and even that means a new mode sometimes that you'll play for 10 minutes. the roadmap brought forth as apologia for the announcement does its best to sound grand and vague, but look where promises have brought anyone who supported this game emptyhanded. there is zero precedent, between ow1, ow2's promotion, and the first four seasons of the battle pass, to believe that anything will improve materially from the present state. dedicated players lost years of content updates and actively contributed to padding actiblizz's player base and pocketbooks, in service of a lie the company knew was a lie a year before release, yet still maintained. to take part in this rugpull is to encourage the company responsible to maintain lies and deception to reject the game wholesale is to actively tell those responsible that deceptive business practices have consequences. to that end, i cannot grant a single point in favor of this project. it is an inferior version of what came before, but more importantly, it is a question from activision blizzard are you willing to put up with this? no. i'm not."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-30,"this is just an update to get blizzard more money and literally just made the game worse. give us the pve mode you promised, and give us back ow1."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-30,"blizzard is dead, and more so overwatch 2.  terrible matchmaking  terrible balancing  5 stack??  terrible ranking system that doesn't even work properly  skins that are way to expensive  matchmaking   barley any content  oh and that big fk'n promise they lied about, you know pve!! like seriously how can you have a 2 in this game when it has less that the first game. what a con.."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,"oh yeah , i loved the pve , player versus enterprise , i hope that blizzard die soon"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,"went from ov 1 to ov 2 with a promise of an actual game with it, back to a ripped ov 1, please, like cmon. holiday activities, as if, we have always had that and everything couldve been earned for free, now its darn near impossible and is 20 dollars for a recolored basic skin. had a bunch of maps taken away from ov 1, along with game modes and a whole slew of things that were in ov1. now ov is a shop, thats it. there used to be events with releases of skins, now events are just recolored lazy skins that are way too overpriced. i cannot trust this company anymore, i had enough. i didnt love the ov1 ranking system but somehow it is better than the ov2 ranking system, and role queue is doodoo too. not worth getting into this game, get into another game with a better company behind it and likes their community. waste of time game. doesnt matter how good the developers are, if the company behind it is corrupt, the game will suffer."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,"blizzard just killed overwatch 1 with promises of bringing this new pve mode, and now this trash company have just canceled it. but now we have trash monetization like in free service games on mobile phones, they don't care that i bought this game for full price in 2016. i played this mess only because wanted to play pve, waited since 2019 for it. and now they're say something like we're poor indie company that can't make the archieves with upgrades. a really big billionare company can't make something like players made in workshop in far 2018, hahaha! zombie escape missions by mazatack, heat street and more examples. and i don't talk about deleted mechanics like on fire, that they returning, lol. they made some changes because of making a sequel. they understand that they're doing idiotic things to their game, but they don't even apologize for spitting in my soul and souls of other now former fans. my heart is broken... again. i wish blizzard a really painful bankruptcy for their fraud and other crimes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,"you know, was a super fun game. now it is the most horrific, appalling, waste of my headspace that currently floats around in my mind, and there are so, so many contenders for that role. same old story of profits ruining every 'couldhavebeen' thing out there. i made this account to post this review and i say this if you support this game at all still, we have morally opposing views. i, in my heart, truly believe the sequence of events that unfolded to expunge from the first game this virulent wasteheap that is what we currently call a sequel is equivalent to moral failing, not simple lacks of judgement, but premeditated, followed through malcontent for blizzard's fellow human. that is how it always is with companies though. hope karma gets the best of you, cowards, nepenthes"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,blizzard is once again price gouging. they lied to their fan base by choosing not to release core features of the game that they had promised.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,"blizzass. what a joke of company. thought thing would get better since i play the og ow on 2017. nope. my hope for this company is gone to dust. nonsense sequel. what was a fun, engaging game, now even opening it feels like a chore. uninstalled it. plus, i will never forgive for the broken promise of pve, the thing blizzass promise when they pull our beloved the og overwatch. lord, i loved this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,"no pve, removed most of the actuall good parts of ow1, doesn't deserve to exist"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,this is an unfair as jeff supposedly left as he actually still has a high role within the overwatch 2 community however the fact that it was announced a pve was then cancelled completely because they needed money so they gave us this which most of the things they did in overwatch 1 but removed everything which is what made it overwatch 2 a complete utter waste of time and its back to square one with the battle pass to grab more money but should be better in about 6 months time if not i want every necessary refund for the game and all the cosmetics because i am very cross with what they gave us. everything is now pay to play if you want to catch up to other people who already unlocked everything in which the game was designed for so that you can choose a character to counter others but they are locked this is unfair to people who play comp also
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,stopped playing a while ago. will never come back after recent events. this game is dead.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-29,cash grab at it's finest. people should stop supporting this scum of a company. they gave us overwatch 2 with less maps and a buggy launch. closing overwatch's 1 servers and they knew that they will scrap the pve way before telling the community. what a joke blizzard.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,"they just killed overwatch 1 with promises of bringing this new pve mode, and now they have just canceled it. it's just another sign of this new blizzard mess."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,"i will say that this game is a lot of fun to play, however me and other people who have been playing the game have been getting banned for no reason, so while the game is fun, do not waste money on buying stuff which could just go away out of no where and the support team has the attitude of the matter is resolved and it doesn't matter what you say, they will also change the reasoning for why you got banned,"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,this game is just a sad piece of  the characters are unbalanced too many stuns and a shop system that is just fishing for money overwatch 1 was giving me so much joy and overwatch 2 is with the shutdown of pve just a insult to the gaming community.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,"it is 2023, the game still needs to improve on its matchmaking and balancing of characters, while still allowing people to have fun. however it was nice of them to allow players from ow1 to transfer over all of their stuff, plus get a couple of bonuses. it doesn't deserve the 1.6 user score, and it definitely not a 8 out of 10. a 6 or 7 would be fair. update welp promises have been broken, pve with rpg elements will not happen. a great game with so much potential, is now slowly dying. also, why they haven't come back to twitch for esports is beyond me, the youtube exclusive deal was not smart. originally 6 stars, dropping it to 4. i would only recommend to play this game, if you have a large group of friends with similar ranks."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,"a large number of sound and game bugs. battlepass is terribly unprofitable. very expensive monetization. overpriced old skins. the developers spat in the face of the entire community of the game. update for may 2023 thanks for killing the first part. blizzard were able to do the impossible 1 killed the first part 2 completely monetized all game content 3 abandoned their main idea for the game, for which overwatch fans have been deprived of content since 2019. 4 killed the balance of teams and characters in the game 5 trampled and defecated on everything positive that was in overwatch. i wish blizzard ruin. you spit in the soul of a fan who played rock'n'roll racing on sega update for may 2023"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,"a truly unfortunate piece of work. i really love overwatch and blizzard, but i can't defend this situation either. there are many disadvantages to gameplay, but personally still find it fun but i was very disappointed by blizzard who sincerely waited for the pve content but saw the decision to cancel it.. i wonder how i can make such a good game like this situation... i have believed that blizzard will reflect on itself and improve on it in the game will be very good but i feel like i'm losing hope. at this rate, overwatch will have a big problem... please, i hope blizzard makes a big achievement without lying!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,"i've been an overwatch fan since beta 1, played this game like no other. i always been on blizzard's side but now i'm done. the kaplan's vision for overwatch 2 has been butchered to the point that it completely cancel the purpose of the lack of content in ow1. ow2 has indeed redefined the meaning of a sequel. it took away content from ow1 and just added a bad and abusive shop with a greedy battle pass. i've been hesitating to buy battlepasses and skins to help with the developement of the pve, but now, i won't drop a cent in this game just like ow1. they've been lying to us, again. i'm done with that. fk activision, fk blizzard and i hope y'all gonna get fired and replaced by microsoft"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-28,i have no reason to continue playing overwatch after the latest news with activision blizzard for lying to its own community. congrats you have officially ruined one of my favorite games! i can promise you this i will never come back to this game let alone any of activision blizzards games you have tarnished this games reputation. go  yourself activision blizzard you mother ers!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-27,"blizzard lied to usagain. what a surprise. i will never buy or pay a cent for a blizzard game again. they promised us a great pve campaign, what we got was an awful ingame shop with horrific prices, a mediocre premium battlepass and when we get a free skin, it looks like hot garbage pve was the only thing that could save this game. without pve its the death of overwatch. i really really really loved the first game, put over thousands of hours in it. but at this point i hope it fails, just because activision blizzard deserves all the misfortune of this world. sorry for the bad english and greetings from germany"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-27,"ive never had such an amazing experience with overwatch 1, ive been gaming for 20 years and building up a team of 6 regular players across my country to smash it out in overwatch was easily one of the most fun experiences ive ever had in gaming, the current state of the industry makes me feel like i will never taste anything close to that experience again"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-27,"a regressive sequel that fails its fans overwatch 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the beloved multiplayer shooter, falls disappointingly short of its predecessor. lack of progression, disregard for its customers, and the troubling decision to withhold promised pve content, while keeping the community in the dark. regression, not progression overwatch 2 fails to build upon the success of the original game, offering little in terms of innovation or meaningful changes well other then new shop and battle pass. it feels more like an incremental update rather than a true sequel, lacking the necessary advancements to justify its existence. zero respect for customers the developers of overwatch 2 have shown a concerning lack of respect for their dedicated fanbase several times. from poor communication to a lack of substantial content, it seems as though customer satisfaction is not and never was a priority. concealed cancelation of pve content one of the major attractions of overwatch 2 was its promised pve content. however, the developers knew well in advance that this feature would not be available, yet kept the community in the dark ! this deliberate omission further erodes trust and diminishes the game's credibility. in conclusion, overwatch 2 fails to deliver on its promises and falls short of the expectations set by its predecessor. the lack of progression, coupled with a disregard for customer satisfaction and the concealed cancelation of pve content, taints the game's and company's reputation even further. it is disheartening to witness a sequel that fails to live up to its potential and leaves loyal fans feeling betrayed and broken."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-26,"was waiting the pve content to review it, cant judge ow2 only based on the pvp part... but they cancelled it so no need to wait for it.... the game is worse than overwatch, more bugs, less fun, etc. 6v6 changed to 5v5 is really gimmicky. players are not rewarded properly and need to pay to have something... no more account level with cool level up effect. uiux from ow 1 was better and had vfx. basically the game is so bad that i missed the loot box system. loot box was not a good system but at least it gave the dopamine unlike battle pass levels.... and hardcore players can't keep their battle pass like in fortnite... should be renamed overfail..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-26,"overwatch 2 is a game that doesn't really exist, it is everything but overwatch 1 with a downgrade. 99 contents from that lovely trailer are gone, canceled, . the dev and the company lie to players on their face about the whole situation of pve modethey claim that the pve mode will release at the same year when ow2 is released, and they know it is not going to happen at all. disgusting, disgraceful, disrespectful."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-26,"i'm done. this doesn't need an explanation. literally canceling the biggest change comparing to ov1 that was meant to be in this game, a thing that could have been one of the most interesting changes in this entire game series. just uninstall it at this point, this  is not worth playing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-26,"truly not worth my time anymore. sad to see blizzard willingly dumpster such a great game, time and time again."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-26,"i didn't play in the ow 1 because i don't have a chance to buy a good  after release ow2 i buy a good pc to handle it. it's not worth it.i watched a lot ow1 videos and was impressed but after playing in ow2 i was disappointed.everything feels same but more emptier.less characters 5v5,no game play innovations,and the fact that if you new in ow2 then you will have nothing for months,only in events you will have some stuff like epic skins or sprays but that's  should pay for anything you liked in ow1like old emotes or sprays.battle pass is horse's ass.nothing interesting.just some sprays and voice lines.paying for only get mythic skin is not worth  whole ow team is focused on skins not gameplay skins.that so sad.more sad that we can't even play in ow1  died too early."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-25,"i used to have so much passion and love for this game. played it for 67 years. jeff kaplan leaving the dev team should have been the writing on the wall. in 2023 this game is devoid of life, meaning, or reasons to play. the matchmaking intentionally wants to upset you into interacting with the store. the store is highly overpriced with most skins being 20 for simple palette swaps. no custom games. no onfire system. leveling system is worse. they have nurtured everything good about overwatch and awkwardly jammed in mobilegame levels of greedy underhanded monetization. the devs clearly have no vision and the game exists only as a worthless cash grab. many times the ow2 devs have just straight up lied to the audiences face and anyone with a shred of self respect should take it no more. especially after the recent announcement to scrap planned pve modes and other content. blizzard has irreparably ruined this game. you can't even play the og game anymore. goodbye overwatch, you will be missed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-25,",      !       !!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-25,"lets get one thing straight this game doesn't exist or at least has no right to call itself a squeal its legitimately a rug pull as they used the promises of content such as massive repayable coop pve, a complete story, and hero missions with progression to justify its existence when in reality we all know they just wanted to brake into the free to play battlepass live service bs and couldn't do it without violating some terms of service and promises they made. they opted to throw on a fresh coat of paint and try to sell and i do mean sell as free to play games cost you something ether time or money to invest in and in blizzards case you can look at the  battlepass as an example of that. i doubt they had any intention of releasing any of the pve content to begin with and the pathetic excuse of loosing focus is just insulting to the fans when you follow that up with so we are left with another difficult choice do we continue to pour all that effort into pve eerr umm hoping we can land it at some point in the future, or do we stick with this set of values we have aligned on and focus on the live game and focus on serving all of you bro just had a freudian slip he is literally telling the players we had to pick between trash battlepass and optimization of live service and the actual content that you are looking forward  is that a difficult choice. blizzard deserves every bit of flack they are getting and much more for insulting there fans overwatch 2 is going to die a slow painful death as they try to monetize the corpse of a 7 year old game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-25,overwatch 2 is a cash grab game made only to introduce abysmal battle pass and payed skins. it is a very bad nonupdate for a base game that already had enough problems. the developers clearly don't care about the fans or the quality of their product. they just want to milk the franchise for as long as possible. overwatch 2 is a waste of time and money. do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage at all costs.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,this game is literally fraud in the most realistic sense. blizzard took peoples money and did not deliver what was promised. do not support them ever!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"took a great game, made it pay to win, lied about everything it would deliver in return. absolute trash.  you blizzard"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"pve being removed is a rug pull essentially because people spent money on the game the microtransactions and different editions, i know the game itself is free in anticipation of the pve. worst balancing i have ever seen in a game ever which is such a difficult title to earn. every hero rework literally made them worse. new support that just came out lifeweaver should be in alpha testing and not a full release hero. 5v5 was an utter disaster, everyone thought it would make the game more balanced and casual friendly but it had the exact opposite affect. the game is extremely poorly balanced because before you would have a second tank to help maintain space and mitigate dps effectiveness. now if a dps gets on a high ground with a pocket you basically have to split the sea in half to get them off."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"the whole gimmick for this game coming out was the pve, that was the reason it's overwatch 2 and not an update. so after 4 years the game is released in a half baked state and now pve gets cancelled. what is the  point? what has happened to gaming that this is what devs are able to pull this bs?"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"i had so much hope for this game. blizzard specifically gave us so much to look forward to, and then they snatched it away. they snatched it away in the worst way possible, waiting several months to announce their game ending decisions. something that would have hurt their sales and currently is hurting their sales. i for one would have never put any money in had i known the pve content they promised was never coming. do not trust anything they say, they are renowned liars and i wouldn't be surprised if a class action lawsuit came up from this."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"this is without a doubt the best example on how to completely ruin a franchise and a game that has been one of the best pvp experiences ive ever had. there isnt a single thing that deserves the 2 in ow 2  its a downgrade in every aspect. 5v5, no possibility to get any skins or cosmetics whatsoever cause you have to pay 20!!!! for a single mediocre skin, the progression system is now a battlepass and one of the worst battlepasses ive ever seen, new heros are locked behind a paywall or massive grind so if a hero is now meta and you want to play competetive yeah youre screwed and the list goes on and  only that they did with this game was a shopupgrade and thats it. its still overwatch 1 but with less content and now the only thing they promised that would justify the sequel was now scrapped. yeah they totally scrapped the pve content  this was just a corporate decision cause that would not get enough revenue and they knew that even before ow 2 was released but decided to not say a thing. blizzard is now without a doubt the worst company on the planet even worse than ea and that means  i could give this game a minus score i would but now its only at a 0."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"literally just small improvements with allot of things taken out of the game. they took 3 years to improve the shop and scrap the pve elemental, which was supposed to be the core point of literally making a sequel."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"i think the game itself is great, but what the sequel brings, is the worst in video game history. they stopped updating the game for years, made you pay for skins, and made it difficult to unlock heroes unless you pay for them. on top that they basically scrapped most of the pve stuff they planned, so there is literally no point in calling this a sequel for marketing purposes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"i dont usually rate games so heavily on the negative side. to have such a low score would require a game to be so broken and riddled with bugs to the point of not being playable. this is not the case, overwatch i refuse to use the 2 is a good looking game with brilliant gameplay and really cool character designs. the issue is the malpractice and scammyscummy attitude that blizzard has towards its players. to void my purchase of overwatch in the name of a sequel that promised substantial pve content, to then scrap the whole thing and leave us with the same game minus a ton of features, with the addition a ridiculously priced cosmetics store and a half assed battlepass is beyond anti consumer. i dont know whats going on with blizzard but to be honest i dont care to find out. what i know for a fact is that you cannot invest in any of their games, if you want to play them for free go ahead, but my advice would be to not buy cosmetics, battlepass, etc because they can kill a game with no warning. it happened with heroes of the storm, it happened with hearthstone mercenaries, and now its happening to overwatch. as consumers we deserve better."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,i created an account on this site just to rate this game negatively i hope that says enough.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,overwatch 2 is now officially nothing more than a cashshop update. they really deserve an award. ruining a game with this much potential requires an extraordinary amount of incompetence and greed. i will boycott activisionblizzard until they get their  together and i hope you will too.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"i owned ow1. the last update is so engaging that it incited me to play other games again. the problems are, in no particular order extreme monetization, massive amount of cheaters about half the games, no deterrent to prevent cheating, boosting or deranking. balancing is atrocious, the new ranking system only favors the players whose team can achieve consistent winning streaks. there are no correction mechanism if you loose because the other team had cheaters who were reported and caught, or if a member of your team throws the game. single player who try to rank without friends literally play nowin games regardless of the context. this game is the equivalent of a british robin reliant look at videos of jeremy clarkson taking sharp turns. blizzardmicrosoft also killed the pve twice, which is quite an achievement."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"avoid at all cost, broken game with less functionality than predecessor, if someone makes a lawsuit i am with it!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,"made an account at metacritic just to say blizzard team what a piece of  you have become. cash grab every chance you get, offer us garbage and think people will just accept it. hopefully everyone will boycott playing ow2 until the dev's can get their heads out of their asses and give us some actual worthwhile content for stealing a game that we already paid for and replacing it with garbage. i really get the feeling deep down they planned this  ever since the day kaplan left and knew it was the only way to get people to play ow2 was to steal and destroy ow1 and force us to this  pve is canceled. hopefully blizzard next."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-24,blizzard and the devs found a way to disappoint me even with low expectations. the game is pointless and now we don't even get pve. i'm disappointed and a little sad to be honest and will no longer be playing.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-23,"broken promises! lied about pve just to sell skins and battle passes they don't care about ow1 fan base! it's time to move on, f you blizzard!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-23,"playing overwatch 1 and 2. i have around 800 hours in this game. i made an account just to tell you why you shouldn't play overwatch 2. the promised pve, storylines, coop for 3 years. they just canceled it. on top of this the game is currently unbalanced with widowhanzo aka 1 hit heros completely dominating the game and ruining the fun. being 1 hit half the time you peek a corner isn't fun and i find myself not wanting to play anymore. it's too bad because this game used to be fun. now it's a who can snipe better game aka sniperwatch."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-23,"ow2 is scam money grabbing turd . after many requests for a refund, blizzard took action againt my account and threatened to perma ban me if i kept protesting my posotion. from a gm we would like to make it clear that the resolutions youve received will be the only one we can offer as a business. while we understand, and welcome, additional contacts that further clarify a situation, there comes a point where the outcome were providing is the correct one for us as a game studio disgusting customer service."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"overwatch is a fun, game. i in fact have spent over 100 hours in this game, something i don't do often. the problem is, its just  overwatch. the game is losing its charm, and blizzard is selling out. i can not say this is a good upgrade, because it is not even an upgrade, don't worry though, because the pve will come out, sometime in like 6 months. edit appears that the last couple of years blizzard said was being invested in the pve got canceled, this game is not only a scam, but an insult to those who played the game. i have to feel sorry to those who invested there time in this game. absoulte embarrassment, this was the one and only point to overwatch 2, not the pvp, but the pve. what a let down."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"that game is amazing. not the sequel, exactly. i mean the core  since is my first time playing it. rich characters, interesting lore, deep gameplay and mechanics, charismatic content creators, amazing ost, and the communication with the community is getting better. season 3 is the right move. unfortunately, since i completed my graduation, i had to let some games go to dedicate to my career, but if this game was discovered for me when i was 15yo... dude, i would be playing 247. addition this review was made before i knew that pve was cancelled  at least, the way it should be. also, it's not right to give this game a high score when the merit behind is from another game. for this reason, i'm reducing it to 3."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"don't be fooled by the two at the end of the games name, it's not a real sequel. to date nothing of value has been added to justify it being called anything other than a terrible expansion and even calling it an expansion is misleading. in fact the original no longer exists for purchase. at it's core it's the same game except some removed game modes, one add mode and competitive being changed from a 6v6 to a 5v5 without properly rebalancing for it. the planned story mode was a bait and switch lie with what little pve story stuff coming likely speculated to be just what they have been doing before, only out for anniversary and not available year round. there has been no real improvements since launch. the progression's emphasis on the terrible battlepass and store that is somehow worse than halo infinite's. avoid at all costs."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"failed promises on launch, gameplay that is simply not an improvement over the first installment, lack of new content and digusting 'micro' transactions were not enough. the big argument for actually calling this overwatch 2 has been cut down to such a degree that it in no way resembles what was promised, and what remains of the game is lacking in quality and content. why would anyone ever again give money to this shameless cash grabbing company?"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,no promised features. a bad reskin with no soul and no new features. just a quick crash grab produced by the rotting corpse of a studio who used to be one of the betters.  blizzard.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"thank you blizzard for removing the game we paid for, and replacing it with a worse version with focus on microtransactions and battle passes, that nobody wanted. i would gladly have paid for ow2 just for for the pve, but that is nothing but a long gone dream now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"i already didn't like overwatch 2 compared to overwatch 1, i dont like the balance changes, i dont like the meta, i dont like the changes to the heroes, its missing a bunch of features, like medals, they made it a lot less inclined to communicate with teammates. it feels like the beta for overwatch 1. so i stopped playing for a while, i came back to give it another chance, was having a mid time, and then they canceled, massively scaled back the only things i was looking forward to, and imo the only things keeping the franchise alive, a few days later. screw blizzard, screw this game. don't waste your time, and if you give it a try do not pay for anything. they don't deserve it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-22,"i don't know why blizzard decide to kill overwatch. in the battle pass logic, games have always been hated by players except some games. but they are keep ruining the games out of the passion for making money rather than the passion for game development. developers get what they deserve. i missed old fun overwatch but you guys just decided to killed it. congratulations on your mindblowing and very clever decision !"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,they just canceled the promised pve. the main selling point for ow2 and why they took away ow1 from us long time players! i'm so glad i quit after season 1 of ow2 and unsubbed from every social media channel of this  show! bad greedy management ruining games and punching fans in the face.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,"this game was advertised, teased, and shown to be a sequel to overwatch 1 with promises of pve content, campaigns, and engaging materials of the like. overwatch 1 was deleted in order to make room for overwatch 2, meaning the previous version of the game is now completely gone. none of the advertised materials of overwatch 2 were delivered. moreover, many things people considered good about overwatch 1 were completely absent from 2, making this new game a downgrade. this is blatantly false advertising, an illegal practice. blizzard has outright committed false advertising in order to sell their produce. this is against the law in many countries."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,"nah blizzard you  up this time, first your expensive skins and now pve canceled"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,"very sad, overwatch  predatory microtransactions  edition. i am so saddened and disgustes big l"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,"blizzard lied. it was never about making pve content, it was about changing the monetization. there are insiders that leaked that blizzard already knew that there wasn't going to be pve even when they released the game, it is pretty easy to guess why they only announced it now and not when they knew."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,le jeu est bien. mais c'est une arnaque immense d'une entreprise qui dteste ses joueurs ou en tout cas je ne vois pas d'autre explication.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-21,"thx blizzard for making us wait 4 years for nothing. oh, i have an idea how about putting number 2 on the game and making skins 20 to milk the stupid player, the casuals, and the kids. ......what? an old fans and players who pay 60 to the game and support us? screw them!!! the sad part is that there are players nongamers who pay stuff like  he simply don't give a  that blizzard is milking him. wtf my 2nd best game went to the worst game that existed, god, i hate casuals and kids. they always ruin everything, i hoped ow did not get popular. old player will relate"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,killed oke of the best games ever for this horse  i truly hate you blizzard.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"this is not a new game, but a cashgrab update to overwatch 1. the justification for ow2 was to introduce allnew substantial player vs. enemy gameplay pve, but that was just unceremoniously cancelled. the only reason ow2 was launched was to squeeze more money out of the ip with 40 battle passes and 20 skins. the quality and integrity of the game is gone. now ow2 is simply a worse version of ow1 with a predatory shop and battle pass, and terrible matchmaking. you will struggle to get fair matches. if you play 10 games, 4 will be unwinnable, 4 will be unlosable, and 2 will be close, but frustrating and not fun."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,quack my sack and bring pve back.  you blizzard and  your lazy devs that did nothing for the past 4 years
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"i played this game for 7 years ,bought watchpoint pack,bought all the battle pass, bought the nonsense expensive skin in ow2 to support the dev to develope the ambitious pve that they promise for the last 3 years up now what we got is  scamwatch2  i'm done defending this game or this dev man.i'm done for this game too. this is a last goodbye and don't even think that i'll be coming back to this scam ever again. disappointed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"whoever rates this game above 0, may still not know blizzard announce the removal of 95 of the pve they promised."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"instead of making content, you start to make roadmap. 3 years without content for making 1 balance patch and pack of  cosmetics and promise of making pve campaign. which one you broke. and i don't even speak about your worsethanlootbox monetisation. blizzard deserves to be closed"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,blizzard defined a sequel alright by making this player versus exploitation
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"here we are at overwatch 1 update 922, with developers already saying this is renewed garbage"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"i don't like having to leave this review, but i am glad i could give it a 0 as 1 would have been too much as we now basically have the same game as 7 years ago but in a much worse state. there have been so many bad decisions with this game, so many lies and disinformation. after all of these years since ow1 i'm calling it a day, well done blizzard for ruining your franchise, at least your reputation couldn't get much worse."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"it should actually be named overwatch 1.5, there was no actual improvement from the first one, they could have just gone f2p and then updated to new consoles, even though it looks exactly the same. the change to 5vs5 does not justify the upgrade. on top of that, pve got cancelled, that would have been overwatch 2, not what was delivered."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-20,"quite frankly, this is an inferior version of overwatch. the game was a massive disappointment and i lost interest half way through season 2. previously played every season of overwatch 1, but once this came out i just found it boring in comparison. tanking was no longer enjoyable, support felt lacklustre, and i never really play damage so can't comment. the game removed any sense of achievement that overwatch 1 gave, no on fire, portrait borders were gone, ranking up and down was confusing and the surprise of opening a gift every level up no longer existed. they somehow managed to turn the gameplay from feeling like a fun shooter into something that felt like a colourful day job. once i lost interest in the pvp i was biding my time until the pve mode released as the proposed game looked excellent. sadly this is no longer coming to the level that they originally promised, and looks to be more of a token gesture so that they don't get sued for false advertising, so i probably won't be returning to overwatch. rip"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,no pve then what is the reason you guys purchase overwatch 2?pve is a promise to every other player.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"not delivering their promise on a campaign and a solid foundation of pve, intentionally scammed their player base with a false hope  that they never planned on delivering. do not waste your money on this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"they left ow1 without content for 1 and a half year, killed it, the launch ow2 in an incomplete state only to cancel the only content thing i was looking forward to. blizzard is that one best friend that you really liked to hang out on elementary school, but then you find out hes a crack addict as an adult. dont play this games. play apex legends, and if you want a sp experience, play titanfall 2. dont waste your time with this sorry excuse ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,there really isn't much to say. the game is not what they promised at all. only reason i'd consider playing this game is if the full pve experience they promised were to release

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,canceled pve mode!? this make me and the community very disappointed. and the game itself kinda same as old overwatch1
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"gameplay is worse than overwatch 1. some features were added but it was not enough, it is not good. it is not worth it. main reason overwatch 2 was made is because of incoming pve coop story mode, which was week ago canceled and we found out they already cancel it in their dev team even before release of ow2. new coming up story coop mode, should be small coop missions which you can get by purchasing battlepass. overprized shop with very shady offers. shady develpoers, shady publisher. fales advertisment. gameplay not fun, competitive mode is broken when it comes to matchmaking and ranking up, so there is not reason to play it. very big dissapointing game. hope it already ends burning so we can move on and stop being sad about being lied and got our money taken out of our wallet. weve got scamed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"well, pve is canceled....... rainbow six siege is better than overwatch 2. change my mind. yeah that is my opinion for overwatch two. nothing more nothing less."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"from the beginning this game has always felt like overwatch 0.5, from the removal of loot boxes and the leveling system to even little things like the removal of the card system at the end of every map this game has been a big step back fro what made overwatch 1 so enjoyable. the only reason this game is free to play is to justify taking away the 1st game and to force us to have to buy skins or grind weekly challenges for months on end. on top of that the pve is now cancelled and the only hope i ever had for this game has gone. this game is one big glorified cash grab from blizzard and they have lost all respect not just from me but, as you can see from the 1.5 user score, from the majority of the fans as well. play tf2 instead."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"if you hate yourself play this game it has everything you need, toxic community and  devs"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"this game is basically just a scam. that they killed the original ow by forcing it into an update that introduced aggressive microtransactions is one thing, that they rebalanced the game in a way that basically destroyed half of its mechanics is something that other people might not consider as much of a problem as i do, but that they literally lied to the entire player community about the scrapped core content of the game, with the attempt of fooling as many people as possible into spending money on the overpriced cash shop  that they knew would be dead anyway at the very moment of its release is literally a case for the justice system. i have never seen a rugpull of this scale within the videogame industry in my entire life. stay as far away from this scam as you possible can!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"honestly i loved overwatch 1, i played daily with friends for years, i have the gaming light, i must have about 10 funko pops, i had almost every skin, i even worked in an open kitchen and would speak to random customers about gaming and overwatch, add them on battletag, game with them and make new friends. on week 1 to maybe about a month in on overwatch 2 me and about 5 friends quit for good i've came back once or twice but literally leave after a game or 2 i went from looking forward to playing the game almost daily with friends for years, to literally having 0 desire to login. skipped the halloween event and christmas event which normally i'd really look forward to 'new skins' etc. i always wanted ow1 classic to come back but now with the news after four  years of announcing pve you cancel it, i don't want anything to do with this game or company again, honestly a massive  you to blizzard, completely destroyed something that was great and removed it for everyone despite us all paying money for it........... absolute criminal 010 0100 fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"the pve mode was the only justification for this battle pass infected garbage. they removed ow1 and started selling heroes, a thing that they said they would never do, and now they removed the pve from the game. honestly, this was the last time that this company rugpulled me. i was super hyped for the new diablo, but im never gonna spend a single dime on any product they create. playing their free to play content is not fun anymore, paying for anything they do means that they will most likely run away with you money without delivering anything."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-19,"a downgraded version of ow1 in almost every possible way, even moreso now that the pve aspect has been completely scrapped which many were led to believe was the whole reason for ow2"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"blizzard has completely killed the whole point of overwatch 2 existing, they made took the pve and turned it from a complete, replayable, hero based campaign with levels and diverse skill trees, to a small piece of story every couple seasons tied in with the live service pvp, that is basically a cutscene in the beginning, play a mini game where you kill bland robot enemies and try to get the highest score possible passable design 30 years ago, then get an end cutscene, and that's it for the next 4 months, and they knew it would be like this for over half a year, completely deceiving their player base. as someone who has played the game since the beta in 2016, i was looking forward to the pve to draw me back in, overwatch got really old for me around the end of 2018beginning of 2019, so when pve was announced during blizzcon 2019, i was stoked, since i always wanted a story mode pve, since the cinematic trailers were so good, now there's no reason to come back, i feel betrayed, and i just don't see why anyone who has played the game for as long as i have, to ever want to play it again, i mean, i made a metacritic account just to write this, i never been that disappointed in a game before. r.i.p overwatch"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,pve has been officially scrapped. pve was the only reason i bought this game. blizzard really has lost their way.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"relaunching the same game only with minor changes, freetoplay and filled to the brim with microtransactions was an genius decision! good job, blizzard and team overwatch!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,the whole point of adding the 2 was the new pve mode not your  store battlepass 5v5 you should've let this game die in 2019 but hey atleast i can watch this game die in 20232024 i can't wait!!!!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,der komplette pve modus was dem spiel eigentlich jeder existenz berechtigt nimmt und damit nicht nur keine wurdigerenachvolger sondern wir auch von blizzard belogen worden sind
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,super glad i didn't buy into the leadership of blizzard with this. blizzard decided to not invest in pve before they ended overwatch 1. blizzard should never be trusted in any future content.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"overwatch 2 made the pvp less fun for me, i geuss some ppl like having the 1 less tank but i hate it i used to love flanking with raodhog while a main tank helped the team thats dead now. and then the big one the pve mode i was hyped for and the only reason i had overwatch still installed, but that got killed of so they can focus on pvp mode."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,false advertisementbeing lied to by a company. i invested in this game to get the pve that was promised. now we learn that they knew they were going to scrap what they advertised before the game was released and people paid money. below is the game stop articleinterview with proof httpswww.gamespot.comarticlesoverwatch2spvemodeisbeingscrappedblizzardexplainswhathappenedandwhy11006514242
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"none of the features promised for this sequel were delivered, specially the pve content edit now officially canceled. the game was impossible to play at launch and for weeks later. some well known heroes were removed from the game for weeks because of game breaking bugs. some game breaking bugs are still there since the launch, never adressed. finally, the monetization is the most predatory one can possible think of."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,4 years of nothing 4  years guys let me use an example the fnaf movie was promised for 8 years instead of quitting like a  they made it they stoped after 4 years jeff we need you
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"at first, it was cool, look guys no flashbang, no more same comps like rein zarya on repeat, not a lot of shields, a bit faster gameplay, kinda cool. but then the honeymoon phase ended, and it was a honeymoon that was caused out of excitement only. look we are finally getting something! overwatch 2 should have been named overwatch 0.5 because we actually ended up with less. who is to blame? company greed and whiny players, especially those who encourage this system by continuing to throw money at it. 4  6 weeks in, i quit, and in those weeks, there was a series of quit points. skins are overpriced? whatever. the skins i could get for free in the game i purchased are now locked behind a pay wall? tolerable. i get flamed now for being the only tank? i can deal with it. i get less peel now? not as enjoyable, but skill issue i guess. lucio is a feeble character that can't hold his own now? not really fun. the new and blandest character to mankind, sojourn, oneshots me when she feels like it? hmm. i almost killed this guy but kiriko tp'd through a wall and they bent me over? hmmm. every team is just running the same comp now because its broken and it won't get fixed for months? hmmm. i have to play rein to stand a chance against the zarya who will now swap to wintson to continue to dominate me? hmmm. there is a more guns blazing, less teamwork feeling to the game now. if i wanted that i would have been playing something else. to anyone involved in allowing this atrocity, i hate you."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"algumas mudanas so realmente boas, reduzir o nmero de jogadores de 6 pra 5 deixa o jogo mais balanceado, o novo sistema de ranked  bom, o fato de deletarem as loot box  timo, e tambm o free 2 play  sempre excelente. porm tirando isso, agora que cancelaram o lanamento do pve  praticamente o mesmo jogo, o fato de ter um 2 na frente  nada mais do que uma jogada de marketing pra tentar ressuscitar o jogo."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,the years i have dedicated to this game in hope makes me feel embarrassed now.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"what a scam. no pve so why overwatch? this was a huge cashgrab, no new pve but we get shop skins and battlepass.  company really, what way to spit in the faces of your loving fans."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,trash pointless sequel. this game was blizzards justification for deleting ow1 and it is literally a downgrade of that game with a paid item shop.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,how is this even allowed? how are they literally allowed to sell us on this idea and kill the old game to push a new overwatch 2 out and then not deliver the game? why why why why did you delete overwatch 1
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"it has recently become clear that overwatch 2 is essentially a monetization update. every player was looking forward to the pve announced in 2019. no one wants the pve events like archives from ow1. it is obvious that they  the original pve vision to solely focus on trying to scrap every dollar they can from their loyal players with the new battle pass system. its also incredibly scummy that blizzard knew for over a year that the original epic pve vision from 2019 was no longer going to be released. yet they are just telling us this now?! myself and so many others got back into the game because we were excited for the pve that had been advertised and justified the sequel. now we all just feel scammed and legitimately lied to for the sake of profit. what they did should be illegal and i wish they could be sued and answer for their scummy predatory tactics. its sad and disappointing that the leadership at blizzard scrapped something everyone was so excited for due to greed and poor management. to be clear, i dont blame the devs for any of this, they dont make these type of decisions. i feel bad for them that they poured so much work into something we will never be able to experience. ive been an overwatch fan since 2016 when the game first came out. however, i cannot in good conscience support this game or this company after seeing their greedy scummy and predatory tactics used again and again. this was the nail in the coffin for me. i have uninstalled the game and will not be playing again unless something drastically changes. sad day to have been an overwatch fan."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"terribly mismanaged game, developer lying to players about canceled content."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"only reason many people gave overwatch 2 a chance was the campaign pve mode. now that this game will no longer have that campaign mode and all the story they promised will be cut up into limited time events . i have already uninstalled this game, along with many others. don't keep playing this game and don't give blizzard your money for this game, overwatch 2 deserves to die at this point."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"i loved overwatch 2. after all the stupid changes they made to the game, i stopped playing. i was looking forward to playing the overwatch 2 pve content, but now that we're not getting what was promised, this game is dead to me. how do you kill the goose that laid the golden egg?! i can see why jeff kaplan left now. he saw this mess coming and got out. so much is wrong with this game. no more 6v6, and one of the tanks, mauga, that i was really looking forward to since he is a former friend and comradeinarms of baptiste, is nowhere to be found! we got a dumb looking transforming robot. i'm honestly hoping blizzard ends up getting gutted and dissolved as a company. blizzard has lost its soul and it's already dead, might as well put it out of its misery like old yeller for real."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,blizzard is simply lying in our faces trying to get our cash. the 2 in the name is them spitting in our faces
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,fck this game. fck activision. fck these devs. bunch of fking liars. hope this game sinks.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"false marketing and lies from the devs about story mode they ruined the game to make more money from it. in conclusion free hong kong, taiwan is the real china."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"i have been playing overwatch since the beta. i can no longer play this game. any time i try its just 1 round and realize how bad the match making has become. i was hoping the pve would be something i would want to play but its no longer coming out as promised. blizzard and activision are scamming all of us. i'm done with this game, what a great disappointment. gg"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,never going to play this game. they took my overwatch and forced me to this and now no pve. we all wanted the story! without this isnt a sequel but a cash grab. it should be called overwatchreforged
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"this game deserves all of its backlash. when you underdeliver on the entire reason why the product exists in the first place, youre going to lose your fanbase."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,their whole reasoning of making an overwatch sequel being cancelled and the same old gameupdates being ported over and reforged with f2p aspects such as battlepasses just makes this another forgetable game like all the other old generic f2p games in 2012. the soul of this game franchise isnt there anymore promises are failed to be met.... heck overwatch as a whole came from a failed project. lots of people preordered ow2 and it just feels pretty scammy to justify this game as the product they ordered. the pve mode was their whole reasoning of shutting down overwatch 1 servers.... now its become just overwatch reforged. o7
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"waited years to play the promised pve gamemode to come out, for them to completely scrap the idea"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"the game is literally overwatch 1 but everything fun scrapped, your hard work tossed in the garbage in favor for a wallet wins everything shop. constant bugs, lacking features other games have had for years, and constant let down of what little fans they have left. now they gut the one thing that made this game separate from the prequel. this is not a game, it deserves to be in vegas because all it does is scam you for your time hard work and money, giving sadness and despair in return. do not play."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,the promised overwatch 2 was specifically the pve content. now that story is dead in favor of a monetized system of seasonal battle passes. they figured well they can't make consistent money on a box priced game. they prefer to stick to a battle pass system and scrap pve all together. we need jeff back!!! save us!!!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"i am so disappointed in this game, from the monetization to the lack of any meaningful content except new heroes and a couple of new maps. the same events over and over again every holiday without any major updates. and now the gutting of the pve mode is so disappointing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"the game itself is okgood. but the policy behind it is terrible. ow2 was supposed to be a pve with pvp game. then it was pvp with pve soon. now they canceled the reason why they made a part two in first place, the pve mode and the reason why i bought it in the first place. i payed for the pve mode and payed for the pvp mode twice instead."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"blizzard with their  game, hope bobby kotick will be dead soon"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"cancelling a core promised deliverable? don't announce something you can't deliver please. remove the 2 from 'overwatch 2'. i lost most of my interest in playing ow2 when the heroes got locked behind a paywall, this is the nail in the coffin."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"jogo extremamente viciante, mas deveria ter um balanceamento melhor. as partidas so extremamente difceis ou extremamente fceis"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,what is even the point of this game when blizzard just canceled the pve mode
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"i have played for years the first overwatch and i must say, what they have done to this game is very sad. they not only have made worse the micro transactions on this new game but now they abandoned the pve mode which by the way was the only reason they had to call this game a sequel. seriously, what to expect to a game that make you wish to have the loot boxes back again? i really loved the first overwatch and i really wanted to play the second, but i dont and i will not support a game that doesnt care about the players and fans."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,thanks blizzard i wait 4 years for nothing happene at all .you destroy your game like the other games you have .
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-18,"i'm so done with this game, lots of broken promises and lots of decisions that made ow2 so shxt and today they announced that the pve they'd promised got cancelled? at this point the 2 doesn't mean anything at all it's more like ow 0.5 that is worse than ow 1, apparently they use all the money to make more stupid skins but can't develop the pve, eh? i really feel being scammed and there's no words other than disappointment, everytime they have some bad news like when j allen brack gave the most insincere and just a single word sorry when they withdrew the prize money of the hong kong player they would announce something else right after for distraction and this time is the exact same thing, announcing the cancellation of pve while showing us other advertising materials."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"a blatant lie in the game's advertising campaign. thanks for the great pve. i was very optimistic, expecting that the coop mode is about to come out and the game will get a second wind. at the end, i just want to say r.i.p. overwatch 2, you were killed for bp and 20 skins. i am uninstalling the game and i advise everyone to do the same."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"this game is just pay to win now. either you pay 10 or you have to play round about 50 hrs just to get a new hero. if a hero has a game breaking bug it takes them weeks to fix it, which also means that the hero isn't available for said time. and now they also canceled the promised pve mode, so it's just a cash grab game now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"biggest cash grab of the year, possibly the decade... there is no reason to play this"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"thank u blizzard for cancel ow2 pve , now will have the same game with another engine, more micro transactions for a recolor with a wig, a new game mode no one likes push the robot and horrible matchmaking. i expected a new game and i only receive one dlc with a shop rework."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"as someone who has tried overwatch 2, i must say that i am deeply disappointed. the game promised to deliver an innovative and exciting experience, but it seems that blizzard has failed to live up to their promises. in particular, the highly anticipated pve mode will no longer be released. it's truly disheartening to see blizzard neglecting to complete the pve mode, especially since it was one of the main reasons players were looking forward to the game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"i was optimistic. not anymore... r.i.p. overwatch, killed by overwatch 2"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"i have been playing overwatch since its release and i loved the game until 2019. then the game stopped developing in any way and the only thing that was added was a couple of new skins that you could buy with saved coins or get with the help of the loot boxes. suspended development of the game defended that they are diligently working on a new part where everything will change, new maps, heroes, pve mode and many other things will be added. since the launch of overwatch version 2.0, everything has started to fall apart. by canceling the older version of overwatch into several thousand queues for four days. when you were among the lucky ones who managed to log in to overwatch in the first few days, you found out that there is no no pve mode in the game that they promised us and for which reason overwatch 2 was made and loot boxes with profile leveling disappeared the only way to get cosmetics in the game for free with no payment. they added absolutely pathetic battlepasses and of course a shop where you can buy a badge you won't even see in the game for 10 more expensive than if you bought it in real life. for each season, i make trailers for what will be in the new season and what skins will be there, except that you have to buy 70 of the content in the store, 20 is the battlepass and the remaining 10 is for mortals, which is one map and one skin per play for months so you don't cry because you have nothing. oh, and not to forget to get the newly added heroes you have to either buy a battlepass to get them immediately or grinding to level 45. and you don't know yet that earning a level is quite tedious and you can spend more than 50 hours of time to complete the weekly quests yes, they are outrageously boring and keep repeating themselves. for weekly quests, you will receive 60 coins each week after completion. for comparison, battlepas cost 1000 coin and legendary skins cost 1000 and above.well, what do we have in the finale and why am i writing this at all? you had 5 years to do what you promised us, and on may 17 i learned that you are canceling the pve that you promised us for 5 years? what on earth have you been doing all this time? i have the feeling that one and a half people are working on overwatch. why are you telling us now? what's the point of half a year from ubdait overwatch to number 2? for peace of mind, you released the road map again, but in that map i only saw what i was supposed to gain from 2019 until now. i will not discuss other aspects of why this game is bad, such as player toxicity or poorly made balance or still unfixed bugs since launch. you have not only broken the bottom, you are already running around and making everything worse and worse. i hope that whoever is responsible for this disaster bears the punishment he deserves. blizard is no longer a company of hope, quality and fun for me. for me, blizard has become an incompetent, lying, outrageously stingy company that i haven't experienced in my lifetime. peace players."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"not based purely on the quality of the game, but it's a 0 for the bad management that blizzard is having on the game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"if i could i would like go back to overwatch 1. this game is micro transaction trash, killed by developer. i hate blizzard so much."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,i rather go back to overwatch 1 if i could. the greed and just overwhelming lack of new content is mindblowing. the world could always use more heroes yeah if you have a fat sack of money every 3 months otherwise screw you here is your second job. also the main selling point of the game is canceled so i don't see a reason to even bother to play anymore.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"blizzard. pve was cancelled for more useless, boring, pvp content. someone needs to scream in the ow2's developers face's that battle passes are not content. now ow2 truly is just a patch and nothing more. no wonder jeff left. blizzard will continue to exist off the money from fomo andys and 6 year old's. never playing this trash again. blizzard has continued to make the worst decision possible at every turn. i pray that storm gate and poe put blizzard out of business so their greedy shareholders finally take a fing loss."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,huge wasted potential after killing off the much anticipated pve game mode so they can focus on selling ingame store garbage and battle passes everyone from the top to bottom at activision blizzard should be ashamed of themselves for grifting the community yet again a hard 0.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,pve       . blizzard    .
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"great game, which is owned by terrible company. without pve i dont see any new reason why i should play more, because all new mode was just boring e.g. starwatch is just terrbile. i feel like someone stole my 5 years of life. thanks, for bad mood blizzard"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,no pve mod? so the reason this version exists is to make it easier to release  clones for prnhub? i don't find any other reason here.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"overwatch 1 was delightful game, but overwatch 2 . overwatch 2 gives all new games terrible features like battle pass, monetization, heroes that are locked behind pay wall. and do you remember what blizzard promised you when they'd announced ow 2? they promised cross play between ow 1 and ow 2, a lot of new cool heroes, pve content and much more. what do you get? you get some small amount of  looking heroes that look alike those from cheap chinese games, you got terrible pay wall with hidden mechanics like the same icon for legacy credits and for their new premium currency, ty textures and terrible sound overhaul. now i get why jeff left blizzard before ow 2. i miss overwatch 1 and i'm sad that blizzard kill it and i can't play in it anymore"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"i use to love ow 1. i was the one who play even if they friends uninstalled the game. now i'm the first uninstalling it. ow2 , and its a shame. and they became worst with his falses promises about a pve history mode."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,3 year content drought. renamed ow2 to add a cash shop and battle pass. used pve as a means to hook people on launch when they had internally known they were canceling pve. the 2 in ow2 stands for monetization changes.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,this game is nothing but the work  game company that used to like making games but later gotten blinded by the money and lost their way.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"they promoted false advertisment saying that there would be a campaign, which was the main reason for calling it overwatch 2, and now they have announced that there will never be a full campaign as initially promised. instead there will be episodic pieces of a story that will be slowly drip dead to us. i'm done with overwatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"?  ?  ?       pve  ,     warcraft 3 refounded"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"this game has deceived its community in the most brazen way. let's start in order. 1. pve in 2019, at blizzcon, jeff kaplan announced overwatch 2, he said that it would be a leap into a new generation, that it would be a legendary game, and for the sake of its development, overwatch 1 would completely stop receiving new content, and all forces would be thrown at the implementation of a new game. the community of the game then agreed, because what was there to worry about? part 1 steadily received new heroes, maps, cinematics, and everyone was sure that our favorite campaign would not let us down. here in this waiting mode  game, with talents for heroes, cool cutscenes, a shallow plot, replayable dynamic pve on a huge world map that is constantly being updated. 19,20 and 21 years have passed in this standby mode. and now, in the 22nd year, overwatch 2 is finally announced to us. however, the players were upset as quickly as they were happy, because this is not a masterpiece promised to them, but only an update of the first part, with some balanced edits, several new heroes, etc. nothing comparable to promises. but the new game director of the game, aaron keller, promises that everything will still be, just not now. dear players, development is getting more expensive, buy a battle pass, we need money to finish the very game that we promised you  this is how many players perceived the release of overwatch 2 in the first part. but nevertheless, there was hope and faith in the great blizzard, which, yes, did not calculate its strength, but all the same, now we will give her some more money, and she will fulfill all her promises. what happened in the end? on may 16, 2023, aaron keller announced that pve was being canceled. and we will only get story missions, like those that we already received for the archive event in the first part. what can i say here, blizzard publicly signed her incapacity. for 3 years, this campaign did not do anything for overwatch, they just had a huge amount of free time, which they apparently spent just sitting in their luxurious offices and drinking coffee. or, another effective manager broke into the studio and said that no one needs pve, immediately do a free dump like fortnite or apex, so that with a battle pass, donat cosmetics, and so on. here we actually go to the second point. 2. monetization when overwatch came out, it was a premium game, it cost 2000rubles, and in return offered a complete absence of paytowin elements that are always present in free projects. and now, after 6 years, half of which the game was completely devoid of content, the developers suddenly announce that the game will be free. and as compensation for those who bought it for the full price tag, blizzard will give 2 epic looks, for the fist of death, general, and for sombra, fool, and the second look clearly made it clear for whom blizzard keeps people who pay her money. and so, overwatch became free, a battle pass appeared in it, all skins became paid and cost just cosmic money, 2000rubles for 1 legendary skin, 700 rubles for an epic one. the game has turned from a primal, highquality game from the famous blizzard, into another free dump, since in addition to donating, paytowin elements have also appeared in the game, namely, now new heroes are not opened at all at once, but after pumping out the 55 level of the battle pass, or buying its primal version which in itself is already absolutely unacceptable for a game for which many people gave their hardearned money. of course, overwatch 1 also had monetization, the same loot boxes, but they could be received for free, in a huge amount, in an hour you could get 12, and sometimes 3 loot boxes, just by playing the game. and in overwatch 2, in order to play the game to save up for a battle pass, you need to spend 17 weeks, for the sake of 8 legends and 1 mythical skin. in conclusion, i want to say that you should not believe this terrible office called blizzard, in no case do not bring money there, and do not support their terrible monetization. only by depriving them of money, you can achieve changes. i've been playing overwatch since 2018, 400 hours."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"i can't believe they really cancelled the only promising thing about overwatch 2, such a scam..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"overwatch 2 isn't a sequel, it's a malicious expansion. new heroes, new maps, new modes, the rest is the same. the foundation of this game is overwatch 1, which was a fun if not repetitive squadbased heroshooter game with cosmeticonly progression. overwatch 1 is good, but the 'new' aspects that make it overwatch 2 aren't. the core changes, planned to elevate overwatch 1 to overwatch 2, was the addition of talent systems, pve content and modes potentially adding new plot and lore to the game, and longterm progression. overwatch 2 released in a clear yet undisclosed 'early access' state where none of those new core changes existed. on launch ow2 had no pve content, no talent systems, and no longterm progression. the only changes made from overwatch 1 to overwatch 2 were a few new heroes, a few new maps, and a new game mode or two. the other, glaring change, was the change from a paytoplay model to a freetoplay model meaning overwatch 2 completely free to play, but now most of the unlockable content almost entirely cosmetic is paytoearn ditching the previous model of earning coins for loot boxes or outright buying certain cosmetics. now, fastforwarding almost a year since overwatch 2's release, those core new changes that were absent on launch have been officially scrapped by the development team. that means the aspects meant to elevate overwatch 1 to overwatch 2 no longer exist. in a direct quote from an ow2 dev what this means is that we won't be delivering that dedicated hero mode, those talent trees, that longterm progression. those things just aren't in our plans anymore.. overwatch 2 doesn't exist, so it gets a 0 from me. it's just overwatch 1 with a very lackluster expansion mascarading as a sequel."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,game is boring and this is not even continuation of the first game its just big update i had some good memories with this game that's why i give it 2 if not that it would be 0!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,game was canceled and they released cash grab pvp update and called it a new game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"this was enough. you were lying in our faces and now what? correct, you will get what you  deserve! you will get what you deserve!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,cancel overwatch 2 pve mode hahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"blizzard trying to make many on pve but it will be  , literally overwatch 2 is cancelled and it still bad game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"overwatch 2 is even less than overwatch 1. and why did they interrupt the release of content for 4 years? 4, carl! just an incredible shame. all blizzard is doing now is returning the good old overwatch to us without 2, but with f2p and battlepass  no more changes at all."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,it's just a scam. at this point there's no way around that. the main reason of the game's existence has been cancelled. corporate greed wins again.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"can you guys, like, stop sponsoring this game company? it's literally just a financial pyramid"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-17,"the developers can kill themselves, i don't care about this game and the company too. you lied to us for years. is this overwatch 2? i think it's not anymore, i think this is.. overwatch, but without number 2."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,from game of the year to game of the joke nice job blizzard! what a scam...
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"potato server  from pay to play became cash grab game  no free battle pass for ow 1 owners is discrimination  you no longer earn lootbox or even credit after playing, and they literary forced us to buy it with real money.  challenge mission is a joke.  they increased in game cosmetic price 75 became 350 350 became 1000 1000 became 1900 papa jeff trusted you, i thought i could too..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"ty blizz for 4 years of waiting, and for what? archives 2.0 d no talents, no heromission, no heroprogression... well done!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,baited the entire community back into the game with a promise of a fresh game mode that everyone been asking for just for you to push it back and back to just eventually cancel it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"scrapped the whole reason for changing the title to overwatch 2 pve story. stopped paying attention to why people enjoy the game on the pvp end and pve elements aka stopped focusing on the characters we love made pvp competitive unplayable with match making, introduced new bugs all we got from overwatch 2 was a very small update to the graphics and a really horribly overpriced monetization system like why did we get no content updates in overwatch 1 for? why did we wait at all for overwatch 2?"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"took away the only thing that would make it better than ow1, now it's clear it is just a cashgrab. before, you could earn cosmetics and it was fun. everyone loved grinding for free loot boxes, and if it wasn't fast enough then you could spend some money and get them. now, you have to either pay for a 80 tier battle pass that is littered with crappy rewards and maybe 8 skins if you're lucky, or you can spend 20 per skin! they promised so much for this version and yet they knew over a year ago it wouldn't work, so they strung people along and built hype only to rip it away. terrible company, terrible game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,blizzard just scammed people with pve content. i've never seen a company do that before.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,nice pve. thx blizzard. 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"the only reason this game was tolerable was bc of the pve, and now we are left with a meh game with worst content starwatch if you get any. rip overwatch, died with the announcement of overwatch 2"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"the game canceled the basis of the game  pve. without it, it's just a money grab."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"when in 2019 you said that you needed resources on pve and there would be no new content for ow1, i supported you when you added a battle pass and a stupid rating system, hiding understandable numbers, i was with you when everyone scolded ow2 for the lack of changes, i rejoiced at 5v5 and believed in you when every update brings a bunch of bugs, i was on your side when you blocked the possibility of buying in my country, i moved now that you have canceled the promised in 2019 pve mode with a skill system...  you"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,so basically the pve got cancelled. ow2 was created in order to bring a pve side next to the pvp. now they decided to just cancel what we'be been waiting for since 2019. we got no content on ow1 for 2 years cuz the dev team was focusing on pve. now 4years of wait was for nothing. it was just all fake promisises. people who said that ow2 was ow1.5 were wrong. it's litterly ow1 or actially even ow0.5. this game is less polished than ow1. more bugs. not balanced. competitive games are a joke. and now the pve is litterly archive missions we used to get on ow1 but instead of having it for free it will be probably locked behind a battlepass. activison blizzard is more and more disapointing. i'm stopping to play the game for now. valorant is a good alternative.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"how are you going to have the audacity to reveal overwatch 2 as having a pve campaign, advertise this game mode for years, delay the release of pve so you can rush the game to come out as a beta early access, ignore and drip feed players information before and after launch, only to find out through some youtube stream and social media that the only thing that's even keeping me around this game is now officially cancelled!? i am thankful to not have spent as much money as other players to consider myself attached to this awful company known as activision blizzard. good luck getting me or any other players to continue buy these battle passes or overpriced skins. i am done with this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"i tried reviewing this at release but the website wouldn't let me. this game is an egregious violation of consumer rights. you paid 60 for the original overwatch and all that it entailed. all the content they added after was a bonus and done on their part. they took every skin that users paid for already and placed behind a paywall upwards of 20. in all if you were to buy every cosmetic in the game it would run you thousands of dollars. worse, the biggest selling point of them turning overwatch into overwatch 2 was the eventual release of a pve mode which is what players wanted. it has now been announced that was scrapped. they took a several year old game rereleasing it in order to milk customers of cash."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"honestly, giving this game a score higher than 2 is being generous. how the hell have we ended up in a place in which it is acceptable to call this creation a sequel to the game we used to know as overwatch?! we used to wait for sequels to tell a new chapter of a storyline, but this? hahahaha it's a joke. not to mention the greediness of it's creators. i have really no idea how have they done this but the game feels like a downgrade, a ripoff, perhaps even a new low on the market. if you haven't tried overwatch back in the day, and you're thinking of playing overwatch 2, because hey, it's free, why not give it a shot, don't bother, it's atrociously bad, and you certainly won't get the fun overwatch used to deliver. all i can say to these poor souls really is sorry mate, it's gone. and you know what's the worst of it? even if you manage to accept that the game has loads of microtransactions and other negatively affecting whatnots like toxicity or the glitches, you still won't get the fun you were looking for! the characters locked behind paywalls will make sure of that. that's perhaps the worst change overwatch 2 implemented. edit 16.05.2023 this has to be a  joke, honestly! how did we even get here, blizzard?! how did we go from such a good game to the absolute worst the gaming scene has ever witnessed?! the first sentence in my comment is obsolete now, this game doesn't even deserve a two, this game deserves a 0, and there's absolutely nothing that could change that now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,stop! it's already dead
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"the entire reason this sequel exists, cancelled. how embarrassing for everyone involved. what did they kill ow1 for? a  battlepass? 5v5? what a joke."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"rip pve the only hope for the game now is dead wit htthis words i will delte my blizzard account, and wat hurt the moste is that i was such a big fan of the this game and now its just dead i have more then 5000 hours in thes game i mean with overwatch 1"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"the game was absolutely destroyed by the developers, who now cancelled pve. ot seems to me that blizzard do nothing to make this game better. only worse"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"they canceled pve, rip overwatch this game is now more dead than zombie!!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,they killed pve the only thing that would've been worth to call overwatch 2
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-16,"taking away a game i paid full price for and replacing it with a worse version of the game with pay2win microtransactions heroes? yeah, no thank you blizzard."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-15,"nerf genji already. why is that character dominating the game since launch? since ow2 the game is just dead. even an unrated queue is 23 minutes. the new characters are very unpolished and unbalanced. they are either overpowered like kiriko, or garbage like lifeweaver. and who the hell came up with this name? make them say it 10 times in a row and if they fail  fire them. only good thing are the skins which are mostly high tier, never spending a dime in blizzard games. i hope microsoft does something with this garbage company."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-15,this game is just overwatch 2 but it's free to play and with a lot of micro transactions that are the same price as the original overwatch game cost so the developers are just trying to get money out of the players.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-13,"desproposito de juego, una saga que da patadas de ahogado para seguir viviendo, desastre, nada de innovacion, nada nuevo mas que cosas malas, terrible."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-13,"it's freetoplay and accessible to everyone, but it's already in the same state as the end of ow1. they will never publish realtime connection numbers, as they have always done, nor will they improve disparate matchmaking to hide overpopulation. dead game. the user score shows it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-13,"they actually made this game semipay to win. the new heroes are in the battle pass at level 45. that's at least one month of game play if not more. or you pay 10 bucks and unlock the hero right away. other multiplayer titles like league of legends or valorant aren't this greedy but greedy in other ways. it's the usual blizzard thing one step forwards, five steps backwards. also, the match making is absolute horrible. i really miss overwatch 1."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-09,this game blows even harder than the first game. .
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-08,"in the first days i was thinking that game is pretty good. but after playing for a half year  i see that game is so bad and doesn't have any normal updates after overwatch 1. the battlepass system is so bad, why do we need it?"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-07,"endless applying update than i've been suspended. thank you, your game is bullst"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-05-03,the level of toxicity and tilt in this game is absolutely mind blowing and for a good reason. 80 from all matches are uneven to one side or another .it either your team cant even leave spawn or enemy team barely can do anything. playing this game is traumatic experience because of completely broken uneven matchmaking most of the time. ranking system is unrewarding. you stay forever in same low level rank.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-24,"the balancing of this game is horrible. blizzard tries to fix it by nerfing and buffing characters, but it never works. the game has banned me for the entire season because my game crashed while loading into a competitive match. the skins are overpriced, and the game is just toxic"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-23,"i was a huge fan of the first overwatch when the game director was jeff kaplan. the game had its own taste and was a brilliant fps that taught me a lot in game design. but new chapter is not a new chapter. its just a try to sell the same game in new box. more than that, overwatch 2 lost its own style in design and level design became less professional and less organized. but the worst thing in the direction of overwatch is leftwing agenda. you can see everywhere. beginning from new characters and last with removed compete statistic in the end of the match  developers removed statistic and leaderboard in competitive game.... it was a bad decision, i think. my friends are not going to buy blizzard games due to this agenda."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-19,"between the pay to win, having absolutely nothing to work towards without buying the battle pass, smurfs, and cheaters this game is a total waste of time. this game should have been a mobile game. absolute garbage"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-17,"worst team balance, toxic community, cheaters, bad level design for new maps."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-17,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-17,"i didn't purchase this game it's free to play anyway, but i did purchase the original overwatch. the original overwatch does not exist anymore, and has been replaced with this  inferior  version. rather than making a new game, blizzard has decided replace a game with a lesser version. again. they did this once before with war craft iii reforged actually replacing the original war craft iii meaning that war craft iii was patched to the reforged engine, including stripping it of several features it used to have, whether you bought reforged or not. this is a business practice that needs to be stopped. this is, effectively, a long con baitandswitch, having people who buy one game and then several years down the line you just wipe that game out and replace it with one that's missing features and content. this forces people into the new version, even if the older version is better. on top of this, activisionblizzard are now violating sales laws in certain countries with their store, the same technique that bethesda was busted for doing in fallout 76. and when you are starting to emulate that game, you know you're in trouble."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-15,im sad that they remove lootboxes cause i had almost unlocked almost everything in overwatch one so i was a bit sad but whatever im just happy that the game i love playing now has frequent updates and is more balance from the first game
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-15,"this game is honestly really fun but the matchmaking is so awful it completely ruins it. every update they claim they fix the matchmaking but then you actually go into the games and see how awful it is. 80 of the games i play are completely one sided on competitive, and if one of your teammates are really underperforming you are essentially guaranteed to lose since this game is extremely teambased. i cant recommend at all unless you have a ton of friends to play with or are fine with bad matchmaking."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-15,"this game is a broken mess and it can't be salvaged. every new patch released, claiming to solve problems only creates others. artificially boosting and tanking player's ranks, poor matchmaking, allowing for rank disparities that are not possible to queue with if within the same party, and then after all of that, servers are still inconsistent and players often lag out or are disconnected without warning. these are only the technical problems. in game, characters that are blatantly over powered are not balanced properly and when the mid season patch rolls around to change the meta again, these characters are often untouched with others receiving little needed nerfs to their kits, further limiting the pool of heroes able to be viably chosen. games are almost never close, they are complete steamrolls due to the poor matchmaking and often players will queue up and be thrown into a game high above their elo that they have absolutely no chance of participating in, let alone winning. in a masters and diamond lobby, there are many times where i've seen gold and platinum players, where as if i were to attempt to queue with a friend of that rank, the rank disparity would be too wide to be able to queue for a ranked game. it shouldn't be possible for this to happen but it does fairly often and it has not been fixed even in the season 4 patch. every game feels like a gamble, and with little solo carry potential, given the team based nature of the game, it is almost impossible to climb in solo queue without immense luck. after ending season 2 at the diamond 2 rank, ranking up to that division the night before the new season, i logged on the next day to see my rank at gold 3. i spent the majority of the season solo queuing, as friends accounts were not dropped as low as mine, despite similar games played and consistency in play. after climbing to grandmaster 4 during season 3 and ending in masters, i questioned what the reason was for my rank being lowered in the first place. there is no answer though, there never is from blizzard, they focus their efforts on cosmetics, that were formerly free but now are behind a paywall, as well as new maps for you to lose your mental on. the core problems with the game are never addressed. a patch will release boasting a fairly decent change, only to absolutely break another part of the game without even attempting to change that system. a hero may not be working correctly, so a small tweak is made to change it to the way it was intended, but in the meantime, blizzard forgot to mention that now you will be playing on higher ping servers for some reason and you can barely matchmake in your region."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-13,"overwatch 2 is the same damn game but worse. i cannot believe they went the freetoplay route when really it is just a trap for micro transactions. the only time it is decent fun is when you play with friends but if your like me and do not have any, it is awful and boring."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-09,"how do people still play this. in the first overwatch, it was the best, with no battle pass, still pretty good graphics, and pretty good balancing. now i can only get 15 fps, and i would used to get like 30  60. and then they added a battle pass that have new characters, or you have to win a certain amount of games to do it. and i cant even play a game without getting kicked out of inactivity. if they just took what made the first overwatch good, and improve those better, it would be way better. but practically the only thing that changed is now they have basically everything paid. there is basically no reason to play this game unless you don't want to have fun at all."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-03,they made ow into a cash grab. there is no reason to lock hero's behind a battle pass. then also charge 20 for a skin that's been in the gam since day 1. they got rid of in my opinion the best loot box system. they also ruined competitive. makes me sad thinking how good this game could of been
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-04-01,"in the beginning absurd, game breaking que times upon initial release routine disconnects which prevent normal games for either team a surprising amount of bugs which interfere with normal gameplay after the first few days hey, i like a lot of these changes my matches are somewhat balanced seems to be working well last weekend, monday, tuesday almost all of my heroes get locked for a night i have to deal with que times again? every match is, once again like in overwatch 1, roll or be rolled, stomp or get stomped you know, i don't even care that much about the battlepassstore even though it is atrocious and far worse than the old lootbox system, but i do care about being able to play a well matched game without bugs or disconnect issues. ow2 has already become ow1 in regards to this unacceptable circumstance. and the teammates you get these days, wow. i had a tank on my team last night in a competitive game who constantly bemoaned my inability to heal them, yet i had the most heals in the whole game from beginning to end. i said to them during the match, press tab and look at the scoreboard. they obviously never did because they made the same complaint to the match chat at the end of the game. the enemy healers and my fellow support had about 7k healing each. i had 14k heals. so you can do literally twice the amount of healing as every other player in the game, lose, and still have your team's tank pin the failure on you. what more can you do in that circumstance? it is impossible to make your tank and other teammates not kill themselves by exposing themselves to multiple 5v1 scenarios which is impossible to outheal, of course. you can't make them kill the enemy or understand basic mechanics of the game like getting on the objective or appropriately using the map to avoid damage. your teammates may very well not understand how their hero, their teammates heroes, or their enemy heroes function or how they should be countered. the game becomes broken, but you're the one getting blamed for the loss despite doing statistically more than anyone else in your role. overwatch 2 is a frustrating group project without satisfying rewards. sadly, i don't think i will even give ow2 a second shot after all of these issues. i say sadly because i really do appreciate and enjoy the idea of overwatch. unfortunately, the reality of overwatch is a frustrating mess with some of the dumbest, most hateful people you will encounter on this planet."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-30,"a good core shining through a pile of bad design decisions overwatch 2 cannot be explained without its predecessor. overwatch 1 was one of the very best multiplayer experiences in terms of accessibility and clear design choices. the multiplayer landscape is littered with games, designed for young players, eagerly waiting to spend countless hours to sharpen their skills. overwatch 1, led by jeff kaplan, achieved to combine a more mature player base with a high enough skill ceiling for younger players. it did so by following two clear design principles fun over balance and easy to learn, hard to master. the core of this game was so good, that even now, where none of these principles are kept, it can only leave scars at it, no matter how hard the developers try to destroy it. they introduce tanks, which have unclear abilities and no tankresembling physique. they implement duplicates of existing heroes and new ones, which skill gap is so huge, that you cant expect success with less than 10 hours of practice. and these decisions or scars start to add up, blurring the clear vision of a once great game, leaving only a feeling of hollowness and anger against the incompetence of the new staff. adding to this, is the utter ridiculous new monetization system, charging players 26 for one skin for one of the 36 heroes. even the trostpreise german for consolation prizes reach price tags of 10, consisting of worthless profile pictures, sprays and victory poses. one might ask if there are unlockables, well, if you mean with money, then yes, there are unlockables. last but not least, the wokeness of this game must be addressed. due to the fact, that blizzard employees cant keep their hands off of women, proven by countless controversies, the executives are now trying to paint over their dark past by sending mendacious letters of excuse. these letters consist of posing only black heroes on the cover, cutting away from the asian esport players in their trailers, renaming existing heroes and pushing an allfemale agenda and many more ridiculously small steps. i always liked overwatch for pushing boundaries, but with this, they are not brave, but instead playing it safe to appeal to a modern audience. since blizzard tries to be responsible for the top 5 worst rated games on metacritic, i must congratulate it to be one step closer to its, now very achievable, goal."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-27,"game is amazing, only small issue is prices, prices prices and prices, in game microtransaction cost a lot, 25 for 3 yeas old skin doesnt sound fair, recoloring skin and giving it cost 20 alwo doesn't sound"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-25,monetization  ass and has no reason to be this bad. compare it with league of legends monetization that is also free and you get a  ton more free loot in that game and you'll see the problem especially since lol is way more profitable than ow2

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-20,from really good game to money making garbage. blizzard just continues to  all of your money with the lowest effort possible.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-19,what is 2 stand for in the title? it is the same game. old blizzard made game sequels with huge improvements on what was before
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-18,this game is just full of ups and downs from the moment it got released and the horrible monetization that made ppl want the loot boxes back really didn't help the games reputation
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-17,servers are terrible. player base is even worse. you want to know why ? because they have a motive. their motive is because the whole matching and ranking system is messed up. you can be the lowest rank and still can encounter players that by rank would normally be at least platinum or diamond that have played the game for at least 200 hours and know the game and the strategies far more better than a player who just started playing and has the lowest rank. the mechanics of this game are the only ones that are decent. they are even good. and you can notice that a handful of people worked a lot to make this game so good. but the ranking system is ruining all the work and effort that those people put in.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-17,removed the second tank option overwatch 2? it's a glorified overwatch 1 season 2 if anything and a season that ruins the funniest aspects of the game. such a bloody shame and why did it take them so long if graphics and engine are the same? so confused.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-16,"the number 2 in the title is a joke, it's rather a small patch to overwatch removing more stuff than it adds. the main new features are long login times, getting kicked out of games and ending up with suspension for leaving the game, and even worse hit registration than in the original overwatch. changes made to competitive mode make it much worse, many characters designed for 6v6 do not work in 5v5. not to mention the most fragile player base and overzealous game developer, which leads to seasonlong bans just because you complain on chat about bad character picks of other players or about lousy performance. good players can't interact with bad players who report verbal abuse, so they leave the game. at the same time trolls, abusive players, and such just get new accounts, it's free after all! and the last thing is matchmaking. player base is by now very small and dwindling, so to avoid long ques game throws people of ridiculously different levels into the same game. there are no close games, good games. it's always a onesided roflstomp where one team annihilates another. if you think it's worth giving a shot to relive the magic of the first overwatch, do yourself a favour and stay away. at least you will keep fond memories of the overwatch from 7 years ago"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-15,"this is disappointingly underwhelming for a sequel. it's literally overwatch 1 with a couple of new maps. it feels more like an update rather than a new game, and they didn't even release a single player version which was advertised as overwatch 2's big upgrade over its predecessor. not only that, but overwatch 1 was taken down and skins locked, so all of the great content you spent time getting in the first game has to be rebought. this is such a cash grab it is ridiculous. don't play if you want to discourage this kind of predatory behavior that doesn't reward loyalty to players and encourages you to gamble with loot crates."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-14,"this game is terrible, do not recommend in its current state. gameplay is super stale, the devs don't seem to really care about the game, and the community is even worse. feels like a huge cash grab especially considering how expensive cosmetics are. i know we complained about lack of content towards the end of ow1 but that doesn't mean come out with a regurgitated game that has broken characters that don't get nerfed for centuries when they couldve just done a midpatch update to nerf them. instead they wait until the game is in a terrible state and as a last ditch effort try to balance things. they have neglected their promised pve mode, and have given like 0 information about it. also making the pve mode and paid dlc which is just tragic considering ow1 players were forced to switch to ow2 and didnt really get compensation for it other than oh you get to keep your things that youve earned!! save your mental and go play something more enjoyable. id rather play league than this game and thats saying something."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-03-02,"the r34 is good, aynthing else is mostly a joke. overwatch on it's on is not a bad game, however the overwatch 2 rerelease adds little to nothing to the game besides shutting down it's old servers in favor of making a battlepass simulator with the good old exploitative and preditory monetization system."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-28,"the game itself is fun. but this game is also the perfect example of how blizzard ruins its great ips. greedy overpriced battle pass which provides not many new contents. locked new heroes in the battle pass either u pay for it or grind to around 50 levels. matchmaking is the worst i've ever seen. the rank u got after playing comp is not your real rank, there is a hidden mmr that they use to match u with ur opponents. which means u might get lower rank than what the hidden mmr show. there is not transparency of which rank u are. they sacrifice the gameplay experience with the queue time so that you don't need to wait too long but they just messed up the balancing between these 2. the community is toxic."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-27,"1. the server is always broken. 2. compared to overwatch 1, everywhere has not developed. 3. it has a billing structure that looks like a nexon. 4. the incredibly slow bellance adjustment and the release of the hero too slow for riot. 5. increasing number of cheat users due to freeing. 6. unable to determine cheat user due to profile nondisclosure function. ironically, a system that shows the amount of damage and heal 7. a league that has practically been abandoned. this is not a game. just trash"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-26,i dont really care about the monetization but it wasnt cool to be forced from ow1 to ow2. i also miss some old maps.  only one tank  better graphics  better ui  new heroes and skins  worse net code  worse latency  bad matchmaking i know you cant win every time but you shouldnt be losing match after match  bad tanks there shouldnt be fast tanks  game is faster hope the game will get better in the future and give players fair games.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-24,"this new game was really a disappointment... ow1 players  people who bought ow1 got almost no compensation for being forced to migrate to ow2,they just kept the things they already had in ow1, which was nothing more than the company's obligation to keep those goods, and they gained some characters and some cosmetics which in my opinion are very few and bad.  ow1 players did not earn any compensation for the years they had without any new content for the game.  although a player's level is not a very important thing, it is still a player's achievement and taking that away from someone is quite annoying...  almost all the skins that are possible to obtain during the new events are skins that had already been released for a while, so players who already own the skin do not gain anything from the event. battle pass  battle pass is nonrenewable you cannot, through the battle pass, earn a way to buy the next battle pass  the battle pass appears to have a lot of rewards, but in reality, most of the rewards are just bad, like sprays, weapon accessories, etc.  even those rewards that are considered good have problems, as players who play primarily support and don't play the other two roles assuming the battle pass has equal number of rewards for both three roles, only 13 of those rewards will be considered good for that player, while 23 of the rewards will be from roles that the player doesn't even play.  the new cosmetics like the weapon charms seem like they were just created to make more money from the game, with no concern as to whether this type of cosmetic fits the type of game ow really is, for example they literally stuck a pendant inside sigma's hand...  summing up with everything mentioned above, although i consider the price acceptable, the fact that most of the rewards are just junk like icons, sprays, charms, souvenirs, and maybe you could also consider the name cards and voice lines , and even the ones that are considered good are often for characters you don't even play with. ps and it is also nonrenewable .. cost benefit  the price of skins is extremely high, also taking into account that if you buy a skin for one character, a different character cannot use it. f2p friendly  the rewards for those who don't spend money in the game are pretty bad, even in events... in the 2022 halloween event, f2p players only received charms, sprays, voice lines and battle pass xp as rewards, basically just useless garbage, making it not even worth trying to collect the rewards or even playing the event more than once or twice to try it out, or even, after collecting the rewards, there was no reason to continue playing the event.  players, per week, can earn up to sixty ingame coins after completing up to eleven specific, boring and annoying challenges i'm sorry, but i don't want to have to win seven games in a row as all roles and have to play roles that i hate... . with these coins you can buy different cosmetics, the problem is that they are only sixty coins a week and the cosmetics are very expensive.  bearing in mind that epic skins cost 1000 ingame coins and the legendary ones cost 1900 ingame coins. doing the math, it would take you 4 months and a week to buy just one epic skinbp and it would take almost 8 months to buy just one legendary skin... competitive  the ranking system is a bit confusing and frustrating for example, sometimes when my games are going very well and when it comes time to receive my new rank, i remain in exactly the same rank, putting all my effort directly into to the f garbage.... the good things that came with this new game...  it seems that there are less and less cheaters in the game, and when one appears, we are informed that the player has received his punishment at least the warnings about the ban are faster than in ow1.  the game is still fun when played with friends ps almost all games are fun when played with friends, so i don't know if that's really a quality to mention about this game....  new characters for the game ps which could also have been released in ow1 if it continued to receive new content.  only 1 tank per team made the game more fun and now we don't have to deal with 2 super hard targets and their infinite barriers same thing for 2cp"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-11,"an insult to gamers everywhere. they took a game, changed almost nothing except blatantly copied the fortnite model. it's f2p, but now skins and battle passes dominate the game in an attempt to  as money money from teenagers as they can. in the process, the removed the soul of the game and most of its signature features. the game is unbalanced garbage, and the critics who were paid to write a positive review should be as ashamed of themselves as the paid streamers paid to boost this dumpster fire . i've never seen a player base so unhappy before. this is everything wrong with gaming. money over fun. gimmicks over balance. empty shell of what was once my favorite game. all that's left is to let it die a merciful death. please, just put it out of its misery. any game other than this is a better use of your time."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-11,"the concept of this game is fantastic and unique in a market over saturated with poor fps games. however the very core of this game is based around a matchmaking system that makes the game almost unplayable if you want to have any sort of fun. the matchmaking system is so complex with no transparency that blizzard fail to address. most of the fans are sick of the line the matchmaking system is working as intended  well yeah perhaps it is in your heads, but when 90 of your player base is actually experiencing a terrible game play experience then there's something wrong."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-10,"kept practically the same as the first game, with the addition of lighting on some maps changing and some new heroes. a lot have said it, and i'll say it again, this game is a glorified update thats pushing to get a few bucks out of the players, and the balancing is awful, roadhog still dominates, doomfist being moved to tank does not help anything. not to mention the last few event modes have been awfully balanced, battle for olympus being a most obvious example. at the end of the day, the games free now, so bonus points... i guess..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-08,"as some one who has played overwatch since the start, i am so disappointed in how they turned into such a skum filled company. ow 2 is nothing more then a scam trying to steal as much money as they can before it goes down. like the season 3 bp where if you didn't read the notes outside of the game you wouldn't know that the premium credits are actually retextured legacy credits that are worthless. i hope they learn to be less skum and less greedy, till then i am uninstalling."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-06,"halfway acceptable game 410 if it wasn't for the fact that it a much, much worse version of the original overwatch. they spend years to make the game worse in virtually every aspect from matchmaking to balance. the fact that the game is free2play, paired with blizzards weak anticheat system means the game is full of cheaters, the matchmaking is bad, you can have gm and bronze in the same arcade and unranked matches and previous master with current bronze even in ranked as rank decay between seasons is unreasonably high. ow2 is all about tanks, so arcade games and open queue will result in the team picking more tanks to virtually always win. 34 tanks with 12 healers is the meta. it's terrible game design and wasn't addressed in 4 months. stay away from this monstrosity."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-02-01,"i want to give this game a higher ranking, i compete with my college's esports team and thoroughly enjoy playing the game, but i feel it's from nostalgia of the previous entry. after a couple of months being released, they have fixed a bunch of issues that were brought up from release, although i do agree that those issues should not have existed. the balance changes are still terrible, they seem to look at stats rather than fan feedback and haven't learned so from ow1. however, they have been updating the fanbase more frequently, and with season 3 coming up, seem to be making a turn for the better. i give it a 7 because i still thoroughly enjoying playing the game, while understanding that there are still a bunch of issues that come with the game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-31,"my personal bias is that i don't like overwatch. overwatch 2 is just worse, and made me wish i hadn't sunk in any time into. the only new thing is the characters locked behind grinding a battle pass, and skins that aren't even phenomenal being overpriced. everything is behind a micro transaction, it's an actual cash grab. there's absolutely nothing special about skins you buy in the shop, if anything i think the ow1 skins had more personality than the skins now. great example kiriko's witch skin hardly has anything notable, but mercy's witch skin has different voice lines according to what you're doing. does blizzard not pay the va's enough to get any dialogue out? i swear their budgeting goes into the cinematic and not improving the game. i regret those 4000 hours i wasted. i could've gotten married, had kids, and died happy not knowing overwatch existed. now i'm burdened with the knowledge that there's a sequel."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-30,overwatch 2 is basically overwatch with one new character and one battle pass character. i give it 0 points because of their current battle pass system to get people to spend money on the game. battle pass is yet another way to steal money and i can not give anything other than 0 for that. you would be better off spending your money on slot machines make sure they are not owned by konami...

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-26,"wow..... blizzard is something. i have never written a review for any game before, but im honestly just so disgusted by this game that i have to. this game infinitely worse that ow1 on its own, loved features are gone, physics are so much worse, most of the characters are now unbalanced or broken which will take years to fix, old maps are shuntted to the side to make way for their horrid new counterparts, they have actually removed more content from the original game than they have actually added  straight up less content. this really is just a lesser reskinned version of ow1. veterans of blizzards antics will know they are very good at doing this and getting away with it. forced to play what feels like a game still in early beta, when we paid for a perfectly fine version just to have it deleted. they knew this game would be killed off if they didnt kill off ow1 servers first. this game is honestly just a a glorified cash grab disguised as a game. requiring people to dump tens of thousands of dollars into the game to acquire skins that everyone got for free in ow1. i never minded the loot box system, because it was never shoved in our faces and were never forced to buy them for mid tier skins. i played 1400 hours of ow1, and loved it. vast majority of my friends, vets of the game like myself, refuse to play this downgraded replacement. i really gave this game a solid go just to try and prove that there was anything good about this game to keep me playing, and so i didnt feel like i wasted all those hours of my life. after 25 hours of trying i can say with certainty that there is nothing. i will not be returning to this game, or any games made by blizzard. they are all the same reskinned games with no attempt to make them better but somehow come out worse than the original with years of feedback to build on. i would never recommend this game to anyone, it's just as soulless as the people who made it."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-16,it costs 5 dollars to buy an emote for 1 character to sit down. to sit down... in a game. for 50 dollars you can make 10 characters sit down. now that's what i call a great value.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-15,"making it f2p was a mistake. calling it a fullfledged sequel is incorrect. we got somewhat refreshed pvp gameplay, but somehow a lot of little details, qol stuff, matchmaking, monetisation, and progression system got worse. optimization also got worse in my experience. i still have fun here and there playing this game with friends, but i can't give this second part a higher score than 310. matchmaking now is very bad, both for qps and competetive. it's a big topic, so if you want to know more  there are a lot of info on that already in the internet. in og overwatch you could get 4 random legendary skins, enough gold to purchase a legendary skin you want, and other items, like sprays, emotions, etc in 8 months worth of play. now you can only get 1 legendary skin and a few minor items across the battlepass, completing challenges. and it doesn't matter if that skin is 6 years old, prices are the same. when a weapon charm in real life costs less than that exact charm in game, when it is more efficient to farm gold in wow to buy items in ow than play ow itself  there should be something wrong in this monetisation policy. recent event is also very lazypoorly done, looks like just to showcase new skins, 20 each. my only hope is that pve content will be worth all these shortcomings we got."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-15,"i mean, it's alright. could be way better, it's the same game with few more characters, new maps and a new gamemode wich i personally don't like it feels like they just named it 2 to attract new players and players who used to play before but didn't do it later. if they focused on the story, and added a story mode or something it could have gone wayyy different. hope they do something with this franchise, because it has great potential, but as always with blizz games, it is probably going nowhere. another thing i don't like is the removal of loot boxes, that was a fair and fun way of getting free stuff in the game, now if you want a cosmetic you're obligated to buy, because doing missions isn't worth it. so, basically overwatch 2 is a medium sized overwatch 1 dlc, but free with micro transactions now. the game itself is good, but it's the same as the first one, i can't rate it higher for much i want to do it. a better title for the game would be overwatch ea fortnite has done real harm to gaming."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-15,"at first, the gameplay changes felt good. 5v5 instead of 6v6, less cc, new game mode and new maps, a bunch of new heroes... then, the battle pass annoyed me. even though i bought the watchpoint pack with extra ow coins, what i got was dismal at best, especially compared to fortnite's battle pass at the time. the store is extremely greedy, and the 2000 coins i had from the pack weren't enough to buy one single legendary skin pack. they have always priced 2200 coins or so... then this new game mode push got boring pretty fast since it's pretty difficult to do a comeback in this mode. as i played the game more and more, it felt more and more like a big patch rather than a sequel. there is no fundamental improvement in the groundwork of the game. like, the ad spam is still a thing, the game still overrelies on healers, old maps have the same layouts, and there is no new gameplay mechanic or a new idea or anything. the game lacks the innovation and content to deserve a 2 at the end of its name."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-14,"overwatch 1 was a good game with a few issues. overwatch 2 improves visuals slightly but all the issues overwatch 1 has are now just make overwatch 2 unplayable. balancing is done by a potato, most of my games have been one team just dominating the other. mystery hero is now just the same 6 hero's 70 of the time and then the other 30 hero's share the rest. this game was obviously made to make the most money out of the chinese market."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-13,"cannot join ranked matches when it has found one. sometimes, it is possible after a restart. if you are unlucky, you get suspended instead. years of development for slightly better graphics has paid off. i cannot recommend the game in this state."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-11,"the game have a lot of heroes to choose from, there is almost no bugs and it has a unique gameplay compared to other shooters. the only thing i hate it's the bad matchmaking."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-09,"games buggy as heck, balance is bad, new systems pointless and unfun also made straight up for chinesse players money"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-08,"overwatch 2 doesn't add anything to the formula, it actually just lessens what overwatch 1 was. any cosmetics of value in 1 now cost 1020, they've removed the ability to earn any skin for free outside of the events which was only added after the horrible response they received during bride of junkenstein. the ranked mode is now an abomination of cuddles and not wanting to hurt people's feelings, blizzard doesn't think that the player base is mature enough to understand their rank, therefore rank is completely hidden from the player, not only is it hidden, the ranked icon you receive during play means absolutely nothing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-07,"disconnects from the competitive game, then gives a ban for quitting the match"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-06,"honestamente este juego es horrible, el matchmaking literal esta demasiado desbalanceado colocando jugadores del top 500 contra jugadores que recien estan empezando a rankear incluso, el hecho de que haya que pagar por todo, incluyendo los nuevos personajes, hace que se desbalanceen todas las rankeds, como main tank no puedo usar al nuevo personaje porque literal tengo que pagar como 30 dolares o jugar casi 2 meses seguidos para conseguirlo, es casi una obligacion usarlo en ranked por todo el buff que le han metido... la verdad este juego no merece ni siquiera haber salido"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-06,"man i was a fool to continue maintaining faith on blizzard. i should have known better this was just another halfass game they pedaled, in order to milk more cash from us consumers. this is not what you call a sequel. it's just more of a rework of the original overwatch, with some new content only being available via microtransactions, and server issues being rampant. this is the final straw i have with blizzard. at this point, i am not going to buy any more products from them, and i suggest everyone to do the same. blizzard is nothing more than a greedy company who only prioritizes on getting easy money from it's fans."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-06,"this game is so bad, it makes me sad. imbalanced, broken mmr, now pay to win by buffing a hero you have to buy get him now instead of playing 45 levels of endless grinding. teammates often act like bots. the free to play system ruined the entire ow1 community."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-05,"boy i was wrong the first time. when i wrote first review i was very critical of this game. but also expected for it to get better. after all bad launches are pretty much standard of industry now. but my 210 was clearly overly optimistic. after playing this game every day for past 3 months, i can definitively say that things actually got worse. a lot worse. gameplay itself mostly came over from ov1 and so its ok. balancing is trash. they have changed a lot of mechanics from original game, but it was clearly done by people that had very loose understanding of what they were doing. as almost every aspect of the game it is a downgrade. laggers are bane of this game and due to idiotic manner engine is coded, can tank a nuke in their face, smile and keep on going. ov1 had same problem. good to see that nothing has changed. cheaters, due to it f2p model, are in abundance. while all those pros mostly congregate in competitive, there is at least one in every secondthird game in unranked as well. matchmaking, as of 2 patches ago, was completely ruined in unranked. in 6 out of 7 games one team will be completely steamrolling another. its not just bad, its atrocious. mission system is horrible. for one, half of them require winning games. what happened with just playing!? regardless of winning or losing. second, there are several that are just stupid, like waving at healer. with them not working most of the time or completing without any waving. seriously, what kind of moron came up with this crap?!?! and third is diversification of weekly missions, forcing players, if they want to collect what little currency game generously gives players, to play as every role. you cant complete all the mission by playing as just one role. in fact one of weekly missions specifically requires player to win 3 games as each role. i am support main, with some tanking on occasion. and i have no interest in playing dps role. why to duck to force me not to just ruin my own games, forcing to play as dps, but for other people on my team, as i  as dps. losing game after game, to get those stupid  3 wins as each role. they could have made hybrid missions, like mitigate or heal damage and make missions simply requiring playing, not stressing out about winning and lose game after game. rewards for weeklies are peanuts. you can make max 60 coins a week. one epic skin costs 1900 coins. so you need to grind 11 poorly balanced missions every week for 8 months to be able to buy just one skin. and while for daily missions you need to complete just 3 out of 6 available, to max out rewards, there is just 11 weekly missions in total, so you cant pick and choose what fits you best. overall balancing in this section is from wall to wall, from normal to complete trash and stupidity. events are made is same manner as normal missions and they are all pretty much the same. and of course of same low quality. like current battle for olympus event. top reward is a skin, a nice one, for mercy, that id very much like to get as i am support main. and then you look at requirements... for one this is a ffa event. in a game that is build around idea of teamplay, you have ducking ffa event. not several events, where players can pick and chose what fits them most, no, one option. are you for ducking serious!?!?! to get skin i need to complete 6 other missions. rest of rewards are trash anyway. some exp, some voice linesthat nobody cares about, some titlesthat nobody cares about. 2 missions are easy and can be completed in just onetwo games, by simply playing. but rest... duck me... 300 kills as one of the champions will complete one missionand you need 6 in total for skin. three hundred ducking kills. for each champion. of course alternative is so much better. only 25  only during ults. alternatively player can win 10 ffas. we are talking a full time job to win this skin. those imbeciles at blizzard are out of their ducking minds. this is what you get when you hire based on diversity, rather than merit. you can get two missions by collecting power ups, another one by winning 10 gamesgood luck with that, considering that it is a complete chaos there and score 900 kills between three different champions, playing same map and mode again and again and again, for one ducking skin! of course i could put 20 euros into this game and buy said skin. but i will not, on principle, support game that mistreats it players in such blatant manner. so i take back my 210 and give it 010 now. nothing in ov2 is even remotely good, aside of parts that were taken from ov1, that are passable."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-04,"the gameplay is a improvement, but pve is delayed the battlepass is a mess i hate how im thinking about the stupid battlepass and seeing if im going to max it out or not, also anything everything thinks about is the battlepass, you get jack for playing the game exp wise, so if people realize oh im going to lose this match and it wont help with the challenges they just leave. there is like 6 leavers each match. you have to que competitive just to get a normal match also the balancing is still slow, they straight up removed rank info and are not transparent about deving like they promised"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-04,"way too many quick play matches with incomplete teams. in some matches it's e.g. 5v4 from start to end. it wasn't that bad in ow1. i was ok with the lootboxes from ow1, now i ignore the shop system completely  just nope!"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-03,it makes me sad to see overwatch 2 being one of these typ of battle pass games i always despised. back then ow1 had its own special things. now all gone for the money. guys dont invest in ow2. it's not worth it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-02,"made the game worse in so many ways. this company's greed knows no bounds. adding heroes to a lengthy battlepass, removing pretty much all ability to earn cosmetics for free, ruining balance, removing many beloved features, resetting competitive ranks, i could go on."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-01,"the balance team needs to be fired and replaced with a drunk monkey. genji was a high tier hero who had been bad for 2 years. he was not broken, just finally good. so they gutted him and buffed his counters. they cannot let genji ever be good because support players can't be expected to learn matchups. a drunk monkey could probably balance the game better than the current balance team."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2023-01-01,"honestly the worst game ever. a bunch of bugs, problems, but what can i say. the developers can't even make a normal patch. they buff those who really don't need it. and who really needs a buff, they can't make her strong. yes, yes, her name is junker queen, a buff that did not give her anything. she is still a weak tank. lifesteal  pathetic 19 hp. shout  200 hp for 5 seconds, and then a cooldown for 14 seconds. rampage only reduced the cooldown by 10, and did that give her any advantage? kiriko for example cancels antiheal. what is special about the queen? nothing. she's a terrible tank, the devs don't want to buff her."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-31,"coming from overwatch1 i played overwatch 2 for season 1 and quit immeditately after. it feels like the game has been stripped off it's elements which made it a great game from the beginning e.g. ranking system, loot boxes, 6 vs 6 and, and and. instead, a useless and absolutely wiorthless battle pass has been introduiced of which items 99 have no use. not worth my time, sorry."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-31,"ruined my favourite game. used to log in for the joy of medals, voting on best players, the on fire symbol, the ques now qtf are they about with 9min for a support. the fact mh isn't in arcade its unranked.... the fact blizz called it overwatch 2.... come on its a lame xpac. oh the levels they removed as in portrait levels. i was just in gold heading up. now its gone, sad very sad. i would in and enjoy playing to earn loot boxes for my kids to open. they would be excited on a epic or legendary skin. i would log in daily for at least 2hrs if i could, now i am struggling to be bothered even logging in and i hardly do. just enough to get the free battle pass stuff done. anyways sad blizz ruined my favourite game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-30,"it's absolutely a downgrade from ow1. the inflated prices for the skins and battle pass are one part, however the gameplay changes and continuing balancing issues are the real kicker. ow1 was build around the concept of counter play, it's the reason hero switching mid game exists. with ow2 they official said goodby to counter play  probably because it's a really bad look to lock game changers like new characters behind a pay wall if it interfers with the basic game mechanics. it is anyway no good look tbh. issue is just that counterplay is absolutely deep seated in the game, the balancing, the hero designs. blizzard changed much around to try and get rid of it, but getting rid of a core gameplay aspect is difficult without stripping a game of it's identity. the change to 5v5 might distract from that, but that change also worsened the balancing issues and it's nowhere as noticable as with the new heroes they play actually very well in 5v5. just most of the original heroes don't. they were created to fill niches, to be used to counter other characters, to work in the framework of 6v6 and it's noticable. the game is in permanent need of patches and reworks and that much more as it was during ow1 times. the slow patch cycles are painful by now, and won't sustain the game for long. in the end ow2 is a halfbaked sequel in more than one sense it lacks the pve mode used as original drawing point, it needs to balance the need to stay just enough like ow1 while it actually wants to be something completely different and while doing so becomes a mess that slowly breaks apart most noticable with the decline in support players, a role that should have gotten a huge rework the moment the change to one tank was decided. the developers should better work fast to get the balancing issues, the stale battlepass, the bugs, the matchmaking, the imbalance between roles and the removal of actual nice game features like the end of game cards under control. maybe a completely different game instead of a sequel might have worked better as it wouldn't have come with as much baggage."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-29,"i've played ow since it's release and gave ow2 a bit of time to grow on me but i can't stand it anymore. they removed so many rewarding elements. the game feels like it gives you so little time to react to how much worse this game is by cutting down the time to even talk to other players after every game and even removing general chat. getting rid of after game cards and being on fire removes so much. push maps are designed to make games as long as possible, making it worse than 2cp ever was. endorsement levels are at an all time low because you don't see cards highlighting how well someone was doing compared to everyone else. i don't even want to get into how bad the loot box and battle pass system is. 5v5 wouldve been great if they actually made tanks feel like tanks, instead of just further incentivizing tanks to act like dps with more hp and call it making space instead of being the only defensive specialists the game has. the game has become who can kill the supports the fastest."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-28,"very unrewarding game. unlike overwatch 1, you don't get loot boxes from just playing where you can get the skins you want. every new hero is locked behind a battle pass where you either pay 10 to play it immediately or grind for weeks to play it. to get a legendary skin, you have to grind for a minimum of 8 months as you get 60 coins for the 3 weekly missions. in short, there's no incentive to play overwatch 2, and as it stands, it's a boring game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-27,"this is not a new game! this is a patch that ruined de original game. yes it became a freetoplay, and, in my opinion, that ruined everything. there is no more grinding for skins well unless you are willing to spend 5 years playing for 1 skin the only way to get them is paying 20 bucks a piece. they force you to go through their tedious battle pass to unlock new characters at lvl 45 unless you pay this game is a cashgrab."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-26,the game is a huge downgrade from the original. as someone who paid of the first game a game that now doesn't exist anymore i don't like that if i want to play on a fair playing field i need to hope my team mates have forked out money for the latestmost broken heroes.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-25,"this game has the potential to be insanely fun and competitive. however, the developers decided that in order to balance the matchmaking system they will put you in lobbies with players nowhere near your skill bracket to force you into a win or loss based on whatever arbitrary system they use to decide what the outcome should be. i've played this game since ow1 first launched and have well over 1k hours in just competitive. i am high platlow diamond, and i'm frequently paired with teammates who appear to have never played this game before while simultaneously being pitted against godtier players that simply do not miss. blizzard thinks that balance means you get trashed for 5 games in a row and then curbstomp your opponents 5 games in a row. see? it's balanced. it's insane, and i'm done with this garbage."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-25,"do not play this game, or else they will never fix it. very frustrating especially in ranked, always get ai teams vs top500 premades, awful."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-23,"literally  graphic's isn't upgraded, no new features for update after 2 years"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-22,"the switch to 5v5 was fresh and fun at first, but as time has gone on the game has shown itself to not be very fun. especially if you're a tank, or support main. if you're a tank, be prepared to swap in an awful rock, paper, scissors that heavily favors the first tank to swap due to ult economy. support? learn to run for your life, as your teammates get instagibbed. graphics, and sound are great. character design is solid, though the balance is atrocious. never a good sign when they buff a character while believing they nerfed it. f2p has locked everything behind an overpriced paywall. there's zero meaningful progression, and the game's matchmaker must be drunk to justify it's choices. games are either ez claps, or impossible. fun, challenging games that could go either way? they're so rare that i can't even remember experiencing them. there's pretty much zero feedback in comp after games now, so it feels like qp. i get what they were trying to do by hiding your sr, but it's a terrible change. nevermind, that your shown rank is make believe bs that has absolutely zero impact on your hidden match making rating. i sincerely hope blizzard figures it out before the game is dead."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-22,"ow1 was my number one multiplayer game to play, i loved it! what is this ow2 rubbish they've replaced it with... it just feels wrong, the 5v5 does not do it for me. there is no team work anymore, everyone dives in, the tweaks to characters feel off, i honestly am so sad to not have the game i bought anymore, why can i not play ow1!? proper gutted but it may be time for me to find another game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-22,"complete nonsense, what do you let the critics play if they rate almost 80 and the users are 1, have you completely stopped respecting the players there?"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-22,honestly the worst downgrade i've seen in video games! they care more about pay to play rather than an actual enjoyable game. my own advice is bring back overwatch 1 because forcing people to play this new  update is a disgrace to gaming. michael
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-21,"this is a massive downgrade gameplay  balance of players  competitive and qp i see the same 3 characters in every other game everything that i like from the orginal they took out examples balanced characters that you can play each one, group finder, overall good modes for each season like christmas, not blizzard trying to get a dime and nickel for a  skin that 20 usd who in the right mind is paykng 20  dollars for a skin it should at most be  0 loot boxes people where did it go matter a fact where did half the  they promise go and stuff they took out from the original this game is clapped i would like to play this game and enjoy it not to get forced to play soljuon im a dps player or what ever her name is its the same 3 people soljuon roadhog and ana i barely see other players using other characters its sad really im not at all good at this game like low plat in overwatch 1 havent even touch comp in 2 because i know its the same 3 characters if im bad at soljuon but the enemy has one lost garbage at its finest they took a pretty good game except for double shield and 3 tanks 3 healers we wont talk about that lol and took a huge blizzard  on a game i hope nobody plays this ty game so blizzard loses money will that realistically happen no but i wish and to end the whole depression of a  game i give overwatch 2 a solid 210 it would have been a one but widowmaker is still fun so that the extra 1 point more you get"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-21,"i played and bought overwatch 1 and was excited as overwatch 2 launched and i had my progress and heroes saved. but this last updated showed me that i dont want to play this anymore. if i have to buy a hero for 10 dollars, which other may not have, this becomes pay to win. as one of the big players in this industry, you were not forced to do this. beside everything which have accumulated in the last years i have to say you lost a customer today blizzard. i hope you will loose all your costumers, so that your shareholdervalue principle becomes unprofitable."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-21,great game but its sad that if i wants to play the new hero on launch i have to pay for the battlepass.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-18,"overwatch 2 released horribly. i think most people will agree with me on that. long queues, horrible micro transactions and poor progression meant overwatch 2 was mainly looked down upon. however the core game, the part youll be playing the most, is extremely fun. somehow id sunk 50 hours into the game in the first two weeks, and have over 300 hours in it as of writing. blizzard has also started to surprise the community with sudden updates, most of which are good. overwatch is a game id recommend anyone to play as its already good, but going to get a lot better."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-18,"a god awful sequel to a good game. pointless barely changes enough to even be seen as a sequel its an update, an excuse for them to monetise the game. locking new heroes 50 levels deep in the battle pass or making unneeded changes like removing flash bangs or making changes to doomfist who was a fine dps. overall a stupid game that forces players who want nothing to do with their greedy battle pass or new game mechanics to play the new game providing nothing for the fact we purchased the game and bringing up the excuse that because it is free to play that they are fine monetising most if not all aspects of the game. absolute disappointment ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-18,"the game is just not fun. matchmaking is awful. trying to rank up is atrocious. former 7 season gm from season 1  7 and i cannot get out of gold. if i try to grind, it takes days and days. it just doesn't have the fun of a valorant or cs go"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-17,"matchmaking is atrocious, im in gold and get paired with bronze players against a full team of golds also the heroes are even more unbalanced than in overwatch 1, genji gets nerfed for no reason and the top tier characters get buffed wtf"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-16,"oh boy! a new sequel with absolutely no difference from its predecessor, with every downgrade imaginable such as it's monetization, matchmaking, balancing it makes you wonder why they wanted to put in place this sequel it was for fuging greed"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-15,"ive never ever revied a game officialy on any website but this game made me make an account, only just to say that its worthless.. how come v2 of any game can be worse.. worse of it all they closed servers of overatch 1  why? because they knew that everybody would still be playing 1, because ovw 2 is a piece of sht. good job blizzard u were usually shtty, but u always want to go up a level higher. i hope microsoft buys u out, and maybe  just maybe fires all of ur ceos and will make some decency out of the sewer that blizzard is now... rly.. how come is it possible to be in a gutter and yet go deeper.. ovw 2 is trash  dont play it i dont recommend it!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-14,"what a sad excuse of a sequel to overwatch, a game i always had only love for. they got rid of every incentive to play their game and added an absolute cash grab item shop... they deleted player levels and with that the reward of a lootbox per level up. they removed almost all stats of previous seasons 130 and made it so you can only really unlock anything with your credit card. overwatch 1 was so much fun, but now i feel like the time i spent was ultimately wasted by them deleting everything. they nuked this game. they nuked overwatch. rip"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-13,"it is a lot like ow1, however, a smaller team, more imbalance and there is a vile lean in the direction on paying  loads of money for a whole lot of  all. matchmaking seems to be poorer, competitive ranks mean nexttonothing and the game is less interesting than it has ever been. take an 8 year old game, add a couple of maps, a couple of characters and a game mode. make it free to play and charge people a ludicrous amount of money for what they could have earned by playing the last game or for new skin crap. blizzard trail blazed, now they sell out. but gamers are a ty bunch and will sink there money in regardless."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-12,"esta guapo, pero todo esta muy caro dentro del juego a excepcin del pase de batalla y el emparejamiento del modo competitivo simplemente apesta."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-11,this game is dead to me. there's literally no point to play anymore. you don't earn anything by playing anymore unless you pay money for the battle pass and then there's no magic there because everyone always gets the same  and it's mostly  save a couple good skins here and there. you don't earn anything by playing comp anymore because your rank is going to be continually dropped every season so you'll probably be in your rank perpetually unless you absolutely grind your face off. and the cherry on top  comp matchmaking is an absolute  joke. continually being matched with literal first time players. being matched against plat when your team is silver and below. no more. this game belongs in the trash.  overwatch and  blizzard.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-10,"rip to ow1, a much betterpolished game. ow2 is entirely unplayable. it feels like they were going in the right direction for ow1 with ow2, they took a giant leap backward. catering to professional play also doesn't help either. now that it is free please don't waste money on it. it used to be fun now it's unfortunately tedious at most."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-10,"i'm really pissed of. i loved original overwatch. i spent so much time in that game, had a great moments when i was playing solo or with my brother. i loved and i still do love most of the characters introduced in overwatch tracer, brigitte, cassidy mccree originally, soldier 76, winston, reinhardt, sombra, mercy, etc. and even in overwatch 2 they introduced kiriko which became instantly one of my favourites. it didn't really bother me for this game to be just one big update for the previous one, instead of full sequel. in the end, it's free and there is still going to be i hope at least pve story mode. but the way blizz decided to make monetization system is just unforgivable. they truly fked that up. not only they randomly locked half of the characters in roster for every single person who didn't buy watchpoint pack, they also completely destroyed progressionrewards system. that involves cosmetics and heroes themselves. new heroes, you can acquire by completing battle pass, but the old ones, you have to unlock them by paying with virtual currency. which ofcourse you can get only by using your credit card. what is it? is blizz saying that you can get those coins by playing? oh, you mean those 60 coins you can get only once in a week by completing weekly challenges? well go fu yourselves there in blizzard with this bullsh. that'd be ok if legendary skins for heroes, wouldn't cost 2 000 coins and bp 1000 coins!!! are you outta your mind?! and blizz have enough guts for coming on game forums, saying that they are not satsified with this progressionrewards system as well, so that they could say there will be some changes in season 2. guess what! they didn't change literally anything! f you! the saddest thing about all of this is the fact, that the game itself is still fun, it's still enjoyable, the gameplay is still great. but all the things around all of this is just pure awful bullsit that never needed to happen. i'm sick and tired of watching these favourite game franchises of mine getting butchered and destroyed by some  in nice outfits who only wishes to  money out of faithful gamers. i'm sick that i have to leave another great game i used to love for it's wonderful gameplay and characters within really good story and this wonderful universe. great job blizzard! you fuked it all up again!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-10,"this feels nothing like a sequel at all. most of the character's kits aren't changed, save for a few, and a pve mode that is still unfinished, and locking new characters behind a battlepass? nice attempt at trying to grab our money blizzard. it feels like a cash grab, locking some potentially good characters behind a paywall, and making us pay for a battlepass so that we can access them. disappointing how overwatch 2 turned out."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-09,edit initialy i gave 0 for hero lock but after season 1 it turned out that unlocking recent heroes is kinda easy. they also partially turned off sms protection for the old users. it is not that bad now.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-09,when i heard that overwatch will have a some kind of a revision and stuff i was excited but all of this excitement was turned into despise for the game as currently you either have to grind like crazy for just a hero the skins are not even worth it and as other games have this thing where as long as you pay for one battle pass and grind enough you can just get it again and again but ow doesn't has this and really its a bad ordeal to give players a battle pass with compared to other games has no worth. other then this the game is great and all thou the game for me like its build for two tanks instead of one its okay as well i guess but ow will never be the same as it was before and until the devs get it and revert it all back with all the good as little as there are changes to the game i will not be playing. thank you blizzard
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-07,just terrible. so much greed on display. such poor matchmaking. dead within three seasons. edited and updated 16052023 they cancelled pve hahaha imagine being the kind of moron who bought 25 skins only to have the major selling point that was dangled in front of your nose removed. couldn't be me.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-07,"overwatch 2 para muitos  um fiasco e extremamente abusivo e com muitas micro transaes. sabe, acredito que o jogo continua divertido, mesmo sem ganhar a quantidade de skins que vc ganharia de forma gratuita, vc ainda teria que comprar o jogo. remover as antigas lootboxes pra mim  algo bom, no joguei o ow1, portanto no sei o quo recompensador era ganhar skins de forma gratuita. agora, como o jogo  grtis para todos o jogo necessita de micro transaes para funcionar. meu nico contra  o preo alto das skins, sendo antigas ou no, esto caras demais  ainda assim eu comprei a skin da kiriko bruxa xd. meu maior desgosto com o jogo  o launcher pssimo e mediocre da blizzard, o . muito ruim, lagado, lento e buga muitas vezes no permitindo que eu jogue. alm de eu ter q entrar no launcher sempre que clicar no ow2 na area de trabalho. o site da blizzard  lagado, no abre rapido e demora pra baixar o launcher fui baixar o launcher recentemente, estava baixando a 30kbs e minha internet no mximo chega a 8mbs, uma vergonha pra uma empresa bilionria. fora esses pontos negativos, pra mim o jogo  divertido. muito desafiador no sentido de jogar bem com determinados personagens, exigindo mais tempo para pegar maestria em um heri. a experiencia  bem vasta, consigo jogar horas sem enjoar. 071222 aps mais de 100h de jogo volto aqui para deixar minha decepo e minha tristeza em relao ao jogo. falta suporte em atualizaes constantes e suporte em tickets e chat. jogo no tem suporte, vc tenta falar com eles para pedir ajuda e no respondem. dificil gastar dinheiro comprando skin e no ter nenhum suporte. valorant tem mais suporte do que ow2. riot  blizzard ????? kkkkkkkkkkkk arte  9 diversoprazer  9 peso 2 som  8 personagens  10 histria  8 suporte  0 peso 2 media  5.9"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-06,"overwatch 2 is just an update to overwatch. but whats worse than that, is that it keeps removing content and putting a price tag on anything that was free in overwatch 1. developers keep breaking their own games by not playtesting. they put a pricetag on everything, and i mean everything. i hate to say it but i think that it would be more financially responsable to invest in nft's. they added souveneirs, which is basically just a slapped together 3d model copy and pasted onto an emote. they literally serve no purpose and not a single player i have seen has even used one in game. they also added weapon charms, which are also, just 3d models copy and pasted onto the same cosmetic. they removed all sense of progression, and now, the only thing that you can show off as a medal is payed nametags, namecards. prices for skins are so insanely high. why would someone pay 20 for a skin i got for free years ago, i dont know. seasons are very disapointing considering they lock all the heroes under a paywall. rammattra for example, is not available to anyone, but, if you buy the premium battle pass, you can unlock him instantly. there is no reason to make the player grind 70 hours for a new hero other than to sell the battle pass. this game is no longer fair since in the future, players with new heroes may have an advantage over others if the hero is broken or cannot be countered. when i first tried the game paladins, i saw that all the heroes were locked under a paywall, this instantly made me like overwatch 1 more since i could play all the heroes whenever i wanted. now in overwatch 2, i see many other games that exist to be multitudes better. this is very sad that blizzard, microsoft, are so greedy they were willing to ruin what i thought was one of the most well designed videogames. this has taught me one thing though, you can slap 2 onto a name for an update, and put a price on everything, absolutely everything."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-06,"they had 6 years to develop this game and they changed nothing. only a couple of new maps and heroes, the meta is broken and the game is still somehow badly optimized. this game deserves the 1.510 it has. update they locked the new champ in the battle pass, they lost the one point i gave them"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-06,"the economic model is so bad you need to pay to get the new hero, wich is really stupid in a game when you need to switch your character to counter the picks of the ennemy team, overwatch 1rst was realy better on many points."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-05,"it's such a huge step down, yes the game was dead and the only way to bring back popularity was to make it free to play but this sequel feels like a lazy attempt to squeeze money out of the fans, the game always has such awful issues with proven rigged matches to make players addicted, scummy micro transaction schemes when originally skins were free to earn now cost 20 for one. 5v5 was an awful idea and the game is always so unbalanced with its characters and now has an incredibly grindy battle pass system"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-05,"this is one stinking pile of garbage. they have turned a beloved game into one giant shooting fest. teamplay is no longer a part of the equation because it's basically every man for themselves trying to do as much damage as possible. there are snipers and oneshot kills everywhere. this is an active choice blizzard has made to cater to a wider audience which will slowly turn this to a generic shooter. now with the freetoplay model, a ton more players are in the game, and the short queue times are possible the only positive thing about it. it brings a crap load of fortnitelike players who has no clue of what teamplay means. not a single person is paying attention to what is happening around them. everyone is focused on the nearest enemy and you can ping out enemies, and no one cares. if your playing solo random queue, it's basically a lottery to see if you are lucky enough to get into a team that actually knows what they are doing. on top of making the game less fun to play for support, they've added a super expensive shop and a battle pass that means absolutely nothing for the player. it's just another way for them to milk money off their player base. in ow1 i occasionally bought a skin. in ow2, that will never happen. this game has turned so bad for support players that i'm seriously considering stop playing. this is from a person who have enjoyed ow1 since day one. in it's current form, i absolutely hate ow2. added 2022.11.29  the first season ends in one week and the game is still total  they haven't tried improving anything to make it more fun to play for support. matchmaking is totally broken. you can end up in the losing team 68 times in a row, even though i am top healer in 70 of the matches. tanks are still out damaging dps heroes and there are a ton of people playing tank who doesn't have a clue on how to play the role. going 5v5 is the worst decision blizzard has made. one bad tank, one tank that throws, and the game is over. they have literally made the most important role the one that people fail the most playing. they made the changes to appeal to damage dealers, and guess who plays tank...? damage dealers that have zero clue on how to play. ow2 is still a total disaster and messed up garbage . stay away if you don't like frustration, long queues and people who don't give a crap about their teammates. i 100 hate this game and people who have made it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-04,"on its own the game might not be absolutely terrible but it's essentially worse than overwatch 1 in every respect. in an unprecedentedly stupid move, blizzard chose to completely replace the original game with overwatch 2 and take away the original game from everyone who bought it since 2016."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-04,"they ruined all the good mechanics from ov1, those that i hated in the old game now i remember with longing. everything is ruined in overwatch 2 the system for obtaining items for heroes, leveling up, rewards, and even scores at the end of the match. it is not clear for what purpose they ruined the tab mode during the match now you cant quickly understand how much damage i caused or healed, you need to compare your units with allies, information about the level and joint play of opponents and teammates is now also hidden. i definitely don't want to play this game. it remains a mystery to me why blizzard took overwatch 1 from me and forced me to play a new donation dump"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-12-03,forced deletion of overwatch 1 5v5 instead of 6v6 less abilityteamplaybased ability rework of dps doomfist feels like a deathmatch after playing it a bunch. still a great game. removal of most tacticalteam abilitys catering to all aim no brain typical run of the mill shooter players abandoning wow arenapvp base.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-30,"there's something wrong with this game. obviously its not a sequel but rather just a patch but thats not it. im selecting 4 instead of 5 mostly because 4 is red and i wouldnt like anyone to think that i think its average enough to spend time playing it. anyhow, in no particular order what feels bad is 2cp is gone so all my favourite maps like anubis, volskaya, hanamura are gone. new mode called push is not something im looking to when waiting in queue. and queues its a brand major release with marketing from them but it already takes 10m to find a game. whats more, i paid for ow1 with a promise that everything else in the game will be free but now ow1 has been deleted from my account and what i have instead is f2p ow2 with battle pass thats full of useless things, has very few interesting skins, all of them hidden behind absurdly high levels of bp that i wont be able to do without ruining my real life, so i guess thats a way of forcing me to pay which feels sleazy. and now even heroes are behind bp? in a game thats all about changing heroes midgame? where every new hero is op at a release? is that basically p2w direction? i can literally play wolfenstein enemy territory from 2003 with my friends but keeping ow1 on my acount and maybe releasing an ability for people to host their own servers? you know, letting people play a game they literally bought in the first place? we cant have that at modern blizzard! theres one less tank so goodbye to my favourite role of being an offtank. all tanks got buffed of course, and playing as a support feels like being an npc for dps to kill without a 2nd tank for peel. dont worry though, you can always 100 of the times pick moira due to her escape abilities until youre bored to death or get a new hero kiriko cause shes quite mobile as well. ah yes, shes behind a paywall for nonog players so i guess maybe you cant. have fun being an npc. soon, new tank will release thats said to not be free for og players which will make that split of fun even more skewed towards people who pay up, or grind several hours every single day to let me check notes ah, be able to pick a hero in a game about picking heroes. games are mostly about you being bored to death while you snowball the other team, or about being perpetually frustrated before finally giving up while its the other team who snowballs you. matchmaker is terrible. i had more equal matches in hots and that game is on lifesupport for gods sake. paladins, fortnite, tf2  in no other game winloss felt like such a coin flip from a matchmaker. the only thing great about this game is art and how polished it is. i just wished all those artists worked on paladins, not overwatch or other genre altogether. its such a waste to put such beautiful design in such bad gameplay. this is and it hurts me to say this but this is new blizzard game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-27,"i mean, its pretty much overwatch 1 just rebalanced a bit. a couple of minor changes to each character and added two new ones. the gameplay of overwatch is generally pretty fun, thats why i felt like most people were playing it so much when it came out. but the general nostalgia has pretty much worn off and most people realize this game is old and kind of boring at this point. the gameplay isnt that boring, the game is simply too old and thats what makes it boring. i mean if its your thing to play the same game for 8 years plus, then have at it. the predatory monetization and  comp system though kind of make this game even worse. at least in overwatch one i was able to collect a decent number of good skins simply through free loot boxes i earned playing the game, now you can only earn what is on the season pass or pay outrages amounts of money for the skins that you want. i mean if you never played overwatch one than you may enjoy the game, but if you are an og then itll probably bore you in a few weeks."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-26,this is by far the worst game i have played in the last 4 years. they managed to turn possibly the best team based shooter into a horribly designed team deathmatch. they completely revamped a game with playing into something comparable to a  copy. positives  free  improved audio  improved visuals  doomfist no longer instakills  removed lootboxes negatives  battlepass  pay to win  turned a team based game into a deathmatch lobby  glitchy  broken settings  sojourn  no workshop  incredibly overpriced items in the shopminimum 10 spent to buy anything  a real charm that can be shipped to your house costs less than the in game equivalent  so much visual clutter  advertised as this amazing team based shooter with a perfect story mode that hasn't been releasedit will probably end up costing 70 for some garbage similar to the pvp  the newer legendary skins have the quality of epic skins in ow1  the newer characters feel more like paladins champions compared to overwatch's heroes  roadhog  sombra  visual changes that interfere with gameplaythe sun  bastion  removed tabmenu levels to check if you have new players  reselling old skins for 3x the cost of them in ow1  new maps feel unpolished  rushed

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-20,"absolutely horrible monetization and technical part of game. i'm always dreamed about farm 450 years on all skins in game, or pay 12,000 dollars. blizzard, wtf"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-19,this doesnt even feel like a new game. blizzard should be ashamed of themselves for what they have put out. no wonder why jeff kaplan left this dumpster fire of a company.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-19,they took a very good game and gutted it of its strategy and depth then added a predatory monetization system. it's now a sad reminder of the game that it was and you cannot go back to the better version because they killed it for this patch with a 2 on it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-19,worst experience ever i had. theres no fun and gameplay only grind. ow1 is better 100 percent! now its just waste a time...
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-18,"this game wants your money. at every opportunity, it has prioritized wringing out every penny from its patrons over being fun. monetization plagues this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-18,"free game  more toxic players, no rewards for playing, a lot of bugs, rage and sadness. they destroyed one of the best multiplayer shooting game to get a little more money that people still don't want to give them. gampley makes u rage, smurfs are everywhere and at the end of the day u are getting nothing. just bring back old overwatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-18,"1. 5v5 is really stupid since none of the hero's from overwatch 1 were made for a 5v5 match up. 2. the prices for skins are atrocious, like i don't know who at blizzard thought it was a good idea to make the battle pass 10 and then make legendary skins 20 plus tax. its legit a scam 3. they didnt even release they part of the game that made it new. the pve isn't even finished and they still insisted on release they game. like god damn"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-18,"overwatch 2 is a great game! i really liked it at first, and still like it at this day. i had an argument with friend. he said that microtransactions and battle pass ruined the game. but it didnt. the only 1 thing about this game is 2 characters being in premium bp, and skins, their cost and loot boxes. he had overwatch 1 and has it i mean, ok you dont want to play without skins but, is it really worth? you are not gonna play the game because you cant afford skins? and then comparing it to csgo skin system? and comparing the games microtransactions to the battlefront 2? and ooh he totally talked about release version of bfront2 why not play this game because of skins and 15 games to unlock chars? its the same game! maybe theres no 6v6. but it atleast fully exterminated 3 t, 3 s meta issue. it gave symmetra players less shield gain. but totally this game is banger! and if you hate this game because only of skin system change. shut up, you're annoying."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-17,"this game is great, who cares that you actually gotta do something to play a new hero, stop complaining about that because its way better like that. the game is really good game play wise and i know its just a copy and paste from overwatch 1 to 2 and i know the skins are 30 dollars.... you know what never mind 30 dollars do you really think ill pay 30 dollai bought it........ goodbye!"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-11,"i have been playing overwatch 1 for over three years and considered it one of the best games ever even when it barely got any updates except for skins. therefore, i was originally very happy when i heard that overwatch 2 will come out. however, my experience with the game after 150 hours in it showed me ho wrong my excitnmment was. this game is a a disappointing and lame update and cannot be considered a sequel in any way. this is overwatch 0.4 since they are actively removing things that worked and ignoring obvious problems like balance of characters. my biggest problem with this game is the battle pass which completely ruins my experience by being a greedy and cheap way for bobby kotick to earn for his new yacht. the absence of balance, disappointing updates, lags, locking of characters behind levels, and the greed regarding the received awards makes this disappointment one of the worst games that i ever played. jeff kaplan leaving really did change the course of overwatch for the worst."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-11,"the game is hot garbage. at first i struggled to call this game a sequel, now i struggle to call it anything other than a regression. the changes are minimal, the bugs are rampant, the progression is pointless and the monetisation is despicable. on top of everything, this comes at the expense of ow1 which i can no longer play anymore, glad i bought the disc when it released! hurray! if any game has ever warranted a minus score, overwatch 2 is it! blizzard continuing to push the envelope in abject failure."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-07,"this game had so much potential to become an esport great. there is nothing like it, but it has basically become inaccessible and unbalanced for those not willing to spend money every season on the battle pass. a game that touts inclusivity has become the posterchild for the class divide. if anybody from blizzard ever reads this, just take a look at heroes of the storm and be prepared for what will become of overwatch. such wasted potential."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-07,"blizzard is a fraud and shameless, giving us this pure garbage after long waiting and all they have done is make some ugly new skins and add pc characters cuz they still think they are so cool but seriously it just their illusion."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-07,"this game is so bad i don't even know where to start. so i'll start with bullet points. abusive monetization system you thought loot boxes were bad? how about grind for 8 months for 1 skin lacks incentives to play little to no coins to push people to paying outrageous prices for skins or to buy battle pass. no more levels, no more xp, no more boxes. i never thought i'd want loot boxes also an abusive form of monetization, back 5v5. honestly i just hate it. it doesn't feel better, as a tank playersupport? it quite frankly feels worse. tanks decide the outcome of every match basically. ruined many kits. many heroes are straight up worse than overwatch 1, and now feel pretty homogenous due to them basically gutting cc. no more real hard counters. basically if you like this, just go play fortnite, it's a better and now similar game with less abusive practices, and it's generally more competent at development. killed overwatch 1, a product i paid for. i'd still be playing overwatch 1 honestly. i want nothing to do with 2. no pve, yknow the thing that was supposed to justify it even existing. numerous typos and poor lore, no excuse, especially because 1 was vastly better and more polished phone system. blizzard is absolutely going to sell your phone number by the way, but yeah if you don't overpay for wireless you're out of luck. granted i would recommend never playing a blizzard game. pay to win new heroes are locked deep behind battle pass, or surprise surprise if you buy it you get them instantly wow. this practice is so unbelievably scummy i decided to never play another blizzard game again. they've permanently lost me as a customer. i don't care who buys them or what they do at this point. i could keep going on. overwatch 2 is straight up inferior to the original in almost any way you can imagine, and they destroyed a product people liked and paid for in order to bring this abomination into existence."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-07,same game like the first one  share your phone number with china company blizzard? a big no!
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-06,"its a shame. ive played overwatch since early 2017. that version of the game was fine. cc and shields were their own issue but it made sense with 2cp. maps. the biggest thing about ow1 is that the game felt rewarding. i could sit and play overwatch for hours and have almost all the skins from an event they were doing. in overwatch 2 the gameplay itself feels better but the game is a lot less rewarding. they stripped the on fire system, they got rid of the cards at the end of the game. the worst thing they did to old players was the new shop system. i have every skin from the original game, and i got every skin for free. the new shop makes that impossible, legendary skins cost 2000 credits, credits can only be earned by completing weekly challenges. you get a maximum of 60 coins per week, to get a leg dart skin id have to complete challenges for 33 weeks without spending coins. this game is a greedy cash grab and i hope blizzard changes their store prices, otherwise this game will be dead before the pve comes out."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-06,"where lootboxes. it is now item shop and bad battle pass, and the skins cost 20 dollars in the shop. wow"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-06,"this version of the game only survives because of its predecessor. the game is not a sequel. it is a lie to say it is ow2. the game is fun because ow1 was a great game. they did not make it more fun or better. when a company refuses to provide any content or balance changes for around two years, how can you objectively state that these changes are better? they created a content drought and made players starved for any type of content to help make any changes appear in a better light. in my opinion, blizzard and activision's choices have been worse for the game in the long run for a short term benefit story of their company. the product as a whole is utter trash. removing features that existed in ow1 or that semiexist i'm on fire portrait and personal playtime progression was an unnecessary and poor decision. the decision benefited no one and only cause discourse for players who spent a lot of time earning their playtime portrait. they could have easily removed it from view in gameplay and kept tracking it, but have it only display in the player's profile. which they sort of do already, except it no longer progresses anymore. they also created a monetization system that makes people miss purchasable loot boxes. skins that players have been able to earn through grinding that gave players a different incentive path to play the game was completely removed. it would be one thing if the company actually spent time creating brand new skins and charged for those, but to charge for skins created by their predecessors that used to be in a grindable form, and to charge around 20 for those legendary not mythic skins, is a complete scummy tactic. they also rushed their release of this version of the game because they decided last minute to completely change everything they were working on in regards to their pve campaigns. then, they want to shield themselves from criticism by stating this is early access. when in reality, they originally announced the real ow2 back in 2019. assuming they had plans for ow2 prior to announcing it publicly, they actually had over 3 years to prepare. this release has not been an acceptable one from my perspective. i refuse to give activision blizzard a free pass because they changed their minds last minute and did not give themselves the proper time to prepare for the changes they needed to make for a successful f2p game. it is very disheartening how little they care or even consider the financial reality of their customers. people who have supported this company for 2030 years, buying almost every game they have released. i understand that purchasable loot boxes earned them a great deal of money and that there was pressure beginning to mount up in the u.s. government about gambling in video games advertised for kids so they wanted to get ahead on making changes before they were forced to, but overpriced cosmetics and anticonsumer tactics are not the way to make up those earnings. i would suggest that no one play this game or purchase anything from this company until they aggressively revise their monetization model."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-06,"lazy garbage. that's the best summary for this game. and i'm saying it after over 2000 hours played in overwatch 1. let's start with good will be brief  improved sound quality is really noticeable, guns sound pretty incredible, ambient sounds like footsteps are mixed more clearly, so you'll know there's enemy around  switching from 6v6 to 5v5, reducing amount of shields and cc in the game makes the game quicker and less tedious that's it. if you think that sequel should introduce new mechanics and visuals to the point it feels like a brand new experience, then ow2 is not a sequel. it's a patch modifying and mixing already existing game a bit. it feels as fresh as a rotten corpse that you put some fancy dress over to call it alive again. going into some details  switching from 6v6 to 5v5 made the game even more steamroll heavy than before, around 80  90 of my games were just an miserable experience where either my team just blasted enemies to the point they left or the other way around  game still expects high level of cooperation from total strangers. it's still in this weird place where you can't really pop off but one weak link in you team often means loosing the game  playing as support is horrendous and ungrateful job that will get you yelled at by dps going behind enemy lines to die instantly  horrible toxic community of players. game has no social tools, no guilds which would help to mitigate at least some toxicity that were promised in the ancient times by kaplan when he was still working on this game. getting called every possible slur in this game is just bread and butter  if you though lootboxes in ow1 were scammy, wait till you see how much currency you'll need to buy any skin in the new monetization model, not to mention unlocking new heroes in battle pass  it was just plainly broken during the launch with enormous queues and constant disconnects. to give activisionblizzard some credit  it got fixed at the time of writing this review, however it shows how incompetent they are during every major launch similar problems occurred with wow  the whole telephone fiasco overall ow2 is disappointing, infuriating experience that is just lazy reskin of the first game with some questionable monetization on top of it. ow2 just confirms once again what a horrible  activisionblizzard has become. this game is just void of any imagination, innovation and polish. getting repeatedly punched in the face is more fulfilling experience than this game. about pve  i simply don't care  activisionblizzard can promise portable blowjb dispenser or cocaine or whatever they want on their roadmap. pve is simply not here and i'm way past believing any aaa publisher at this point when it comes to post launch content planned. i'd write some more, but i refuse to put more work than the team responsible for creating this abomination. overwatch 2 is an opposite of fun. don't play it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-06,"its not even an update, they changed only ui and thats it, they didnt added any heroes in a while to add them at this moment. ive lost my decent rank just to be bronze again. no more free skins. 010"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-06,massive downgrade from the previous game in nearly every way and is making one of the biggest cash grab moves i've ever seen in the gaming industry if overwatch 2 is successful we'll be seeing alot more cheap sequels where they release a update and up there monetization to insane levels of anti consumer price points and content pay walls the original overwatch was a huge step forward for gaming overwatch 2 is a step forward for anti consumer marketing and content locking

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-05,"this is not overwatch 2 and everyone understands this very well. greedy managers just wanted to sell the same game twice. in fact, this is just a patch and a battle pass, and it is not clear what they have been doing all these years. although no, everything is clear  they did the same thing as always they saved money, so that later they could write it out to themselves as a bonus. but this is not the worst. it has become impossible to play the game normally  it takes 57 minutes to find the game and cheaters play in 90 of the games. they just run around the whole game with aimlock and don't even try to hide. reports do not work at all, the same cheaters have been playing since the very start of overwatch 1.2 and no one cares about it. i spent a couple of thousand hours on the original overwatch, but i never intend to play it again, nor any other games from these people."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-05,"c'est overwatch 1 avec une refonte. certains hros brisent tous les autres, les tank sont des dps, le systme ranked est  chier et il n'est pas rare de tomber sur une team de  tour de force c'est de gagner une partie en classe quand on tag seul ! et comme a ne suffisait pas, le cash shop est honteux !"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-05,"predatory monitization and lack of content. they promised a pve mode but they didn't deliver it, and on top of that the in game store is just predatory the skins you got for free in the previous version are no longer free, you need to pay at least 10 for a single epic skin and those dont even look like epic skins."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-05,"overwatch when first released stood out as an interesting take on the 6v6 pvp space. although not a big name in recent years overwatch still managed to bring itself a healthy player pool, all be it unbalanced at times. so when activision blizard announced overwatch 2, many were skeptical of the big promises made such as a more balanced meta, the removal of the most shield abilities, and a pve story mode. and in a result that shocked no one, i am sad to say that none of these promises came true as overwatch 2 is simply a worse version of the original. ignoring the obvious controversies such as the phone number requirement, removal of loot boxes for a pure microtransaction currency, the move to a freetoplay and season pass, and the missing pve story mode, the game itself is a more watereddown version of overwatch, choosing to favor toxic behavior. behavior such as spawn camping, player hunting where 23 players constantly kill the same player the moment they spawn, and most frustrating team stacking. a concept where an entire team would stand practically on top of each other so that the overwatch 2 hitbox system would not properly register damaged delt nor damage received. a concept made even worse with the recent buff to dps characters as each kill now increases damage output, movement speed, and reload speed. these gameplay issues are only made worse by activision blizzard's move from a 6v6 model to a 5v5 model. although many praised the change as a fresh take, the removal of a second tank hero has only managed to hurt the overall balance of the game. with the rise of dps heroes and the reward of blind firing, the missing second tank is nothing more than a painful reminder of how overwatch used to be, as a second tank would practically slow down a game. turning it into a more strategic game rather than a dps madhouse. a problem with the meta that activision blizzard clearly knew about as the reworking of all heroes has led to an overall power gap. and to be honest, i could typically accept all these issues as it is a freetoplay game. but, what really made me write this review was how unstable overwatch 2 is on older hardware. and the clear punishment being made to those like me who can't afford the latest in gaming hardware. for some dumb reason, overwatch 2 when installed for the first time will be preset to high graphics. this isn't a problem, most games now a day do come preset on high. what is the problem, the game is incapable of making any graphic changes without a game rest. a feature in computer gaming i have not seen since. well, ever. and this is for everything, every graphics or framerate change requires a game reset. now many would shove this off as a minor inconvenience, and normally i would agree. but it is with that game reset that the old hardware punishment comes into effect. upon a game reset after setting the game to low graphics, nothing happens. and i mean that literary. nothing happens, the game refuses to open. this is the only game i have ever played where it refuses to let a player change the graphic quality to anything other than high. now, most would say my 7th gen i5 and 1050ti are the problems, yet in other games such as apex legends, gundam evolution, destiny 2, and the original overwatch, i never had an issue such as this. what this tells me is, my game does not have the lowquality texter files or mediumquality files as medium looks identical to high. i know this because there is a setting in the blizzard launcher that allows you to reset your game setting. which means the game is reset to the high settings. thus resulting in an unplayable lag fest. now many may find my 1 out of 10 rating on overwatch 2 to be a bit harsh. i would argue it's being generous. because there is a 0 option. overwatch 2 is nothing more than a cashgrab game taking advantage of the loyal players who stuck with the original through thick and thin while also punishing them for not adopting the toxic gameplay behavior they are pushing or those unable to afford the latest gaming hardware. to say that overwatch 2 is a massive disappointment is for once. not a massive understatement."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-05,"thanks for the useless crap game. it is full of toxics and cheaters. tried once, will never play again."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-05,blizzard literally killed it in past 2 years and now they are just digging the grave deeper
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-04,"the rebranded overwatch 1 as overwatch 2 and charge insane prices while fixing non of the issues that drove players away. cheating and verbal abuse is the norm in this game and no matter how many times you report these players nothing ever happens to them. the only time any action ever happens is if you popular streamer or youtuber catches said person on video. gone are the loot boxes, replaced by selling skins for 2040usd, let me remind you overwatch 1 cost 40. the free portion of the game is a complete grind and with all the cheaters and verbal abuse you will find yourself quickly not wanting to play. to make matters worse the game will have days where it matches people so poorly it's just one team being rolled by another over and over. avoid this toxic game and don't give blizzard your money."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-04,"playing healer in this game makes you feel so irrelevant to the outcome of the game that it makes you want to self harm. if my tank or dps are worse than the enemy team, you lose. congrats. oh, and they take away my ow1 to give me this garbo? blizzard wtf. the spirit of this game is dead and i hate everyone in it"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-04,"none of the problems of o1 were solved some heroes still way better than others, elo doesn't work for 5v5, skins with downsides gameplay wise, overpriced shop. but they even added more problems with less teamply because of the 5v5, maps with so few healthpack you have to go back to spawn, asking for a phone number to register, and removing o1 alltogether. blizzard keeps on following the wrong path, sad."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-04,"the game is actually a lot of fun, but blizzard is so predatory with their microtransactions can you even call them micro anymore? that it ruins the game. it costs more money to buy two skins then overwatch 1 costs to buy. there's no feeling of progress, if you do all of your weekly tasks you will have gained a real world value of about 60 cents. you would be better off wandering around a city looking for coins on the ground. the sad thing is i wouldn't mind spending some money for some cool skins at a reasonable price. 20 for a skin is not reasonable. not even close."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-04,"overwatch 2 is just a shade of former self. the new monetization is just a scam! you pay absolutely enormous amount of money per item, and you don't really have any good way to earn it for free grind for 8 month or spend 19 to get yourself a new skin for a champion. the new battle pass is basically filled with garbage and has 3 to 5 decent items and no currency. absolutely doesn't cost 10. no pve. it's just not ready at the game launch. a lot of bugs. this game could be played for several hours with friends but nothing more. hope it would get better soon or die fast."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-04,overwatch 2 ist just overwatch 1 just with a few little changes. the most important change ist that you will have to pay for every single piece. its obvious blizzards strategy ist to let us pay what have been free for years. the other changes are so minimalistic that a single patch would have been enough. blizzard is gone evil and we have to accept that. the gameplay hasnt changed very much. its like the overwatch we all loved.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-03,ow2 made me write my first mcreview. after playing ow1 since beta this game is one of the worst downgrades in the history of gaming.  removing original ow because it doesn't bring enough moneys is a joke  onetank concept doesn't work at all  terrible balance  not playable as casual player  battlepass is a perverted joke  maplighting looks weird and offbeat how can you even make maps look worse in a supposed sequel?  teamwork is nowhere to be found. it somehow worked very well in ow1 but not here!?  kiriko is a joke bcs she can counter any cc  1 point bcs new maps are ok and sojourn is an ok addition i uninstalled battlenet bcs. ow1 was the only thing that kept me there. unless ow1 is returned thats it for me.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-03,this game is not worthy to carry the title of 2 this is just overwatch one sprinkled with some new content another embarrasment from blizzard
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-03,"ever wonder how to turn a rough piece of gold that needed a few polishing here and there, to a pile of dog sh well let me introduce you to overwatch 2 as an ow1 veteran imo, the old game was a rough piece of gold that needed only a couple of balancing fixes to make all characters fair and not oppressively op! ,with a better anti cheat and a pve down the line. if blizz wanted to expand on the game they should've kept every other thing the same and added a pve mode using the same ui same graphics  add a few skins and reward systems with some sort of skill tree for that mode. but , what happened was a new game , in this case ow2, which needed to be codded with worse ui, worse ux, worse sound fx, completely nerfed icons including comp rank icons, and a greedy money grab type of battle pass system that is so disgustingly implemented to be a cash buffer , nothing else ! the game ow2 feels soulless, lifeless and extremely boring to play, oh and did i mention that cheaters are also an infestations in this version of the game im not gonna call it a sequel. with throwers and leavers just holding every lobby hostage as well. at this stage i feel this will only be hype to new players being attracted to the freetoplay model of this supposed sequel, version actually, but it will eventually get 'bored of' and withered as those players go to other interesting games. it's crazy to me how a company valued at billions manages to pull the trigger on it self in such a gory fashion. i hope microsoft pulls the plug on this game like they did with many other titles in the past that is to say if they successfully takeover"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,"the gameplay is ok, in fact, it's exactly the same as 6 years ago. pve mode? nah. next year. monetization? squeezed to the max, with battlepasses, seasons, the removal of free loot boxes and paid ones and the ridiculous overpriced skins 26 for a skin, a weapon charm and a spray. in some countries it is even illegal to sell this bundle, because as the law in those countries says, there can't be a discount on non individually purchasable content.. i don't think this game would be alive if it wasn't overwatch. yeah, maybe it will have its playerbase, but i think it'll be the size of the apex legends' one, if we're making comparisons. and yeah, it's made by ea and respawn, and they have a really bad reputation about the game, the general unfairness and the random updates they did and do to keep the game fresh, the 500 heirlooms and server crashing and going down almost everyday. so comparing overwatch, to apex, is.. strange. i won't be playing this game anymore, since it's so downhill, i don't think it can get back up."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,i can not play the game because i am poor and have a prepaid phone number.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,"as someone who played this game since 2016 i have to say that this game isnt exactly bad but its the most dissappointing, disrespectful, infuriating game sequel i have ever played in my life, they literally cut off 2 years of an update cycle to work on this game and what do we get? a recycled garbage with battle pass seasons and insanely expensive microtransactions. for example overwatch 1 was 20, now for 20 on overwatch 2 all you get is one legendary skin that would be free to get on overwatch 1!!!!! they knew people were gonna hate this game so they decided to close the original game so now if you want to play overwatch you need to play the sequel filled with microtransactions and overpowered tanks like zarya who has 2  shields now making her impossible to kill. speaking off tanks you must play role queue if your into comp becuase if the enemy team has 3 tanks and 2 healers then its pretty much game over anyways in conclusion this game is exactly the same but they decided to either ruin the whole purpose of different characters like mei and doomfist or make characters super op like zarya, cant forget about the endless microtransactions aswell which they this season decided to invest in alot for this halloween event then to actually make better servers or a fun to play halloween event  you blizzard and stop sexually assualting your workers for sake and develop the game!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,fun at first before you slowly realise that there's no real rewards or stuff you can grind. every skin is overpriced and it'll take you weeks of daily gaming before you can buy a skin with the free coins you get from challenges.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,"overwatch was once the single greatest pvp game that existed. overwatch 2 seems just like a cheap cash grab that adds nothing that would justify its advertisement as a new game. the monetization is just ridiculous and it's clear that at least the management at activision blizzard doesn't care about quality content and pleasing the community anymore. all of this adds to it just not being as much fun anymore. incredibly disappointing because i really, really want to love this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,"after almost a month i can confirm that the game still have server errors still a shameless cash grab and has nothing to do with the word sequel its not even a good update its a downgrade no progression system no on fire no free way to get skins a lot of the heroes are broken , removed from the game , op , and guess what if we ever get a new hero its locked in the battle pass .. maps missing underwhelming event challenges are repetitive 20 skins i feel second hand shame for this thank you blizzard.   not really  ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,"compared to overwatch 1, extrem downgrade. same graphics, no level system. no rewards, battle pass rewards are a joke. another greedy cash grab, could have been a beautiful game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-02,"6 years ago overwatch was released, and it was made to have a fun experience, the tf2 killer. overwatch 2 is a downgrade in every aspect."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,my only question at this point is what did devs do for 6 years? i heavily disagree that 3 new heroes and few maps could take that long. what happened to pve? storyline? new abilities they had teasers for. did they really scrap all that and decided that overwatch 2 is what it is now? ok i'm waiting for overwatch 76 then.. or what? p.s. this game is fat from bad. it's fun and decent. it just doesn't fulfill 2 part.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"i wonder what people would say if the first part of the game did not exist. if only this were the first overwatch. you would probably say that this is a great game, right? but everything is relative. however, do not forget that this is a new game. all these loot boxes may not exist, as well as other familiar goodies. it looks like this rework of the first part was made only for the sake of more profit. all this seems so only at first glance. game currency can be bought for real money, or you can earn in the game, though you will have to sweat a lot. in fact, the prices in this game are much lower than in other games from blizzard. the issue is not even the price. you can pay for nothing at all and play for your own pleasure. opportunities will come to you with time. the problem with this game is that it was presented to us in the wrong way. they release the game without looking back, forgetting that people also played it two days before the release. and when they came here again, these people were shocked by everything around  pay for everything, disconnection, the disappearance of a couple of old heroes with bugs, and in general, yes, many, many bugs! they should have tested this better when the beta was too short for the game of the year. a complete failure of communication with regular customers, i think this is the main drawback of the game. but there is actually much more to enjoy. after playing for a few weeks, i understood the whole idea and philosophy of this second version of the game. it looks like a jet visually, but it's really a completely new game. the team selection system made me happy. just imagine that i was sitting on bronze for two years and it was simply impossible to get ahead. now i'm getting closer to platinum and it's a completely different level of play. i don't even notice how the hours spent in this game fly by. and even now the game is not perfect. but no one is asking you to pay for it. blizzard is still working on the game and we hope that everything will work out. i want everything at once, especially when we have been waiting for the release for several years. but sometimes when you wait a long time, you forget what you can get in the end. most people here in the comments refer to overwatch 2 as their first love. just imagine that you met your first love again after six years and you have been waiting for it all six years. she has grown a big fat ass, wrinkles have appeared on her face and she is no longer the same as you loved her before. but during these six years she gained a lot of experience and became beautiful in her own way. if you knew all this in advance, would you be disappointed at the release? i don't think."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"how far has gaming industry fallen? it once used to be you pay for the game you get all the in game content. then you must pay microtransactions like in 2014. then you pay to have a chance to get all the in game content like 2016. now from 2018, you pay to be able to get some of the in game content. if you live in the u.s. and get paid 8 minimum wage, to finish the battlepass you need around 80 hours of grind, that is 640 for one legendary skin. if it was the good old times you can pay 200 to unlock more in a lootbox system of 2016, or pay 69.99 for a deluxe bundle microtransaction of 2014 or get everything for free through premium edition of 2002. battle pass, the worst sin of gaming, pay to able, p2a, the worst monetization form possible. you pay your boss to be able to work in his sweatshop for the pride and accomplishment above you fellow slaves."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"what a way to butcher such an amazing game... the new monetization with the ridiculously high prices, the trash battle pass system instead of loot boxes, the sorry excuse of progression are just a few example of the downgrade. both the quality and quantity of new cosmetics are much lower, while the prices are 2 or even 3 times higher. then there's the horrible matchmaking system, the incrising number of players leaving or throwing matches, a lot of bugs, fair share of them gamebreaking, and the ongoing connection issues. plus the unbalanced heroes, which are either never viable or way over powered, since they weren't meant to be in 5v5 instead of 6v6. they are also removing a lot of content earnablefree skins and loot, maps, beloved systems and options. on top of those, they show false advertisement and fake discounts which are actually illegal in certain countries. half of what ow2  blizzard is doing is a scam."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,game with unbalanced maps and heroes.  boring gameplay  after 2 days playing i already feel boring af have most awful monetization system ever  rly i can't remember worst than that  for 1 leg skin u need to play 8 months oh and btw if u not played first game u have only 5 heroes to play. other u need to unlock by playing aloooooot of games or u can donate ofc for example u need to play 150 games to unlock ash  yes yes 150 games  worst battle pass in game industry. for example in apex legends if u donate to buy battlepass and you are quite an active player u can farm premium coins from it and buy next battlepass for free. in ow2 u get only skins. yesyes no premuim currency  nothing. oh u wanna get next battlepass and u alredy get 100 lvl on the previous one huh? well we don't care. donate or get lost. i highly recommend not playing this game and not support devs. maybe if devs fix all that it can be a good game. but not for now.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"blizzard ruins yet another once great game. sure, it's free to play but only if you have a postpaid phone number that can be linked to your account. essentially what that means is, it's free as long as you use one of the few major cell phone carriers  if you don't, you literally can't even play the game. that's arguably the worst part about the game, but there are plenty of other atrocities as well. this used to be a game that cost 60 and then rewarded you with cosmetic items free loot boxes just by playing game after game. now, you'll get absolutely nothing or very little from simply playing. everything else is locked behind a paid battle pass that requires a ridiculous amount of grinding to complete, thus meaning you'll have to individually pay anywhere from 1 to 30 per cosmetic unlockable. let that soak in a bit. blizzard has deliberately forced out all lowincome players as well as people who are simply 'smart' with their money by using a cheaper cell phone carrier by requiring them to have a cell phone plan through verizon, att, tmobile, etc. why would they do that? simple  because they only want people with a lot of disposable income to be able to play, because they're much more likely to throw away hundreds to thousands of dollars on these unlockable items. plus, blizzard is a corporation that promotes sexism and thinks its okay to sexually harass women. hard pass for me. go f yourselves, blizzard bigwig  bags."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"just imagine, they made baddest game even worst. get back my lootboxes, highlightcards, public levels, medals, onfire condition. why blizzard?"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,so far it is a well developed beta  cant w8 till the full game will be released.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"this is a disgrace to everything ow1 stood for and an insult to both the original developer team and the gamers. disgusting monetization. legendary skins are literally impossible to earn via playing the game. you need to open up your wallet wide as hell. everything i earned in ow1 till now just by playing and buying the base game, would now cost 4000. that's the worth of my account as it seems but also the game itself is a huge downgrade. visually ugly. every map looks like mexico in hollywood movies. yellow like a chicken soup. matches have 2 less people, but visually it is a bigger chaos. and they literally got rid of the importance of roles. now every game is just a team deathmatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,bad game. mmr is terrible. not fun after not many hours of gameplay. i would not raccomand the game to a friend
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"the game is o.k if it works. the game is buggy af, like players are walking like slime over the map, or in the middle  the servers do not respons and you have to start over. but the bests are the prices. it is like a slap in your face, if you played overwatch one bevor. 25 for a skin? how about no. blizzard, fix your game and give back the lootboxes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-11-01,"overwatch 2 feels like theft. they have taken away a game i purchased  i enjoyed but had issues with and replaced it with a worse version of it. it feels very much like the very same game with some new modes. the new skins don't impress, the new maps are fine, but i find myself missing some of the older ones as well. the games ux is worse overall outside of playing menus  whatnot. some very basic quality of life improvements that have been in games such as tf2 since forever are still missing looking at you customizable skin loadouts, i want to have a halloween  christmas custom loadout on every character just like i do in tf2. the game plays fine mostly, but it's hard to overlook the lack of improvements in overwatch 2. the whole thing feels like a huge disappointment. everyone else will talk about how bad the new monetization is, you don't need me repeating it. overall it  and if this game's monetization doesn't improve i'll be out  have completely uninstalled the bnet launcher before the new year. overwatch was the last blizzard game i had installed. in summation, overwatch 2 feels like an update, and a bad one at that."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"most dlcs come with more content than this game. also the bugs, horrible design, and lack of passion are really next level with this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"overwatch 1 was a game dear to my heart. in 2016, it breathed new life into the 1st person shooter genre. the game started getting stale and updates were painfully slow as time went on. when overwatch 2 was announced, i was slightly hoping this sequel would breath new life into a game that i really liked. unfortunately, overwatch 2 fell short of that and then some. here is a list of what went wrong, from most severe to least severe 1. battle pass  this is the worst attempt at a cash grab. activision blizzard knew what they were doing when they implemented a battle pass for overwatch 2. stealing an idea from another game and making it so much worse has got to be corporate greed at its finest. i bought overwatch 1 at 60. i will admit i paid a bit more on loot boxes, but that was the extent of my support. a weapon charm ingame is more expensive than a weapon charm in real life. explain that to me. not only that, but you removed overwatch 1 a game i paid for and forced me to update to overwatch 2. that kiriko skin being locked behind the shop is the biggest slap in the face you ever did to me, blizzard. this was your greatest sin. 2. activisionblizzard's controversial history  blizzard, you fostered a toxic work environment for your employees. for that, you will never see another cent from me again, due to the many allegations that you are accused of. 3. unfinished release  blizzard, you promised the community a pve main story game mode. you promised big changes and great things. you delivered nothing! you have let the community down. this game was not ready for launch. you dumbed down the art style and graphics. you know that ultimate gauge? its less detailed and less bright. it looks so...dull. to the developers and creators i have nothing against you, and i know you're working around the clock to make this game better, but your company that you work for is absolutely the worst. the postitives? i'll give you one point out of ten for new voice lines, a bit of content, and kiriko. unfortunately, not even kiriko can save what you have released, blizzard. thanks for giving us this hallow shell of a video game. this is nothing more than a cash grab. you are a chump. so pay us 20 for a halloween skin. i'm sorry, but i can buy a much better game for 20 on steam right now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"immensely disappointing, and dishonest to call it a sequel when its literally a patch. why they would destroy overwatch 1 rather than maintaining two games is beyond me"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"ranked system is just a big mess up, unfair and frustrating. either you can win 78 games in a row either you can loose much just because is not made well. even if there are many heroes, only few of them are played, just because some of them are overpowered. there is no fun anymore in this game, again a great license ruined by  !"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,this game is a complete joke. it's a completely new level of greediness. the only way to get anything is to buy a battle pass... oh man i miss the lootboxes
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,how to ruin my favorite game 101. greedy blizzard. game lags like hell also un top end pc and 3gbs ethernet. what have you done? why?
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"an obvious cash grab, with perhaps the greediest, most anticonsumer monetization i have seen in a aaa game in recent years. the whole justification for the sequel was the new pve content, but that's been pushed back, so instead it just feels like an update on the guise of it being a sequel as an excuse to force the playerbase to engage in this horrible new system. i played the first couple days with some friends to judge for myself how bad the monetization was... it was even worse than i expected. i had been playing ow1 since early 2017 and had easily put over 1000 hours into the game, but i quit and uninstalled this greedy, predatory cash scheme so easily, that's how bad it was."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"blizzard become same if not worst than ea with ow2 and battle pass monetization. they are not asking money they basically already forcing you to pay. in end ow2 becomes more expensive then ow1 and at same time nothing have changed in game only minor changes to take money from you. even if you decide to play, dont buy nothing so blizzard can understand that players dont accept this attitude to them."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"mess , disconnects, poor matchmaking and way over priced skins, for an example in paladins 1500 crystals 20 you can get 3 legendary skins in overwatch 1 legendary skin it will cost you for the cheapest 19. halloween event is a joke as well. bring back loot boxes, even though i didn't like them i would rather have them back."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"game was supposed to be fun, ended up as a disappointment. firstly, the pricing is just absurd, more than 30 bucks a skin is insane in a game with hundreds. playing free to play feels like a grind without reward. the ranked system has somehow gotten worse with only minor changes to cause it. alot of the newer changes completely changed the game for the worse. as hard as it is to admit, loot boxes were smarter than the person who thought of implementing an expensive system that is designed to scam the player. balancing has improved but balance changes are not as common as they used to be. how did it take a week to fix bastion and torb. honestly disgraceful. the event is so unrewarding, voices lines, spray, and battle pass xp compared to in the past when we would basically be given a chance to get the new skins for free. the game doesn't reward the player for the time they put in. blizzard is actively attempting to silence the hate on reddit and twitter. ps, a singular skin doesn't fix the countless accounts that were wiped in the merges from errors."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"r.i.p overwatch, so basictly, they stole our money so they can spit out, this. overall game is great, they made a lot of changes that improves gameplay, but at the cost of everything else, you cant get skins that were free, they rid off most of great system like leveling, on fire system or medals after the game. i will never play this game ever again only because fu blizzard really. biggest disappointment ever."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"a great game ruined by greed, the game itself is fun and the balance is quite good imo, but it's sad, so so sad to see what could have been... and what actually it is, they removed so many great things just to redirect you straight to the battle pass, which is not that bad but could be way better season 1 the cyberpunk skins should have been all in the pass for example, instead some of them are on the shop for some absurd prices, the halloween even has a bundle that is illegal in some countries, they removed the fire meter, the leveling, the end game cards, the find a group function, increased the owl token prices, removed the best lootboxes in the market, blizzard was already a greedy mess full of harassment in its work environment, with activision now the ow team is going to be overworked and underpaid for sure..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-31,"anti consumer, why is the game i paid for and the skins that were obtainable, now put up for like 40 thats so messed"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"i never ever thought overwatch 2 would turn out to be that bad. sure, the gameplay is still fun but it already was the case with overwatch 1! i'm done with this pathetic excuse of a developer who killed the first game so he could work on a sequel with the worst battle pass in history, the worst ingame shop in history and the worst service you could think of when you hear live service game. it seems like blizzard removed more parts of the game when they actually added with ow2. in fact there're less maps now than at the day ow1 died. where the hell is rialto or numbani???? they say maps are missing because they changed to a seasonal model with a given map rotation? the  is this fortnite? i always come across the same old and new maps now and the new ones aren't even good gameplay wise. they look good sure, but you can't play tracer or any high mobility hero anymore cause you get stuck at every damn thing placed on the maps. i never thought it could get worse than halo infinite when it comes to the battle pass. blizzard proved me worng. no in game currency or meaningful progression besides the bp. and new heroes are even locked behind the 55th tier?!?!? blizzard made ow2 pay to win!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"i understand how blizzard makes decisions now...just pick the greediest option no matter what because some schmuck will enable their terrible behaviour. sure not only do we have battle passes, but one of the worst in the industry. lock characters even though character swapping is a major aspect of the game so its essentially p2w. all of this put into an overwatch 1 patch that came years too late"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"the transition to a freetoplay model has ruined a lot of the joy of progression and overall consumer experience. i have very little interest in playing, much less spending money, on a game made by a company that is as monetarily predatory as blizzard."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"it's not just a low effort cashgrab greedfest, it's a low effort cashgrab greedfest that replaced a good game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"the game play is fine, but the monetization is predatory as can be, the updates take far to long for a game riddled with balance issues, and the additions are lacking. this game is an afront to the original, and frankly, to god, because the evidence you'd find for the greedy nature of the company behind the game in it's shop and their craven tendency when it comes to facing the player base is overwhelming, just like my worry for this game. i truly, and i cannot stress this enough, hate the fact that these greedy cowards destroyed a beloved game in the pursuit of money. may this game receive it's due improvement, and it's developer receive their due virtual mauling by the fans."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"dog water, they didn't break the game but they messed up literally everything they touched. the battle pass encourages bad playing just so you can get points on a pass that you'll get nothing of worth from. the challenges for the battle pass makes it feel like a job that you have to play multiple hours every day."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,disgusting and predatory store and the removal of once free content has ruined this game
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"overwatch 2 is not a sequel! it is basically an update and downgrade at the same time and should be called overwatch 1.1. pros  one tank less is actually better  new maps  it is free cons  hero characters can only be bought with premium battlepass and a lot of grind new players have no other choice  monetization is a joke.. feels like a scam, especially for new players  visually it looks the same  promised pve mode has not released with overwatch 2  social features like voting for best player in your and the enemy team were removed  servers are worse  you have a prepaid phone number because you can't afford a phone plan? sorry for you, but blizzard won't let you play this new game  many other things. just read all the other reviews! from me personally 110 overatch 2 is like the removed first game but with some improvements and many downgrades. if blizzard would've released this as an update, i would give it a 610."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"i'll go into a few specifics that jumped out at me after playing for a few weeks 1. the ui is abhorrent a. it's not clear when you're in queue. i played with friends and at separate points we each thought we were in queue without being in queue because it's so poorly expressed in the ui. b. you can't find your old ranks from ow1 seasons. why? c. navigating to your current rank is difficult. why? d. post game no longer shows notable stats. why? e. they removed the on fire visual. why? f. when i clicked on a friend to try to add them, i had about 5 options that amounts to doing negative things blocksquelchreportetc. they're pushing people toward a report everyone culture with their garbage ui design, and if this is the blizzard of old i'm familiar with, they do bans based purely on number of reports, regardless of their merit. i couldn't imagine a worse system for handling toxicity, particular when, as i've already said, the system encourages reporting through its ui design. why is reporting someone easier to do than finding my rank? what is the focus of this game supposed to be? 2. microtransactions. a. skins are like the equivalent of 18 dollars. that's criminal for a game that puts you in 1st person most of the game so you don't even see your skin. it's not like csgo where you can trade skins either. b. every 2 games i get the privilege of hearing some waytooloud triumphant trumpet noise that's meant to positively reinforce you for just being in the game because they want you to spend money. it's extremely obnoxious and predatory anticonsumer behavior equivalent to casino machine noises manipulating people into spending money. i don't want a reward noise every time i finish a quickplay game, win or lose. that's absolutely obnoxious. c. there are numerous buttons that try to filter you toward the battle pass. i don't know about you, but i don't like playing a game that is shoving an advertisement in my face every 2 seconds, particularly not a aaa game. again, as an ow1 player this is a very noticeable downgrade that just can't be overlooked. 3. hardware requirements a. the game looks fundamentally the same some lighting differences but the hardware requirements are significantly higher. this has undoubtedly shut out some ow1 players with suboptimal hardware when they were forced to upgrade. for me personally the game doesn't run as smoothly on low settings as ow1 did, and for one of my friends it's not even runnable any longer simply due to the hardware upgrade. this would be an easier pill to swallow if it were a significantly different game from ow1, but it's clearly not. 4. release week it was a bad joke. while queuing with my 3 friends, i was simply shut out of playing dps with no explanation whatsoever. this was after an update that apparently broke the game's basic functionality. no notification on blizzard's side that there was an issue  i had to search forums to find people asking questions with zero response from blizzard. i might be more inclined to tolerate this type of nonsense if it weren't for the fact that this update to ow1 has been years in development and they still underdelivered on their product to the point that it's glaringly obvious this is just a repackaging of ow1 to go for a cash grab. and it's not like the studio doesn't have the money to do better. 5. big brother. a. as an addendum to blizzard's hamfisted report system, they've added a feature that listens to you when you voice chat and records your speech, looking for offensive words. what offensive words are these? are some groups being targeted more than others? any transparency from blizzard on this whatsoever? no. did anyone ask to be listened to by a robot that gets to decide if they're being too mean? no. is this even needed when there are multiple ways to avoid voice chat and text chat, and even pings? no. they are the gods of your speech when you use their product, and you aren't allowed to even know the rules. but they may take away your ability to play if they so decree. you see the same exact philosophy in their ranking system. no transparency. apparently hamfisted, unintelligent decisions made that antagonize the player with no clarity. b. one of my ow1 accounts which was banned was also banned from ow2. hilarious, since you can get an ow2 account so easily. i guess a ban from 5 years ago applies to any game i'll ever play in the future now. cool design choice guys. i made an account just to share this rating. its that bad. what they are doing here is a continuation of what they've been doing spitting in the face of every consumer who plays their games, and i will not sanction this behavior by even playing a free game. i will look out for their products so i know which to avoid in the future. the world deserves better than open contempt like this from a company managed by evil people."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"overwatch 2 is a sorry excuse for a sequel, acting as an update to the original game rather than a new release. the launch was rough as queue times were comically long, making even playing the game a challenge. when you reach the end of the queue, you are hit with the realisation that the game is, on the whole, almost the same as the original. the change to 5v5 for casual and competitive matches has many players conflicted. while it removes the previous issue of shields dominating the field, the removal of a tank per team makes every character even more vital to a team's performance. in addition, the lack of a secondary tank causes players to revolve around the single remaining one, causing many matches to feel like a battle of two blobs rather than a constantly evolving, flanking environment. since there is no second tank to absorb damage, support characters are now mostly left to fend for themselves, causing the role to feel bloated in terms of responsibilities. the maps seem to adjust to this new team layout however, which is quite welcome. the monetisation for this game feels more greedy, pushy and downright exploitative of players starting in this entry. removing loot boxes to make way for a battle pass removes what made the game feel unique, and also stops players from regularly getting content for free. the generous nature of overwatch 1's loot box system, despite being predatory and a form of gambling, allowed players to receive random cosmetics by playing the game, making the inventory of every player unique. the linear nature of the battle pass will funnel players down the same cosmetic loop until they save up enough credits to buy a skin from the shop, while also filling up each player's inventory with filler items they will likely never use. the player never feels rewarded for their gameplay, too. the developers removed the old persistent level feature, replacing it with the battle pass levels. this defeats the purpose of the original system. battle pass tiers are temporary, meaning that a player will not feel as rewarded for consistent play time. the challenge system also fails to deliver any sense of reward. weekly challenges give a measly 60 credits upon completing every challenge, which in themselves are challenging for causal players without much time to spend. buying a legendary skin takes 32 weeks given that the player completes every weekly challenge, which is horrific compared to the previous loot box system where you had a chance to obtain a legendary skin almost every time you played. disregarding the monetisation and progression changes, which are negative changes to a once great game, overwatch 2 feels less like a sequel and more of a major update. the gameplay is generally quite fun, feeling polished and responsive. the stylised graphics feel unique and almost wonderful. but the same could be said for the original. i would be inclined to rate this slightly higher, but blizzard's desire to treat its player base like exploitable human wallets quells any desire to do so. in the future, blizzard may revert some of the removed features and bring back a rewarding progression system, however, until then, this game will feel like a hollow shell of a once great multiplayer shooter."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,a new blizzard scam game. they just want your money and dont give a  about the player opinions.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,the game is worse than before and now even filled with greed. a complete insult towards the player base.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"it's unfortunate they chose to move ahead with such a predatory monetization approach for this game. the least i expected was a similar f2p model like lol or heroes of the storm, where digital skins cost a reasonable amount and not 20 for a single skin! this is absurd... and since the only real sense of rewardprogression this game has to offer are the cosmetics as what we had with the lootboxes oh the good old days, this time around we got a battlepass with a few skins, and a bunch of useless crap that you don't really notice in game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-30,"what a trash game lmao. money maker. one legendary skin costs 18. its is insane, just watch youtube videos about it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-29,"complete hot steaming crap, ruined what made overwatch a great game. very little graphical or game play improvement, calling it a sequel is a joke. crap queue times, make it unplayable, queue for 10 mins to get a game. the games, are a joke, more instakills than ever, a steaming unbalanced mess. add in the disgusting monetisation, this is the worst game blizzard has ever put out, but we know that blizzard is dead now. funny how the critic reviews are so positive, yet the user reviews damming in slamming the game. does make you wonder about how we can see the critic reviews as any more than paid shilling"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-29,"easily one of the worst games of all time. there is fundamentally no rewards for playing, battlepass or otherwise. the gameplay itself is garbage where you either stomp the enemy team or they stomp you. do not waste a penny."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-29,"downgrade from overwatch 1, this game call itself sequel but it's even worst than previous game, also if you wanted to go back to ov1 you can't because they closed servers and force you to switch to this. this game deserves all hate. and to make this game better players have to stop playing it or it won't change."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-29,same game than 1. booring. unbalanced. stupid. money hungry company. no pve. like no ok cares abaut it. no game rewards. still same game thann 1

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-28,"i registered just to write this, overwatch 2 shouldn't exist, give me back ov1, i really hate them for this laughable battle pass and skins for 18 which you can't even see except potg, and when you customize that character"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-28,"i hate this. i hate all mechanics about shop, n i hate new shop, i hate new balance, i hate you. you just destroyed my favourite game. overwatch was the best shooter in the history, it was fun, alive, crazy, but overwatch 2 is just... blizzard... i had a better opinion of you. but you just messed up. give us back our old and nice overwatch"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-28,f2p but with an unreasonable amount of microtransactions. sounds familiar seriously?! 60 coins per week with no other way to get them other than buying them. how would one go about getting a legendary skin if they have no credits already? when you recycle content from overwatch one and now lock it behind a paywall it leaves me frustrated as i had worked so hard to get those legendary skins before in the previous game which are now locked by a paywall. now what is the real tipping point for me is the monetization of characters. who thought they could get away with this? i hope you are happy blizzard with your well deserved user score.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-28,"they made the healers an unplayable joke. i used to be able to dance around circles around any character with enough luck, zenyatta was my main and i could barely hit people the same way in this game, the field of view is off, the characters fly across the screen going a million miles an hour and back again so i have to guess where they are going to be every 2 seconds and that never happened in the last game for me always fine internet, they completely broke this thing. brigette used to be able to hold her own and bully whoever now you get stomped in half a second you may as well be a doormat. its awful awful awful, just do yourself a favor and uninstall this garbage till they change everything back and get rid of all the vicious predatory monetization too."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-28,"jeux tout simplement en cours de recyclage, les perso, les maps, les skins, la seul diffrence tant que maintenant on doit jouer durant des anne pour avoir du contenue qui tait gratuit auparavant avec presque aucune plusvalue. si vous aimez le titre grand bien vous face mais je ne participerait pas  ce massacre, entre problme de micro transaction pas corriger, confirmation par tlphone, bug des armes qui touche pas et perso enlever car manque de travaille sur ces dernier. et surtout payer pour du contenue de plus de 5 ans merci blizzard  activision."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-27,"all around downgrade from the already struggling first game. terrible matchmaking, cesspool of a community, and little to no reason to play after activision has tightened their chokehold on the development team and has fully enacted every cashgrab mechanic and strategy they can. servers hardly work, and if you ever dc from a ranked match, the game will actively boot you when you try to relog until you get a 'deserter' penalty, because blizz's servers are bad. very fun, very engaging."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-27,"imagine this, you bought a game for 40 bucks and after some time you get a free game with greedy monetization, bugs, imbalanced heroes, no communication with players, scummy illegal discounts right after skin released without even changing price, battle pass locked heroes and a clown skin for old players"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-27,"this is game with no balance and huge paywall. dont you ever try this crap, i hope develop team will be fired for this work'"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-27,"the game has lost almost all of the reward factor to play. except competitive. prices are exorbitant it's blizzard. who's surprised? 5v5 has made playing healer almost impractical, dps are freer because most of your counters were tanks and now there's only one tank per game. and tanks are as broken as paladins in wow pvp. congratulations . 0!"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-26,"played paladins for a year, tried to get into overwatch 2 for friends, big f. the quick play is such a lame experience. you will lose, except you polayed ow1 for years. this game is frustrating, get used to it or buy characters or skins to make yourself feel better. maybe the learning curve is too high, but even if, that's not a good point. ow2 feels gate kept. not recommended for new players. i see the fun, i see it, i do, but my god, get noobs next to noobs, otherwise it's no fun at all."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-26,"battlepass. i shouldn't have to grind in a game for a whole month to earn what i've paid for. removed a tank. more onesided matches. more skirmish less teamfight. healers  to play without peal from second tank. they neutered doomfist. introduced another oneshot hero anyway sojourn, like it's any more fun to be oneshot from a railgun than a gauntlet. no cc means practically no ult combo counterplay nanoblade. new heroes won't be free. they won't even be purchasable for the first month, you have to buy the battlepass and grind to unlock them. heroes will not be balanced on release. this game will not be free to play once new heroes start being added. it will be pay to win. all so whales who spend money get to curbstomp players who don't buy anything and feel good about their purchase. classic mobile game design theory. i've been with this game since sombra was released. it really hurts seeing a game i've been playing for that long take such a nosedive. hopefully a new, better game comes out that can scratch the same itch overwatch did, because overwatch 2 definitely isn't, and since i don't plan on spending any money on it, i guess blizzard has decided i don't get to have the same fun people who do will. i miss jeff."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-26,"one of the most insulting launches of any game ever. absolutely pathetic, even as a free game. bug fest beyond any possible repair. i'm hard stuck on bronze 5 because of a  bug that won't allow me to climb out on support which is the only role i give a  about. beyond the most insulting scammy piece of  game ever developed by any big company. even if the game by some miracle became the best game ever made, it'd still be forever tainted by it's  release."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-26,"the core game play of overwatch 1 is still present in its sequel, but it has given itself completely over to the monetization of cosmetics to a terrifying degree. cosmetics and other customizables for your characters are held hostage behind an oppressive battle pass that rewards you too little for the time you spend in the game especially when the time you're spending in it is not fun. the support classes have been left to the wolves, leaving them more vulnerable throughout the match, while tanks and damage classes have gotten buffs to increase their damage or mitigation. besides game play, server issues are rampant, and toxicity feels at an all time high. the potential for a great sequel to an amazing first game was close, but overwatch 2 feels like a stripped down, less fun, more shiny overwatch 1. the game is buggy, underdeveloped, and held hostage by the company that created it. it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of its biggest fans, and instead relies on twitch drops and other social media to increase its word of mouth. if this is the future of blizzard games, it's no wonder why world of warcraft and their other games have fallen short of the mark consistently. i would say that i remain hopeful that blizzard could see what has happened and respond or correct some of the issues present in the game, but if their past games are any indication, they're more comfortable monetizing mediocrity than making good games anymore."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-26,"thank you blizzard for the simulator of bugs and endless waste of money. terrible monetization, the players of the last overwatch got almost nothing. the players who played the first overwatch got the old sombra skin. thanks. the community is simply being bullied. the halloween event is the last straw, not a single gift in honor of the holiday, but just a pathetic compensation. if you want to arrange a holiday for yourself, pay. bb"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,greed took over this update of overwatch 1. in exchange for a few maps and three characters we ended up with a predatory business model. your overwatch 1 copy of the game has been replaced by this joke of a cash shop. yes the gameplay is great and deserves to be pointed out. yet i am disgusted by the decisions of activision. played this game for years. there is no alternative game that feels as nervous and fast paced which makes this situation heartbreaking. who would have thought that people would miss lootboxes... they had gold and it turned into this shame. the game doesn't deserve a score of 0 but it's the only way we'll ever be heard. i love this franchise but the people in charge don't seem to give their player base any respect.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,"the idiots who now run activisionblizzard basically ran any dev for the game out if they had integrity and wanted to make a good game, and what is left is a group who is dedicated to the corporate friendly, cashgrab, profits for shareholders model. gone is one of the best ips in gaming, ow1, which had amazing world and character design, fun team play, and awesome character lore, as slow as it was. ow2 is a shell of the former game, using the creativity of the first game to milk the players of every dime they can. instead of another game you just buy, it's now a supposed freetoplay model. what the free to play model does is bring people in who didn't care to ever buy ow1 but now have a free game to mess around in, in the hopes that eventually the company will convince them to pay money. first, what this has done is ruined the matches, as a flood of players who don't care about the overwatch team play now run rampant, trolling, throwing matches, feeding as badly played heroes, and taking any true competition out of the game. next, you'd think eventually matchmaking would keep these players out of the games of people who are serious about playing overwatch, but no. activision has implemented matchmaking that purposely creates games where new and bad players are put with skilled players or higher level players to try to convince them that if they have all the cosmetics the longtime, good players have, they will win games. the monetized instead of skill based matchmaking creates terrible games where one team is always steamrolled into the ground with little effort. monetization, in principal, wouldn't be bad. yes, if the game is to have ongoing content, it will have to be paid for. but that's what the newly introduced battlepasses should be doing. multiple times a year they want players to buy the battlepass to receive the cosmetics that once were earned through gameplay lootboxes and currency. now that we've seen the battlebass system and prepaid for the first one, it's clear that they are creating cheap and low quality content namecards, uninteresting voicelines, sprays you'll never use, souvenirs for the part of the game that should be keeping the game going, and have added a shop to put all of the cosmetics that players will actually want behind a second paywall. not only is it bad enough that supporting the game through the battlepasses all year gets you none of the desired rewards, but the prices are insane. one character skin will run you 2030, the price of many full games. and to ever earn enough of the currency you must have to buy one of these skins through the battlepass, it will take over 8 months. now that they don't let you earn event skins, the first even which would have been halloween, is a hollow, repetitive pve board that builds on the always recycled junkenstein, except there's no point in really playing it after a few times. the fun of the events was always to play knowing you were earning the very well made skins, voicelines, sprays, ect, and it was exciting to get that lootbox every few games hoping you'd have a new unlock. now all they are offering for grinding the pve level is a couple sprays and a charm. the only two new skins aren't very good, and all of the previous years holiday skins are also now locked at at least 20 as well. besides being the greedy, overmonetized version of the game created for shareholders, not players, the game has had nothing but problems since the launch. even after two betas, the game came out with servers crashing, people getting logged out repeatedly if they ever got in, and glitching left and right. the game is again completely out of balance, with games being decided by the team that sticks with the few overpowered heroes. the buffs and nerfs they've given entire roles to make the game more exciting have left entire roles to be sitting ducks, because they are both told they have to play better but their characters are less powerful and die easier. the devs promised more measures against cheaters, troll players, toxic players, people who abandon matches, ect. since the game started, it has been worse than the first game for all of these issues, and the devs are now silent about any of the promises they made. after the backlash of making players attach phone numbers to accounts to fight cheaters known as smurfs and other bad accounts, they immediately removed the requirement and all of the multiple accounts used by bad players to cheat were allowed to flood back into the new game. they are now present again in many games, and blizzard hasn't said anything about ridding the game of these accounts in the ow2, just as they didn't in the first. everything about ow2 is just bad and greedy game design in the clothing of the first overwatch. longtime players who loved the original game are being shoved aside for quick profit. overwatch 2 is a mistake and will never live up to the original. cheers, love"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,the game isn't good and it also promote fggotism i don't like playing as a fggot. the only good thing though is a lot of characters you kill are fggots i like that.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,"so, the game is free and despite that i feel like i got ripped off. the battle pass system is like the worst one i have ever seen. no way to earn premium currency in the pass, rewards are mostly crappy even in a paid version. battle pass is not rewarding at all. grinding battle pass feels useless as f2p player and real underwhelming if you pay for it. oh but you can get 60 free coins from weekly challenges. yeah, if you are grinding them. there is no way for a casual player to complete them all. it's not even worth it for so little. no free currency means that you practically get no skins aside from recolors you get form free pass. unless you want to grind coins from weekly challenges for like 2 years for one legendary skin. maybe a year if you are playing a lot. and well, gameplay is okay because it's just ow1. just copy and paste the entire game, remove 1 tank and change like few abilities and wow we got a new game for you guys. they did not even bother to remove on fire quotes despite removing the mechanic from the game. most heroes feel not balanced at all, doomfist is just straight useless. lazy cashgrab from actiblizzard."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,"gross monetization. extremely gross. i've known for a while that blizzard isn't the company it once was. the moment they got in bed with activision i knew it was over. but i still had hope.... now i don't. screw you activision, you destroy everything you touch."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,"em relao ao overwatch 2 a minha opinio sincera relacionada ao jogo e ao evento novo halloween 2022  de desanimo total, pois o evento no possui recompensas dignas pelo esforo se comparado ao overwatch 1 e ganha pontos de passe de batalha e  interessante ate o momento em que voc chega no lvl 80 e recebe a skin mtica que  o meu caso, j que atualmente estou no lvl 81 do passe e sinto que no vale mais a pena jogar o jogo at a prxima temporada, j que ao finalizar o passe descobri que a mecnica de progresso aps finalizar o passe e voc continuar jogando por mais 120 niveis para conseguir ttulos para sua conta que ficariam localizados abaixo do seu nick no banner o que para min e extremamente desanimador e me faz entender o porque deles no terem anunciado isso no trailer de lanamento o que passa a sensao de que no vale mais a pena jogar overwatch 2, ainda mais que o evento  muito simples e no possui nenhuma mecnica inovadora desincentivando a rejogabilidade, a blizzard tem que comear a rever o que eles fazem no ow2 porque no duvido desse jogo morra mais para frente devido ao numero de player diminuir devido ao desinteresse com o jogo devido ao fator de progresso e rejogabilidade no serem recompensadores. e vamos falar do passe que  o sistema de progresso inovador da blizzard para o jogo que  extremamente desanimador j que alm de possuir skins que no esto vinculadas a temtica central do passe, que seria uma viso cyberpunk do universo de ow2, no possuem relao simblica entre elas j que as nicas duas skins que seguem a temtica que esto no passe so da kiriko e genji e as outras tem temticas aleatrias como legionrios espaciais, uma sacerdotisa japonesa e jogadora de rcade, e as que seguem essa temtica cyberpunk que so as da windowmaker, hanzo, zeniata e roadhog esto sendo vendidas separadamente pelo valor de aproximadamente r100 ou 1900 a 2200 moedassendo que a da windowmaker e hanzo ainda no lanaram e no se sabe o valor que vo possuir. isso faz com que a rejogabildiade fique limitada aos primeiros 80 nveis do passe sendo que o marco mais importante e a mtica incentivando que jogadores que conclurem o passe se sintam desanimados em continuar jogando devido ao jogo no ser recompensador e esperem uma nova temporada para voltar a jogar. em relao a loja de skins no tem muito o que falar pagar r100 por uma skin s passa a sensao de prejuzo j que o valor agregado as skins do overwatch 2  risvel e nem vou comentar sobre barbaridades que nos foram apresentadas como pagar 700 moedas do jogo para conseguir um chaveiro. eu poderia resumir o overwatch 2 a um jogo bonito, com uma jogabilidade extremamente divertida  ainda mais s voc jogar com os amigos e com mltiplos modos de jogo interessantes para se continuar a jogar sendo o meu favorito o tct que se assemelha a uma corrida de armas aonde cada eliminao troca o personagem ate chegar na faca e voc ganhar por eliminao. entretanto, todavia, os jogadores podem s desanimar muito rpido com a jogabilidade e como no possui um sistema de progresso digno o jogadores depois de completar o level 80 do passe vai sentir que esta investindo tempo em um jogo que no recompensa o seu esforo, alm de existirem problemas de coneco no jogo que fazem que muitas vezes voc seja desconectado da partida ou seja expulso devido a inatividade estando ainda na tela de carregamento j que o jogo contabiliza que voc esta na partida s que esta parado de propositosendo extremamente desanimador quando isso acontece no modo competitivo e voc recebe uma punio por um bug do game. em suma o jogo e divertido e bonito mais no compensa investir muito do seu tempo j que voc vai jogar por 80 nveis recebendo itens e depois vai jogar apenas por jogar vai se divertir s que no final da partida no vai receber mais nada em troca."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-25,"literally just overwatch 1 but worse. as much as the loot boxes were hated at the time, i kind of wish they kept them versus going free to play and riding off of battle passes for making money. my major main complaint is that there is no way to earn anything you want through gameplay. yes there are skins in the battle pass free version but 80 of the levels have literally nothing in them and the stuff that you can earn is again, trash sprays and voice lines nobody cares about. not to mention leveling the battle pass as a free user is painfully slow, so if you do not pay for an experience boost that is legitimately no reason to levelit. they outright removed overall account levels for these god forsaken battle passes so literally all you rescieve is progression towards said pass...which there is no reason to level. ifyou want anything for your heroes now you are required to pay for them via microtransactions, a currency you cannot earn by any means except of a whopping 60 cents a week if you complete all of your weekly challenges. so, since most skins seem to cost 20, divide that by .60 you get 33.33. round that up you need to finish your weekly challenges for 34 weeks for a single legendary skin. so ya those loot boxes honestly don't seem all that bad all of a sudden when you would get one per account level and free ones for playing certain match types and one for free at the start of each event. somehow they went from a bad system to so much worse that lootboxes somehow look good. the people that had paid for overwatch 1 have pretty much had their money thrown in the trash because now the game itself is free and are now locked out of the decent version of the game and now have to play a worse version with a 2 slapped onto the title. good job blizzard, first you make a fool of yourself with harassment cases and poor business decisions,now you made things worse with overwatch 2."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-23,"the magic is gone, and i am sad. as a video game developer myself, and a very serious overwatch 1 player, i appreciate several of the changes that they have made, but the game now feels fundamentally unbalanced. this results in wild murderballs that make for multiple team kills per game, on a nearly permatch basis. overall, it plays faster, which i do enjoy. as a luciowinstontracer main, i have fun with them. but the changes to tanks encourage more freelancing, which exposes healers to assasination. in ow1 with 2 tanks, you could have an offtankhunter, and a defender of the healers. great. that was fine. now, if your tank hunts, your healers are at risk. if even worse, you end up with 2 backline snipers, and an offtank, it is autolose for the team, and truly an exercise in ultimate frustration for healers. they will constantly be on their own, or chasing the offtank that abandons them, or just supporting backline snipers as the opposing team keeps the payload rolling or controls points. team composition is absolutely critical. one mistake with the old 222 setup could be overcome more easily. double snipers could be overcome with a reinzarya setup or similar. now... no hope. becuase of this i absolutely refuse the role queue. i love my man lucio, but if i see double snipers on my team, and a dva, i will just be doomed. better off to go soldiermei so that i can survive myself, and maybe stall the other team. it is still a likely loss, but at least i have a fighting chance, rather than as a healer by myself. the good  tanks are now much more fun in general  new characters all play well individually  orissa is insanely fun, whereas i used to despise her boring holdground gameplay  it is pretty, little touches like improved vfx across the board really elevate it  new scoreboard is nice, can see ult status of teammates easily the bad  feast or famine momentum swings  can be ragequittingly frustrating as a healer  one mistake in team composition might not be able to be overcome  robot push maps are crazy long, exacerbating problems with a freelancing team  ui is much harder to use. reporting system is hard to use.  exiting the game takes 4 clicks. seriously? bad ux there.  good stuff like the fun leaderboard highlighting environment kills, jump pack kills, heals, is now gone. boo!"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-22,"the second part lured me because of the hype, at first i was too lazy to figure it out, but then i liked the mechanics in this game, especially on moira, sometimes you can play for 1 hour in the evening, at first it was difficult to enter the server, but after a couple of days the problem was fixed, donate i don't care, i not pay attention to skins, for playing for a couple of hours it's not bad at all"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-21,"i played overwatch 1 for so long now is a mess, everybody talking about how nothing changed and is the same game, but it changed a lot now is just mess fights it lost the strategy and the interesting part i feel like im playing unreal tournament in the 90s"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-21,"somehow this game manages to be both more complicated and more boring than the previous version at the same time. it clearly was made for some specific audience i am guessing an audience that doesn't want teamwork, doesn't want tactics, doesn't want to play support, and wants to just frag. but in the process they took away everything that was good about the last version. too bad."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-21,"doomfist feels fun to me that's why i give it a 1, if they nerf doomfist for the blizzard reason of him being fun i turn it into a 0. blizzard forgot an options button in the main menu. instead you have to press esc or go into the menu in the corner of your screen to access options. you know what has a dedicated button in the main menu? the shop. that is about all you need to know about this game and why you should not play it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-21,"one of the worst gaming experiences i have ever witnessed. completely unplayable for someone who is a new player as the game does nothing to try and match you of players of equal skill. there is no point in interacting with any player, mode, or objective whatsoever because you are never rewarded with anything, not even dopamine for getting a win. honestly sad that such a large company can put out something so pitiful and unfun in every way i can think of. one of the happiest uninstall buttons i have ever clicked."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-21,"originally this review was a 3000 word essay, but in the wake of the almost complete cancellation of the game's last remaining draw  the pve  i will update this review accordingly. overwatch 2 is one of the worst pieces of entertainment media ever. it took overwatch, adjusted everything into a singular aggressive playstyle, removing the validity of any other potential strategy, and then slapped on a shop that demonstrated nought but greed and an almost comical level of contempt for its player base. now, with the only reason the game was called overwatch 2 essentially scrapped, there's no reason to ever look at this game again, unless it's to laugh at how pathetic it is."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-20,"overwatch 2 is a halffinished product designed by blizzard to maximize profits i would call it stealing. what we currently have 1 removed many maps all maps of 2cp mode, numbani, rialto, blizzard world, havana. and junkertown was removed today due to bugs. 2 removal of torbjorn and bastion due to errors. 3 constant bugs, lags, crashes from the game. 4 monetization, which other games will envy with their ripping off. whoever came up with the idea of selling old skins for 20 should be fired after such an offer. 5 there is no promised pve content in this game. because for 3 years, developers have been busy with scandals, not with game development. 6 there is no normal progression system to support player loyalty. 60 donated currency skins cost 2000, and the battle pass costs 1000  this is very little. 7 everything that works is carried over from overwatch 1, but the differences for old players are not very obvious no! changing the time of day on some maps will not update them. bottom line at the moment, the game deserves the lowest ratings. the developers could not meet the expectations of the players voiced at the presentation, could not organize a normal launch of the product, could not create a normal balanced monetization."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-19,"great game, as overwatch. enough new content and more or less acceptable battle pass for new players. something is definitely wrong with matchmaking system. player pools are all mixed and matches are most of the times uneven. for now, competitive mode in it's current state is unplayable."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-19,"pretty much the same game as the original. except that it's actually worse. they removed loot boxes that you could earn via leveing up and you could actually get skins from them. now your only way to get skins is playing money. oh and you can earn like 2 recolor skins from the battle pass, that's it. should've at least kept loot boxes to be earnable via leveling for legacy account, and removed ability to purchase them, to comply with regional gambling regulations. also they added like 3 new characters and a map? yeah... honestly feels like a total cashgrab for , who will buy the worst looking battlepass i've ever seen."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-19,"the gameplay feels vastly inferior because healers are easily killed by flankers. whole game even with godtier tank healers is decided by dps. many dps like soujorn and sombra are insanely overpowered at this point in time. the biggest issue however is the predatory micro transactions. the battle pass isn't really rewarding for free players cuz who cares, srsly, about icons and sprays. they even added collectibles like emotes or charms that are badly positioned just to fill more space. there's also temporary 20 euro bundles that last 6 days and if you don't buy them, you will wait litteraly forever for it to come back. overwatch 1 was such a amazing game and overwatch 2 is just so many steps down. to further add, on ow1 you could earn skins on lootboxes and earn credits. it was pretty nice. now in overwatch 2 they bring oldddd event skins and sell them to players for 20 euros. it's silly at this point, they are selling summer ash on halloween time. it's beyond pathetic how we play for 1 week do all the challenges and only gain 60 coins for skins that cost 1900, granted the best skins are 20 euro and stuck behind a shop. yeah play 33 weeks to buy a skin. when 90 of them are stuck behind paywalls. edit, probably 100 every new skin has been paid walled. 4 years working on overwatch 2 and betas and this garbage that doesn't even show characters are on fire, or medals, or anything that made ppl feel good while playing ow1. is what they have to show for it. i was playing overwatch 1 at 140 fps it dropped sometimes to 90. overwatch 2 i play at 50 fps and drops to 10 constnatly, the performance is garbage"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-18,"the changes to the actual gameplay are amazing. the problem is there is no system in place to stop older players from playing with completely new players. my last 10 games have all depended on which team got more of the new players. the experiences players would wipe them within a matter of seconds to the point that most of the matches turn into the enemy keeping us in spawn. this is ridiculous and has ruined my experience. to make matters worse, the cosmetics costing nearly 20 is outrageous. i was willing to spend money on overwatch 1 because i always got plenty for even just 10. now it feels like they want to force even free to play players to spend money to get anywhere. i am done with blizzard games."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-18,"i have 1k hours in ow1, got banned in ranked season ow2 due to not being able to connect to some games found for 3 days. there is no point in talking about other problems, read in other posts"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-18,"blizzard died when they got acquired by activision. they turned my beloved game for which i payed 60 on release!!! into pay to win trash yes, gameplay is still fun and what i loved about overwatch 1, but they had no right to lock heroes in battle pass. cosmetics in overwatch 1 were 100500 times better and you could unlock everything you liked just by playing on weekends. but now you have to play 1 year full time to unlock something that is called legends skin, but looks like it is epic. do not approve. feels like blizzard is trying to get up my a55 and get me into loans to play their game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"greed and sloth are the main sins of blizzard. overwatch is an amazing game, and new modes plus team size change make it even better. but the lack of new content in sequel is tremendous. and after all you can no longer earn cool loot by just playing. you need to pay, and you need to pay much more than in other f2p games."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"i'm digging out my metacritic account just to blast this game. 90 or more of this game is worse than overwatch 1. the ui is uglier in general, the scoreboard is ugly, everything is unnecessarily large, bold, or buried. certain weapons sound and feel like crap after being rerecorded. no main page chat, no cards, no medals, no match rating, no endorsing the enemy  it's devoid of interaction. 5v5 is a mess. fights are now brawls and too chaotic. either you have one support so they run for their life 247 and then never play support again, or you have one tank and there's only so much one tank can do. tanks also get shafted into being reinorisasigmadva since the game isn't really balanced for this new format. still no detailed, with numbers skill descriptions on the f1 screen just wimpy generalizations. people trickle 247 or get exposed much more harshly in this new 5v5 format. achievements still require 4 people or more even though the format is now missing an extra player or require 1 game type conditions to materialize, not skill. you get basically nothing from just playing the game unless you spend money. i'm willing to spend money for some things but nothing? and why the f are skins like 20? stop chasing whales and go after plankton. make skins cheap and everybody will buy them. right now they get 0 and illwill from players instead. with the role out being beyond disastrous, the only thing good about ow2 is that it's free to start and now supports amd fsr. the spirit and strategy of it has been destroyed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,thanks for taking my 60 that i paid for a decent piece of game art in 2016 and morphing one of my favourite games into freetoplay garbage with the battlepass. if you wanted money less badly and at least cared about fans you could have left the original game playable. the whole situation is just a spit to the fan's faces and we will never forget it.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"the only nice character kiriko inaccessible by default, a visual redesign for the worse dumb plastic faces of the characters, an absolutely tasteless menu and, most importantly, a freetoplay grind with a battle pass included in which btw there is an absolute minuscule amount of normal rewards, meet overwatch 2. you may think no problem, i can get a good portion of skins at least for a donat..., but no, for almost a hundred bucks you will get coins for 56 legendaries that you could easily earn in a week in overwatch 1, and this despite the fact that the quality of the skins both in terms of creativity and aesthetics, recently, is only decreasing. regarding the gameplay it is not even necessary to delve into the balance of the characters strengthsabilities or something else, they removed 1 out of 2 tanks  i think this does not require further explanation, from now on, in most cases outcome of the battle depends on reinhard or another tank with a shield and if a player playing on the tank won't do his job ... in general, this is how blizzard treats their players who brought them money and support the online in their stupid games."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,hanges for the sake of changes. nothing really new or interesting at all. just overwatch 1.5 to pump money out of fans of ow1
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"overwatch 2 has shown, that at launch, gameplay wise, it is superior to its predecessor and become a more polished, balanced engaging and fun game. some aspects of of the new business model have been either questionable or simply poorly thought out, creating a early experience that left me and many others disappointed. people used the the previous business model might find what blizzard is doing offensive but lets not forget that they were not making any money on the loot box system, making that model unsustainable. some of the current pricing for some items is clearly overpriced, but the general idea of a battle pass is reasonable and health enough to keep this game going. what is wrong is locking gameplay elements behind this like heroes, this just leads to unnecessary backlash and frustration. still, as a game, overwatch 2 improved on its predecessor significantly, fixing some of the first games glaring problems. lets hope the upcoming pve truly solidifies this game as the best in its genre."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"after 2 weeks, i can say that not everything is so bad. i, as the owner of overwatch 1 since 2017, i received my skins and legacy credits. i can buy some items for legacy credits. it's cool. the really disappointment was the free battle pass rewards. in most games with battle pass we get rewards to reach every level. another disappointment was the lack of coins in the battle pass. i hope the devs will add more free rewards in the battle pass."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"absolute garbage direction for the overwatch title to move in, and a real highlighting of the greed and avarice of activision blizzard. gone are the days of being able to grind out ingame currency in a reasonable amount of time to throw down on a fun skin or accessory. now everything is locked behind the worst battle pass imaginable, or, at a minimum, almost a year of grinding for a single legendary skin. the improvements, or better to term them the changes to the title are minimal, beyond a new coat of pant and some bland new heroes. the lore has taken a massive hit, with blizzard stripping away info from the character profiles, to replace them with the absolute minimum of text, and no world building to speak of. maybe the dev's are too busy in the cosby suite to give a  fans certainly should give one about this trash fire that represents a previously engaging title's degradation spend your time on the, literally, thousands upon thousands of more worthy titles out there let this trash burn itself out. ."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"ov2 is a fun game in my opinion and iis not like i hate this game but, ive put a solid 30 hours into the game and it barely pays off. it just doesnt make sense that you need to grind to unlock heroes that were previously free. some characters are just op like zarya that has tank health but the range and damage of a dps. plus why would i need to put in my phone number to play a free game? its just outright dumb. the maps arent all that good either, if theres a sequel to a game youd expect to get new and exciting content right? but no, they just make day and night maps and even better they removed on of the best ways to obtain accessories lootboxes. now you gotta grind to get a single skin or pay 20 which is absolute . so i feel like they need to add new content and new heroes like the mecha team or members of talon into the roster. and i want this to be a good game so i hope good things will come in the foreseeable future."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"take this monetization system back, this is not my neck of the woods. game is totally unplayable now, because of battle pass. usually you're paying for battle pass, because u want to support developers and all money spent ought to be compensated via levels, but here... u gain nothing. i paid full price for ow 1 to be fcked this way? no, i can't look at what they are doing with my favourite game, but we are where we are now and i don't want to be here."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,so blizzard just basically sells you the same game you paid 60 for back in 2016 but in the way of purchasing battle pass and legendary skins for 30. two legendary skins costs as the game with all content back in 2016. this is disaster.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-17,"this game is 90 ow1 and 10 ow2, where ow1 cost 60 and ow2 with its all cosmetics costs 12 . how tf ???? it is buggy, crashes, server queue, some heroes not even balanced for new pace of the game. blizzard used to make quality games, now it seems they fired all qa and half of the dev team and hired marketing staff and as a result we got half baked addon for ow1 woth p2w and monetization. if you remove ow1 from ow2 you will hame 0 of the game and 0.3 of content. thus it is deserved 0 out of 10 p. s. and the most important part  they renamed mccree."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-16,"the positives for me orisa and dumfist reworks. negatives everything else. character reworks after which some characters are very strong and others have become very weak. certain other characters simply did not get the required changes, they still exist in another reality with different gameplay ow1. i like playing on tanks, i like the teamwork of two tanks with each other. now the tank is only 1. i absolutely do not like the new interface, before it was much better. now even worse than in paladins. judging by the interface, they want to port the game to mobile devices. the new monetization system is humiliating. p2w battle pass any paid advantage, even temporary, is a p2w. kiriko is not just an advantage in the form of a new hero, she is a strong hero. it is advantageous to make strong characters to place them in battle pass. blizzard tried to hide it by the fact that the new hero will not be available for 2 weeks in the competetive game. so you have to play 3 hours every day for two weeks to somehow try to smooth it out and still get the hero later. that's a p2w. i liked the previous gameplay better. the new gameplay is too dynamic, which makes awareness and teamwork between players noticeably less. usually gameplay now looks like chaos with little to no interaction. even ranked matches now look like deathmatch. i've noticed that now, at the end of a match, sometimes players who have spent many hours in ow1 don't even realize whether they've won or lost until the game informs them with victorydefeat. some new maps are bad in terms of game balance between the two teams. i don't like the new lighting on the maps, especially on the kings row and busan. the past lighting was better. the new lighting looks flat and cheap, like a mobile game. they changed the interface and lighting on the maps for the sake of mimicking the changes, but they did it poorly.. the new character icons are designed for a zoomer audience. i would have liked to stay in overwatch 1, but for obvious reasons, blizzard didn't want to risk leaving the choice to the players understanding the quality of overwatch 2. i buy a game and was deprived of a choice, blizzard made the choice instead of me. it was the same with warcraft. i do not welcome this attitude towards the players. new developers don't value their core audience, now they're targeting fortnite and valorant. also, the game constantly closes without errors. it has been two weeks of communication with technical support. my game still just closes without errors. after 6 days of waiting i get the answer unfortunately, due to a technical problem, all the attachments were removed before i opened your request. please duplicate it. thank you in advance! 1200 hours and 3600 max rating"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-16,the same as the first game but with some improvements. a waste of time and bad service online.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-16,"overwatch 2 is a terribly done game which i find funny since its pretty much overwatch 1 but not by much, it had a rocky launch but that does not affect the overall quality of the game but what does is the horrible balancing and unnecessary changesadditions blizzard has done to each role. almost every single tank is now too op, specifically orisa and she was fine back in ow1 so i dont get the change. dps heroes like gengi are a bit broken now, pharah surprisingly has been known to be way more infuriating now and a lot of people can say just get good or whatever, pharah is the only hero in the entire game to be able to fly freely. heroes like  and echo can fly too but not as passively like pharah does and the amount of damage pharah deals is ridiculous to the point it is super easy for the player to get a solo team kill just as pharah alone with her ultimate, i never seen or had that happen back in ow1 yet here she is now broken. other heroes i can name would be moira and doomfist, doomfist becoming a tank is now more annoying due to the additional health he receives as a tank and the additional ability being able to block attacks receiving no damage whatsoever which clearly isnt more annoying enough  doomfist player can practically zoom past everyone in the map using his abilities alone whilst completing decimating everyone and moira as a support hero is fine, only issue is i think blizzard needs to tune down how much damage she deals now through her primary weapon and either nerf or remove her biotic orbs since the vast majority of players will be using moira as a third dps hero rather than an actual support making it. so many games i have played as my favourite dps and support heroes i have gotten my health from 200 completely destroyed to 0 just by her orbs alone, the fact i write this annoys me slightly more knowing that blizzard already is acting so ignorant and refuses to do more hero balancing until the start of season 2. meaning as of the time i write this, we have 50 more days according to the battle pass before we get actual correct balancing in the game to have it at least more enjoyable and not have players in a fit of rage against these broken heroes, this game can definitely be good and i would love to see overwatch 2 succeed but right now it is hard to see this, if it were not for the battle pass and the very first mythic skin in this game, i would not play this until season 2. blizzard to me is very incompetent and ignorant, not sure if i can they are these things since the beginning or since they have been activision blizzard, my personal recommendation to anyone reading this, if you are considering on playing this game please wait until season 2, if you will find the same heroes as i mentioned to be as infuriating to play against then be sure to realise blizzard will not do anything until season 2 begins"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-16,"we had a b2p fun game with decent ingame rewards and no pressure about how much time do you have to spend grinding. now it's a huge downgrade with insane prices and even buying battlepass  you are forced to grind 3040 min  day completing daily achievements. bp rewards are mediocre at best . feels more like a chore than a game now. not recommended, save your time."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-16,"shame on you blizzard. we paid the full price to get the full game, characters and skins included. and now, you turn it into a freetoplay where characters are locked unless you grind, where previously ingame currency acquirable skins are now only obtainable by paying 20 half the price of overwatch!!! or by grinding every challenges for 8 months to get a single yellow skin, and with all of that, not even an excuse to the players who kept this game alive. you could have at least given the price people paid for overwatch in payable currency overwatch coin, that's the least you could have done. and i'm not even talking about reimbursing the game here. i kept it polite in this comment, but trust me activisionblizzard, my heart is a lot less polite than what i wrote. i was considering coming back to the game i enjoyed so much. never again. never am i gonna buy or play anything from you again. shame on you for disrespecting your players. shame on you. simply disgusting."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-16,"i was an avid player of overwatch 1 for five years. i cannot overstate how underwhelming i find overwatch 2 in comparison to its predecessor. overwatch 1 was a game that relied on a complex fusion of character, strategy, and skill. and this was, for me, its selling point. this is what set it apart from other games. there are many shooters out there, many of which have been more successful than overwatch 1, but none of them had that same amalgamation of qualities. this set overwatch up as a very niche game. overwatch 2 is much closer to the other shooters out there. its focus is on speed and dynamism. this may sound good on paper. in practice, however, it makes the gameplay very samey. each match is a five minute series of slugfests in which damage is dully traded back and forth until one side suddenly manages to pick off a couple more targets than the other and steamrolls through the engagement. the feeling of strategy is gone. the feeling that a good play on your part could swing the engagement in your favor is gone. it all feels very... random and empty. there's nothing satisfying about winning or frustrating about losing. there's no tension. this feeling that something is missing is exacerbated by the changes made to the heroes. they still have their personalities, but the watered down skills make them feel less impactfulless distinct. heroes feel much more fungible. unlike overwatch 1, i haven't felt that my choice of hero has been that meaningful in overwatch 2. this robs the game of that key component that the unique heroes brought to the original. now the choice of hero feels more cosmetic than strategic. the heroes have life only in their voicelines. you don't feel anything about them from their gameplay. it feels more like paladins than overwatch. in fact, the game feels like paladins in other ways as well. both games have a large cast of samey heroes to play. both games often devolve into chaotic brawls with little or no strategy. and both games feel very cheap. in overwatch 2, everything feels less polished. the new particle effects often look tacky. some of the new sound effects are weak e.g. the strange sound that plays every time you get a kill as hanzo. and the new, sped up orisa looks like someone is playing a recording on fast forwardit's very much in the uncanny valley. the last point i want to touch on is the weird overhaul of the game's ui. the original overwatch gave the players tons of info about the match. it was easy to track kills, and the post match scoreboard helped you see how you and your teammates had done. now it's difficult to know who is pulling their weight and who isn't. matches just show a play of the game and end. there are no endorsements at least not as they existed in ow1, no voting for best player. the game just rushes you off to another match. it really takes the social aspect out of the game. win or lose, i always used to type good game in the chat at the end and compliment any outstanding players i had noticed. in overwatch 2, i don't feel any impetus to do this since the matches feel so random and the game ushers you out so quickly. there are countless other little points i could bring up, but those are the main failings of the game in my opinion the general lack of impact in the gameplay and hero selection, the cheap feel of the game, and the minimal social elements. all of these make the game feel like a pale shadow of its predecessor. i feel like paladins 2 would have been a more apt title. interestingly, i've seen lots of posts from players who like the game better this way, but again, that's probably because the original had a particular niche that it filled and filled very well, whereas overwatch 2 is clearly aimed at mass market appeal. i understand why blizzard would prefer to target a broader audience, but it's disappointing that they would do so by replacing an existing property that had a dedicated niche. it's possible that the new game would grow on me if i played it more. maybe i'd find more strategy than it initially appears to have. however, at this point i just get so bored when playing it that i can't see myself dedicating enough time to the game for this to happen. i've already uninstalled it as i can never bring myself to actually boot it up anymore. for all overwatch 1's faults, it was never dull. i cannot say the same about overwatch 2, and that's a pretty damning weakness for a shooter. overall 410. cannot recommend."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-15,"this review saddens me to write, however, blizzard has completely dropped the ball on this game. i have logged thousands of hours on overwatch and its safe to say there is no difference between the 2 games. and for that reason for someone like me who played so much there's nothing here for me to keep me playing or to desire. the graphics are better but the new character sojourn is unfair and broken, the new maps aren't great and there seems to be much imbalance. i will not be playing this dud  much longer. they took of medals and the award screen, theres no  of the best games ever made has been ruined by a poor release of a 2nd version."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-15,"people are often lined up in matches that are already about to lose, and if they want to quit, they will also be punished, which makes people very unhappy."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-15,"i came into this with an open mind and as a fan of the previous game. it is the previous game only transparently more money hungry, so bad that they make loot boxes look ethical. the loss of medals and statistics at the end of a match are just boring. no chance to see if and how well you did. in short garbage cash grab that ruined a good game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-14,"blizzards new addition to their roster of starstudded games overwatch 2 arrived on pc, playstation 45, xbox oneseries x, and nintendo switch on october 4th, 2022, after multiple delays. however, with a disastrous launch where dedicated fans of the blizzard ip waited in fortythousandplayer queues signs pointed to a lessthanpromising game awaiting players. luckily overwatch 2 still packs the punch the series always possessed with graphics reminiscent of your favorite pixar movie and tactical gameplay which requires coordination from you and your teammates, though this game severely lacks enough content to warrant a sequel. a staple of overwatchs branding was its graphics. unlike most games in the firstperson shooter scene, overwatch 2016 didnt rely on the realistic grit found in teambased shooters such as counterstrike global offensive 2012 and rainbow six siege 2015 rather blizzard built overwatch 2016 with graphics that had a level of polish similar to disneys pixar movies. not much has changed in this department with its sequel sticking to a similar art style that seems to have a deeper level of detail due to the strides pc and console gaming have taken when it comes to processing power. beautiful landscapes are fully explorable and are complimented by the upgraded engine overwatch 2 runs on with most maps returning from overwatch 2016. this is where the first red herring arises from the sequel. overwatch 2 suffers from a lack of content. overwatch 2016 launched with twentyone playable heroes and twelve maps to play on which overwatch 2 launches with all the content of overwatch 2016 but only offers three new heroes and eight new maps with the change in content meant to be excused by the games price tag which happens to be free. while the addition of new heroes and maps seems to be well thought out and balanced, the offered content is more in line with the updates overwatch 2016 used to get. every few months a new heromap or even both were added to the first game before overwatch 2s announcement in 2019. a plus is that overwatch 2 has already announced a plethora of content to come to the platform in the following months, but this doesnt excuse a less pleasing launch for the sequel that was originally slated for a 2020 release. another problem this game has is the change in its service model. now that overwatch 2 is technically free to play blizzard has locked all the skins from overwatch 2016 and newly added skins behind ridiculous paywalls with skins being upwards of usd 15 in most cases. this is a stark contrast to the original games where ingame items could be earned by merely playing the game and completing challenges. the original title was a 60 game however with content being added every few months it was worth every single penny. locking the only earnable content behind a paywall is only harmful to the pa games possible success, especially if it alienates new players and old players alike. as per usual the highlight of the game is its gameplay. this is perhaps the biggest change as overwatch 2 now hosts five versus five objectivebased battles rather than the original six versus six. now teams are formatted with one tank, two healers, and, two damage characters which has changed how enemy engagement happens within the game. with the sequel, the single tank now leads the team with more health and the ability to punish damage and healer opposition easier in comparison to teams being led by two softer tanks in overwatch 2016. damage characters have now been optimized and updated accordingly to be more aggressive and dish out, even more, kills than in the original game. healers have always been a point of controversy in the world of overwatch 2016 however other than a couple of characters such as lucio and zenyatta who dont do enough healing characters now sport passive abilities which allow them to have a higher chance of survivability in the sequel. the biggest overhaul comes in one fell swoop with not as many tanks sporting shields to protect their team and most abilities which stunned characters being removed from the game to improve engagement and make the game overall a more aggressive experience. overwatch 2 seems to be headed in the right direction in terms of gameplay and free heromap content which is great considering this was a big selling point of its predecessor. however, this does not excuse the predatory freetoplay model which locks content previously added to the game and cosmetic items which are planned to be added in the foreseeable future. this paired with an underwhelming launch in comparison to overwatch 2016 makes this an underbaked sequel with a lot of potential."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-14,"i can say with absolute sincerity that overwatch 2 is terrible. it's one of the worst games i've ever played. the characters are generic and ineffectual, the matches are either a complete steamroll with you either instantly winning or losing with zero inbetween, and the graphics make it look like it came out more than a decade ago. blizzard has taken content out of the game and added utterly insulting microtransactions. it's appalling, honestly. eight months to unlock a single skin, several years to unlock everything on one character. a battle pass that locks playable characters behind it. and to top it all off, the video game that i purchased with my own money has been completely removed and i cannot access it, anymore. if i ever wanted to boot up overwatch again, i would have to settle for walmart great value version that blizzard is calling a sequel. first, they took one of my childhood games from me, removed it from existence, and replaced it with a broken mess. warcraft iii was only the first sacrifice. i have uninstalled all blizzard games and will not be giving them money, from here on out. i have boycotted the demonic entity that is wearing blizzard's face. i highly suggest everyone do the same so we can finally shut down this monstrosity."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"i am an overwatch 1 player with over 2000 hours of gameplay. it's amazing how blizzard released overwatch 2 all broken, with fps drops, stuttering and other problems. the game today is unbearable for low and midrange pcs. with the first overwatch you could play it very smoothly with graphics cards up to the gtx750 ti class. overwatch 1 was very well optimized and running smoothly. i have a pc with cpu intel core i5 10400  2.90ghz ram 16.0gb dualchannel ddr4 board gigabyte technology co. ltd. b460 hd3 card asus vp228 1920x108060hz 2047mbnvidia geforce gtx 1660 super disk 232gb samsung ssd 860 evo 250gb sata ssd with this pc i played overwatch 1 even in epic quality without fps drops. with overwatch 2 the fps drops to 50 every so often, sometimes it drops to 37 fps... the game is very poorly optimized. the worst thing is that the support forums do not help you and do not give you a solution. the launch of this second part has been a disaster of epic proportions."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"the game is very unfortunately underdeveloped. the game, known for its 6 player fps game, move to 5. it's leaving us to force another person to kick out of the group to queue. the game is also poorly balanced, as much as it was in overwatch 1. overwatch 2 does not create any new innovative mechanics or gameplay. i do realize they made the game free, which helped expand the player base which was nice. however, it was so far away from my imagination. the game uses a battle pass system which is much worse, and can not say anything about it because they have done cod warzone battle pass, and have knowledge in battle passes, which is why i was very disappointed in overwatch 2's battle pass. the new characters they introduced were very lackluster, and the changes they made to their original cast of playable characters was very frustrating. one of the biggest controversial changes is the change of cassidy's flash grenade into a regular grenade. the changes they implemented kept the strong characters relatively strong, such as the frustrating genji and hanzo, along with reinhardt's massive and very durable shield."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"at the time i purchased overwatch 2, i had not played the original game since it first came out and so of course i figured i'd load up the tutorial for a refresher i was met with an endless loading screen. 'no matter,' i thought, i could just try the practice range instead endless loading screen. a little frustrated but undeterred, i then go to the vs ai mode since at least i could reacclimate myself against bots instead of real people. the queue time itself was short but as soon as it had found a game, it just lead to another endless loading screen. this time with a little notification in the bottom left taunting me with 'error starting game, trying again.' finally, i relented, and went to quick play  prepared to have my ass handed to me by teenagers the entire game  but no, what was waiting for me was even worse. 'error starting game, trying again.' this is all to say that, for me, overwatch 2 was not a game. it was a menu and a loading screen. even indie games lovingly crafted by but a single hand can't get away with this level of nonfunctionality. but from a gratuitous cashgrab sequel from an equally gratuitous aaa developer and publisher like blizzard entertainment it is appalling. edit i was able to find a way to fix the issue by fiddling with my drivers and repeatedly scanning  repairing my game files so it's at least playable now. my issue with it still stands though as the player community shouldn't have to fix their game for them. anyway, i've updated my score from a 0 to a 4 in light of these developments and since the core game itself is still fun and enjoyable. the problem is that it's not a new game it just feels like the same overwatch with a few new faces. i can't  in good faith  give it anything less than a 4 because as i said the core gameplay of overwatch is still excellent, but i also can't give it anything more than a 4 because there is nothing new within the game that i feel could justify the '2' in the title."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,it's the biggest scam to put new heroes into a battle pass. they can't fix a single bug but manage to add new ones. 0 matchmaking balance you get people in ranked that never played the game before and are able to play the most important role just to make it impossible for you to win. queue times feel like the games is 10 years old already. who would have guessed that blizzard would release a decent game after the biggest fail with diablo immortal. 3 or more characters are disabled for ranked because blizzard know nothing about balance in a game or how to fix beyond broken bugs. you need 8 month of daily 2 hours or more grind to get a single skin. after the launch i regret to have bought overwatch 1 in the first place. so many games are free to play with out those  systems if i could i would take back every single penny i ever gave to blizzard... can't wait to see how many cash grab systems they add to diablo 4. the only positive thing was the change from 2 tanks to 1 but now you just insta loose with a bad tank

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"i didn't play o1, but when i turned on o2 to test, i was surprised very positively. of course, the comparison to paladins comes to mind, in which i have lost many hours. if the graphics were omitted, when they resemble each other 1 1, hence my surprise that this game was not f2p from the beginning. there are some differences to the gameplay, e.g. there are no items to buy during the match, but the game modes and overall gameplay are downright 1 1. many characters resemble in some way, some only in appearance, some only in abilities, some in both. i got bored of paladins years ago, and overwatch is like playing something familiar, but a little different. looking at the o1 to o2 comparisons, it's not so much to compare, it's the same game with a big update  as i saw on youtube. it would be better to compare it to paladins, as if overwatch was like what i would imagine paladins 2 as graphically definitely outperforms paladins. the gameplay itself is nice, but i miss the card deck system that was in paladins and allowed me to customize my character. people with flying inara aka flynara know what i mean. it made paladins a bit more unpredictable. this is sorely lacking in o2. i had been playing for about 34 days and i had no problem with the game, only today there was a problem with finding a match, the game was constantly communicating to me about some error. searching for a match takes 10 minutes. yesterday and the day before yesterday even at 5 am i found matches in a minute. this is some kind of error with the servers  i guess. the characters are actually interesting, but i miss the attacking and flanking division that exists in paladins. some characters are asking to be attackers and others to be flankers. i think that there are definitely too few supports and tanks, and there are probably 3 times more attackers than supports and tanks combined. this is ridiculous. the game has potential, but the developers have to try harder to diversify the game with, for example, decks of cards, but is this enough to keep the player for longer, since the same thing is still being done? this is the problem of all fps games. you only walk and shoot really. you get bored with one game, i got bored with everyone. o2 pulled me in for now, but we'll see for how long. maybe a week, maybe a month. like most games of this type. they quickly get bored when there is no plot and an interesting world to explore. interesting stories never get bored, gameplay is the first thing that gets boring in games. so that's a problem for all games that only have gameplay. but 710 is very good game. mostly i give 510, never 1010, because 1010 is godlike game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,i hope taking a patch and just calling it a sequel  game 2 doesn't become a normal thing. this is the same damn game this is not a sequel. i've seen games get bigger regular patch updates. many of the changes actually make the game worse. it's such a tragedy how low blizzard has fallen since their early days.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,blizzard fixed none of the issues except 1 and created a whole load of new ones. the tank meta is gone due to enforcing roles. due to this the queue times are again long and the matches still not fun. gg blizzard you rereleased a dying game by slapping a 2 on
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"excluding a tank from matches made the game faster and cooler to play however, now it has turned into an absurd slot machine, before it was possible to play and buy skins peacefully with the money that i won playing the games, now the skins are extremely expensive because the amount of coins that can be obtained is negligible compared to the price of same... basically 1 year doing the weekly missions to buy a single skin, ridiculous"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"hay que tener huevos para esto. para empezar lo llaman juego nuevo cuando aaden 3 personajes, uno de los cuales no puedas jugar a menos que pagues o tengas el juego de antes. adems parece que el cliente lo programaron 2 monos con progeria ya que multitud de personas han perdido sus cuentas yo incluido, adems tambin se dan casos de que el servidor falla constantemente incluso en rankeds que para la gente tryhard le arruina su experiencia de juego. por cierto cambian personajes como sombra o briggite para que el juego sea mas activo y frentico pero a doomfist lo convierten en un tanque y le quitan su movilidad cuando estoy seguro de que nadie se quejaba tanto de el como de phara que con su mecnica de volar vuelve intiles a la gran mayora de personajes del juego obligando al equipo a ponerse personajes como soldado 76 o cassidy todos sabemos que es mcree renunciando a cualquier posibilidad de poder ganarle solo con tu habilidad. en conclusion el juego es basura y solo jugamos porque tenamos buenos recuerdos de nuestra infancia solo para que nos salgan con esta mierda destinada nicamente a sacar dinero con el mnimo esfuerzo."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"the game does bring some new mechanics and playability but over all it just feels like an ow1 port. the creators made the game a mtx cash grab that leaves its players empty with any feeling of progression in the game. levels, metals at the end of the game, and cards cards have all been replaced with a lackluster ui... hopefully some of these issues get fixed but i know the group i play with wont be coming back to the game any time soon. sad to see a once staple in gaming stoop to this level of neglect. the potential is there, it just doesn't live up to the expectations a lot of us have for franchise."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,they wanted to lock out people without phone plans cause they're not gonna be people with disposable cash so who needs em
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"the horrible launch of this game was one thing, but the monetization and removal of previously existing content were the two things that really made me hate this game. i loved overwatch 1 a whole lot. i put like 500 hours into it, and i dont see myself putting any more than 3 hours in ow2 until they change the monetization and add back some of the iconic maps that are gone now. my biggest issue is definitely the monetization, since the game charges you a whole 12,000 for all the content that could be unlocked for free in overwatch 1. it also requires you to grind more than 50 total wins per week sometimes in order to complete all the weekly challenges, which only nets you a total of 60 coins. thats enough to get one legendary skin if you grind consecutively for 32 weeks.  that. it totally puts me off of this game that i once loved because now i cant even unlock new  without shilling out tons and tons of money to a company already worth 68.7 billion dollars. i dont like this game at all. i miss overwatch 1."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"i'm sorry this game does not deserve 1.5 stars, usually i'm with the community on these divisive game choices but not here. the monetization needs to be improved yes, and the game is a bit buggy. but the gameplay is so addicting and the removal of that 6 player is so game changing that it honestly boosts the game way above it faults. haters gonna hate, this game is awesome."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"i payed for ow1, and they took away the game i paid for. i really loved to earn multiple chests per day in ow1, and now in ow2 they removed that. to earn 1 single legendary skin yo need to complete weekly missions for 3 months to earn enough coins to buy it. the battle pass has 80 levels, 10 free by leveling it up and 70 paid, but you need to complete the 80 levels to earn the 10 free rewards and 0 of the other 70. wtf are you doing to overwatch blizzard?. of course they are gonna remove overwatch 1 and instead replace it for overwatch 2. who the fck would play ow2 otherwise?."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"one of the most annoying, chaotic and obnoxious games i've played so far. massive downgrade."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"to call this overwatch 2 is a joke. it's a patch, minus content we should have recieved, minus content that should be in the game allready. with crazy predatory monetization. to begin with, several maps from ow1 is missing. numbani, blizzard world, hanamura, havana and several others. nor did they fix the paris map how long have they promised that? or the lunar horizon colony. they didn't even balance the new healer until launch, so kiriko is not even playable in competitive. there is no single player gameplay as they promised us so many times either. what we did get though, is a  cashgrab shop. and not just any shop, an absolute joke of a monetization system. gone are the days when you could earn things by playing. now you have to buy stuff for your real money and not just legendary skins. everything. voice lines, poses. everything is locked behind a paywall. gone as well, are the days where you could look forward to the season shift and get some cool new skins for that season. i guess it would have been ok if there was some way to earn these items in game as well, but there isn't. apart from a weekly challange that would take you 8 months to get one skin, there is nothing. not but for you to take up your wallet and pay absurd amounts of money for a digital graphic item they slapped together in a few days. in ow1 you could get 2 legendary skins in a day if you were lucky and to that, add several voice lines, sprays and poses. now they demand 20 dollars no i'm not joking...lmao, 20 dollars for one skin. what about the battlepass then? well, not even the battlepass they could let be a reward for loyal players of the game. first off all, it takes an insane amount of games to level up to get anyting worth your while, most people don't have that kind of time. so why did they do this? well, because of course, you shouldn't be awarded for actually playing the game, no.. you should be awarded for paying them with real money to not play the game so you can just pass the battlepass and get the items inside it anyway. yes they really did this. it's not a joke. and even if you do decide to do the long grind with the battlepass you will have the exact same skins, voicelines and everything else as everyone else. how fun is that? personalitzation  gone. the battlepass is of course deliberately made to be very slow to level up as well, so after you grinded for 2 months, but didn't have the time to reach all the way to the skin you would have wanted, you will pay anyway to feel that all of that grind towards the item you wanted isn't in vain. basically they just pissing in the face of their players. they release a half arsed patch with a new  monetization system to earn more cash and slap ow 2 on it. remove a lot of features people liked you cannot even see which team you met last game now, or the ranks of players and add a couple of maps and call it a day. it's not enough allready with the insane amount of money they've earned from overwatch lootboxes an insane amount and game sales, no no... they have to sqeeze out more money from every player. especially if you are young and don't understand the system. that's the new blizzard for you, where every good dev that was the real blizzard has left the company a long time ago and left is a shell with predatory monetization and greed. so to leave with some good things with ow2 the new remakes of orisa and bastion are pretty good. the new heroes are fun but all of them are girls for some reason but not because it's something special, just because they are new and we are starved of content since they just didn't give a  about the ow community for several years. releasing only three new heroes, when they haven't released anything in such a long time is weak. same goes with the maps. it's fun with something new. but that should have allready been in the game a long time ago. other than that there isn't much else. everything is pretty much the same or worse. the graphic update is very meh. in my opinion several heroes even looked better before. so that's overwatch 2 for you. pay up like a good boy, so bobby can get a bigger yacht, a third sportscar and a larger barmitzva party for his son. ps, don't let anybody fool you this has anything to do with covering costs. it doesn't. ds."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"honestly, i do not even want to lose my time for this game. for a company like activisionblizzard , this game is a shame. it do not deserve the 2, regarding the ridiculous amount of modifications. a little example of this awesome  7 games, 7 leaves in a row 5 directly, so game is aborted and 2, just after the time allowing to abord the game. we can remember that this game is supposed to be a competitive one. blizzard ? shame on you."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"this game is called a sequel, but it rather is a downgrade at most. i mean the 5v5 is kinda fun to play as a dps you actually feel like you can do something, but thats about it. the role of a healer has become exponentially harder and tank just doesnt feel as good anymore because the synergy is missing. the large amount of barriers got replaced by other massive visual effects like kirikos ultimate or sojourns e ability. besides the gameplay changes there is literally nothing good in this game. matches feel unrewarding, the ranked system is really broken as you literally meet literally all kinds of elo in the lowest rank tiers. overall you cant really understand how you have improved in your rank after each game, making ranked really boring and unrewarding as well. since dps make a lot more impact now, simple mistakes that wouldnt really punished in ow1 will get you killed now. this isnt really a big issue, but its still frustrating. in case of ui and qol features, there arent any of these in the game anymore. the ui is literally garbage and looks like there was no one that tested it for any longer than 5 minutes. also many of the qol and social features that made ow1 really rewarding and fun were removed, making this game feel really empty. theres literally nothing after your game, you just queue up for another game. also the monetization of the game is so bad and expensive. you gain such little amounts of credits that you have to grind for months to get a legendary skin. ow1 was better in almost anything you can clearly argue about the gameplay."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,"thanks blizzard for giving us freetoplay trash, that we saw 6 years ago. nothing have changed, but now we have to pay for everything. only 3 new heroes, some maps and battle pass that has nothing interesting. and what blizzard can say about features that were showed in gameplay trailers? i think, nothing. this game is still overwatch 1 but for every step you have to pay."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-13,just a horrible horrible game. overwatch 1 was fun but they ruined it and took away the game i loved. big middle finger to all who contributed to the terrible title. shame on you.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,a joke. overwatch was already enough for us. we don't want to be forced to play the update.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,worst blizzard game i have ever played in my life. just another freetoplay garbage. there is a chance that you will not be able to play because servers are bad. not recomended
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"overwatch 2 pales in comparison to overwatch 1. ow2 is a marketing scam to try to get more money. the battle pass is stupid pay money to get a fearofmissingout job to play and earn access to skins. you lose access to several maps. the rework of visuals makes it much harder to tell where your enemies are attacking from. in the future, new characters are going to be locked behind this paywall, count me out. i honestly wanted to like this game, but it feels like the fun was  out of as activisionblizzard squeezes every cent they can out of the players."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i'm in shock in just how much of a downgrade overwatch 2 is from its predecessor, they removed everything that made overwatch unique. i could go on and on but too cut it short. the greediness of overwatch 2 is mind boggling and i'm disgusted how overwatch has performed in just this week alone!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,". . .   ,    ,  , ,   ?   ,   hd.      ,         ,        .  ,         f2p"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"takes away the original game and replaces it for a cashgrab that only diablo immoral would be proud of, skins you could get for free in lootboxes which you could also get for free by just playing are now worth 20, the battlepass is mediocre at best and it doesnt even gives you enough premium currency to buy next battlepasses like many games on the market"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i've never played overwatch 1 but my friends were always praising this game so when i heard overwatch 2 was free i got interested to download and play it but it wants me to give them my phone number and i'm never gonna support such practices. in the end i did not give them the number, guess i'm never gonna play this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"so it's overwatch 1 but worse, blizzard only made some rebalancing on some heroes, add some map and 3 heroes and some skin and a batlle pass and a lot of bugs but they especially dared to take away a lot of features that overwatch 1 had no more medal, no more on fire system, no more leveling system, no more way to get skins or emotes or even tag for free and so on ...."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"sad stuff actually. they made and excuse for a second game by saying it will have pve, well it doesn't. was really looking forward for the pve. if you don't have it for the launch then why even launch they game? oh the greed! if you were lucky to play the first a lot and have a lot of cosmetics that will be good, otherwise, with the new battle pass and coin farm it will be impossible, it feels like overwatch 1.5, why call it overwatch 2? ah yeah, they need money. i think kaplan left as soon as he found out what will they do, because he said o1 won't have paid dlcs. so they went out of their way, to keep that promise real. pretty sure the new heroes and maps were already in development in og overwatch but they had to halt to keep it for second. i played around 2300h in overwatch, and overwatch 2 is a joke . blizzard keeps digging its own grave."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"couldnt get more soulless than valorant at this point, genuinely sad to see the sequel banner being used on a crappy repaint of a dead game just to shill out more garbage for people to give money into with little to no satisfaction"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"jogo  a mesma coisa do overwatch 1, s que de graa. quem comprou overwatch 1, no ganhou nada a mais... a loja do jogo  horrivel, tudo caro, passe de batalha  caro, no da pra ganhar caixa jogando o jogo. progresso muito ruim battle pass. gastei r120 no overwatch 1 para retirarem o jogo e no conseguir pegar as skins antigas. jogo lixo."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"omg i gave away ow1 to some kid. now i remeber why. battlepass , balance , healers are necessary and they all suk. ow2 is ow1 and it"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"all of the ui changes and audio changes are awful. why remove ways to find groups? why remove medals to reward you for good play? did they remove medals to avoid toxicity? no, they did not. now, instead, they show everyone's healing, damage, and mitigation, which easily shows you who is leading and who is lacking on your team and the enemy team. gameplay feels faster, but there is little no teamwork or cohesion yet. playing supports who have little defensemovement is a death sentence with how much the enemies go to your backlines while your tank is across the map. this is all without mentioning the monetization, which is outright egregious. 20 for a skin? i can get 3 skins for the whole price of ow1? corporate greed is a plague upon the gaming industry. battle passes already feel outdated, relying so heavily on fomo. paying for products you may not even receive, and with how slowly you gain xp, it is very likely."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"feels somewhat like overwatch but i am really disappointed with all the bugs at launch and the horrid ranking system. i am playing with people who have never played before, ever, because they put me in bronze 5 when in the same category i was gold, almost plat. super frustrating. and now that ranking is not good, no one cares about it. i had 5 games in a row with someone who left the game. they don't care because ranking is a joke. overwatch was my absolute favorite game of all time i loved climbing the ranks and have never put so many hours into the game. now i can't stand to play for than an hour before it's too much and i get off. i miss ow1 and hope they bring it back, or fix this mess . it also disconnects me from blizzard everything i get an xbox achievement then suspends me when they are the ones with the bug. crazy."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"ow2 is literally the same game with updated graphics and ui. battle pass is a toxic cash grab, requiring a phone number is absolutely ridiculous. ranked play is a hot garbage fire of a mode and their ranking system is a joke. this game should've never been made in the first place."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i am outraged by the amount of bad games that are coming out between 2019,2020,2021,2022 and a lot of bad crap! good game is rarely coming out. this one of them. there are some moments that i had to stand in a queue with 2000 people in front of me"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"bunch of unfulfilled promises and not a sequel. you no longer can farm loot boxes which were pretty fun for me. now you have a battle pass and it takes unreasonably long to get anything. and overall it feels like a step down in some features, it just feels more empty and stripped game so it is more like overwatch 0,6."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,garbage imbalanced game for kids. imagine unironically playing this seriously. i'd rather be a pro at tictactoe than this.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,a 21 gigabyte update that somehow makes the game so much worse. not worth the pricetag and its  free.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"this is just straight up a down grade from overwatch 1, the 5v5 feels nice but this is something that could have easily been put into ow1"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"its terrible  you, blizzard"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"this is a direct downgrade from the previous title. nothing changed, most of things just got paywalled."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"without long introductions. 1 fierce donat. if there used to be a paid game, now it is only visible for free. if you want cool skins, pay money. do you want it for free? play 247. why were the loot boxes removed? they were perfect. 2 5x5. and why was it impossible to introduce a separate mode for fans of this option? 3 inclusivity. i still can't forgive blizzard for the soldier. why is it in the game? no, i don't really care, but blizzard emphasizes it so much that i want to puke. 4 separate tournaments for inclusive? i feel slighted. no but i can say it, why is it in the game?i have already asked this question 5 linking to the phone? what the  oh, that's it. not a foot in the game anymore. 6 departures from the game. i'm sure it will be fixed, but i left the negative."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,nunca gostei da activision blizzard sempre odiei eles e sempre tive preconceito com jogos da blizzard e evitei por anos o overwatch 1 porem eu gosto de testa jogos free to play e resolvi da uma chance para o overwatch 2 e eu me surpreendi e me apaixonei pelo jogo ele  muito bom s teve uns pequenos problemas no lanamento mais j ta estabilizando  um dos melhores fps que existe e o melhor fps grtis humilhando todos os outros fps gratuitos porem o jogo ta sofrendo com muito ataque de fake news por parte de haters e sonystas radicais
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,this game was made free for a reason cause the changes are so bad that i'm sure activision blizzard knew it would piss off long time fans. most characters have been nerfed or just completely altered the maps are the same just at a different time of day. not to mention the bs fortnite progression system i've played this game since it was on beta and for the first few years it was amazing now i deleted this game from my hard drive after 3 games
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"unrewarding, grindy, unfair, paywall. that what's you are in to do in ow2. is not fun and has a horrible matchmaking."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,this game is a sham of its former self and an obvious cash grab from a faltering company.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"game is gratebut buggy!, but monetization and joy of progressing is awful, they have cod and hs, why not just copy monetization from there?.. also, i honestly think blizzard pissed in mouth of every ow1 user. still bought battlepass because i'm blizzard little beatch. sorry brothers and sisters, i let you down."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"jeu que j'avais achet et qui est devenu payant et du coup plus dutout attractif , quelle dception !"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i don't understand why there is a huge negative, most likely just review bombed. it's alright, overwatch 2 is still the same overwatch. patiently waiting for the pve content, pvp is fun while you aren't up against stacking try hard players, as overwatch is pretty well known for this."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,the new progression system is designed to hold users over the barrel. game is just a cash grab and it shows. all this drama so they could add 3 heroes and call it a new game. what a joke.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,activision blizzard strikes again they just can't seem to stop taking the l's.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"what a pile of trash, i loved overwatch but they have destroyed it, they should have made this seperatly and sold it just to thier paypags, the fact we are all forced to play this trash is crazy"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,gameplay is amazing.. just hope you want to open your wallet for any piece of content. skin? 20 dollars. a freaking voice line? 5 dollars. want to do it for free? play for 8 months straight and get a single skin.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"its overwatch, but way better. also pve coming next year, so this isnt even all of it"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"dude there's a lot of bugs going on, i get an achievement on xbox series s and out of nowhere the game leaves the game, and i play ranked man i was banned for that for 1 season, and when it's not that the server crashes, seriously reset it and release the ranked to general because it's not our fault"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,espero que eles ouam a comunidade se no quiserem que o jogo seja esquecido...

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,perfect way to ruin overwatch 1 just another f2p game with grinding battle pass and expansive microtransactions.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"sms protect. monetization. orisa. soldier. moira. dont have to say much more. game . healing is useless, tanks are dps and so on. everything is unbalanced, half the roster has a oneshot. very cool"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i had the chance to try the game during the beta and again during the previous days. i'm not saying i'm disappointed, but i expected something else, i expected more change. in short i expected more potatoes for the release of this game which was sold as a new game, almost an illumination. in the end it's just overwatch 1 with a big update. you have to tell me the interest of releasing an episode 2 just to add graphic changes and the means of being able to ping, whereas the ping should have been added in the 1. in the end i am impatiently awaiting the coop mode but for me the rest of the game stayed the same the flavor of the game is bland and adding a battle pass won't make me play more, the magic is long gone."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"all time queues. after buggs, laggs, disconncts. gameplay was changed, but it is so bore."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,thank you blizzard for create a good game u don't deserve a 1 you deserve a 9 i played ur game since 2017 and he still good and fun to play

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i give it a 1 out of 10 because  compared to reforged  it's still a good game. but replacing the original, taking away stuff from the game  it's pretty much the same . also hiding ingame stuff behind insane paywalls and battle passes. nope. completely devalues the whole game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"monetization, is some of the scummiest in all of gaming, no progression, no point to play more than a week"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,5 vs 5 what was the point? this has fundamentally made every match feel like a team deathmatch. tanks now do the most damage as they're constantly healed by the supports and only one of them. some heroes no longer make any sense like zarya without another tank its ruined how she was. thanks for making us wait that long for and it being completely awful blizzard
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"its just a dlc for overwatch 1 and game is free to play so why so bad opinions. it's just not overwatch 2, srsly they added 3 heroes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"thank you blizzard for making the game less boring and more competitive. the graphic overhaul is beautiful, the new heroes are amazing. too bad for the start of the game but you are forgiven. when i tasted the beta the first time, i found the 1 totally boring."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"n i can play this game free, thanks blizzard and fix server plz, just fix sver"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"the new iteration of overwatch feels stripped down, we lost maps, options, game modes, and anything in game telling you that you are doing well. we gained very little. the graphics are the same, but the rewards for playing are almost nothing. everything is behind a very weird pay wall, and the rewards for paying aren't even as good as most gacha games. i miss overwatch 1. if it hadn't been deleted it would likely have more players barely a week after launch than overwatch 2."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"overwatch 1 is my favorite online shooter of all time and this one lives up to it, while it has improved in many ways there is still the negatives of free to play microtransactions, which can be overlooked for the most part."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"blizzard is just pathetic again, trying to rez a dead game for money combat pass and other skins overpriced. since diablo immortal i hate this company"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"they ruined the game. i was so excited for overwatch 2, only to find it as an essentially rebranded game. those skins you could once earn for free after paying 60 dollars for the game? haha, yeah. 15 dollars per legendary skin, now. it takes 12,000 dollars to buy everything that was one available to be earned in overwatch 1. these disgusting microtransactions make me miss lootboxes. lootboxes were saints compared to this b.s. i hope the game burns."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,broken balance and broken search with alot of noobs and just stupid people not noobs just realy stupid
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"i paid ow1, they deleted it. they wiped my thousands credits its not a bug or something because i have still nothing even 8 days after the release. they wiped thousands hours of grind by deleting all the xp and level you got. all that for what? for a game where you must pay with irl money for get characters while you already bought the game! and it's the same game, they just added the mechanics about the shop!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"overwatch 2's gameplay is the only saving grace for what is a game that forces you to spend large amounts of money for simple ingame cosmetics. the battle pass is moderately packed with detailed skins but the rest is filler that most people won't be interested in. not to mention that you can't earn currency in the battle pass unlike other free to play games like fortnite and apex. the game could've been a big update and just merged into the existing overwatch 1 like what fornite did with chapter 2 which brang graphical and gameplay improvements. although the removal of loot boxes would be liked by some, because it is a form of gambling, you didn't have to buy it and i much prefer it to actually paying for skins."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-12,"the majority of the reviews are just over entitled and factually incorrect. the game is free.... cant afford skins don't buy them give feedback they'll become cheaper if enough people agree. anyone who actively played ow1 and isnt living on rose tinted glasses knows ow2 is very different to play i cant remember any major game update like a new cod a new halo a new gow shock they are still halo gears and cod, if they wanted a 100 different game play a different game.... server issues on the first few days are annoying of course they are but running servers for a launch of one of the most popular titles in the world which without issue has been proven by every games company or every server based product in the world. sms protect happens to be in nearly every other game but for ranked mode, that may be the path blizz shouldve taken, but its worth noting no one wants your number take your tinfoil hat off or you hiding something? worth noting i've seen people complain that skins are expensive in a world where valorant exists and charges 4x the most expensive single skin bundle for a skin bundle. context is everything and youll not find it in the majority of these reviews. tldr the game is the most fun my friends and i have had playing overwatch in years"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch sequel is just a glorified patch. while did improve on ow, it's nothing new or exciting. the free to play model has taken all the thrill from the game. i find myself getting bored and it's only been a week, 10 hours of gameplay."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"same broken, unbalanced piece of trash as the first game. it's also pretty dumb that metacritic requires these reviews to be at least 75 characters long, as this game really doesn't deserve the time it took to type this sentence so i could post this."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,all things aside the new business plan is going to kill this game! worst idea ever ...
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch 2 is nothing but a quick cash grab, took everything that made ow1 fun and rewarding and locked it behind greedy microtransactions and awful ui and ux. the game is catered completely to those who looked for sweatier and more competitive matches while those that enjoyed semi relaxed 6v6 matches were told to kick rocks. this game is going to bleed users fast if they do not bring back 6v6, lootboxes damn shocker that and almost all of the ui and gameplay mechanics that made ow1 successful. i give it a 1 because a 0 just seems childish, it is a 1 because it spits in the face of the game that was much better and after killing ow1 to make ow2 this is a travesty of the highest. aaron keller should be ashamed of himself."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"for a game that's been years in the making, it seems like almost everything has taken a step back. they keep saying it's a new game, but aside from removing a tank and adding a couple of maps while taking away a few as well, it doesn't feel like a new game nor even a breath of fresh air... it's just overwatch but with monetization... when i started playing ow2, the queue to enter the game was long and for some reason, it still took over 57 minutes to find a match. when i finally did find a match, i noticed some weird bug going on with bastion he was able to fire many more times during his ult than he was supposed to.... there was also someone with an aimbot widowmaker... so much for the whole verification thing to cut down on hacking... for something teased years ago, it honestly feels like a huge step back... the only thing i kind of liked was that with 5v5, gameplay feels faster and there isn't the doubleshielded tanks situation that slowed down gameplay in overwatch 1. and as someone who payed for overwatch 1, it's kind of weird that i can't even play it anymore. so they took my purchase and are asking for more money? i mean, it's fine that a company needs to make profit, but this is not the way to do it. don't download this"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"they took everything good about overwatch and removed it, added in pay to play battle pass, removed all forms of social aspect, progression, customization, etc. it's just a worse version of overwatch 1. the queue times are insane, 35 minutes for quick play role queue during the first week of launch? yeah, that's a dead game. it's only 5v5 now too, not even 6v6. i can get a match in seconds in league of legends for example, which is also 5v5 and the games last 10 times longer. don't buy the battle pass, it's a complete scam. don't buy anything in this game. overwatch 2 is the death of what was once, a good game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"sequels don't delete their previous entry ow '2' has ruined the experience for me. the battle pass is insultingly bad, you cant get any legendary skins for free through it. it's buy or die not to mention it's riddled with bugs and is horribly incomplete. even when it works, ts insulting to call it a sequel"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"i specifically came here after redditors claimed that negative user scores were invalid which is insulting to the intelligence of the players, who are not blind to the laziness and greed of blizzard. overwatch 2 was launched incomplete. weapon charms were added to the game good in theory, but they were added lazily, with some pointing out that for one character, the charm sticks out of his hand, rather than being incorporated into their weapon. at launch i had access to one weapon charm which was not interesting enough to use. can you earn more? maybe? the battlepass system they implemented was confusing to understand, even with a tutorial. it is much less rewarding if rewarding at all than a loot box system let me be clear, there is a difference to me between loot boxes and paid loot boxes, the latter being debatably unethical, utilizing gambling mechanisms on vulnerable people to take money from them they otherwise would not have spent. i have seen many sources point out how expensive it would be to buy cosmetics, including cosmetics that were in ow1 i understand a company has to make money, but this smells of greed. the game does let you play as old skins from ow1, if you do not want to play as the ow2 skins, however, the ingame portraits for the character you are playing appears to be ow2, and there is no ability to change it, and at least for a couple characters, i do not like the new designs, and the portraits are distracting ow2 should allow you to select from more portraits, such as ow1 versions. i personally do not like the mode push as much as old modes. some of the new maps are bland, uninspired, and lack the amazing design of maps from ow1. i prefer 6v6 ow1 to 5v5 ow2. ow2 removes quality of life features from ow1. ow2 tweaks little things here and there which make them worse than ow1. ow2 downgraded postgame voting and commending, which was a terrible decision. if ow1 still existed blizzard ultimately broke their promise to maintain ow1 see the wikipedia article for overwatch for source, i might play it over ow2, but since i have no choice i will play ow2. but i notice i am playing ow2 less often than i did ow1, even though it is a brand new game. i will do my best to avoid spending any money on ow2, until blizzard addresses my concerns in this review, as well as countless others i have read in other reviews, on this site and others. ow1 was such an amazing game. ow2 is a downgrade of ow1, just so blizzard could try to squeeze more money out of players."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"its overwatch 1 but with less features and content. paywall for new characters is understandable because it is free to play, but taking away anything else is pure greed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"unfinished, buggy, and a terrible launch. to its credit, the only thing polished is the battle pass so we can spend more money."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"unfortunately, blizzard has once again failed to meet even the low, low bar they have set for standards. overwatch 2 or, 1.5 until it actually releases pve, has been riddled with more frustrating bugs than the release of cyberpunk. from inadequate servers which they blame on ddos attacks to locking people out of heroes while trying to fix bugs. but on a positive note, they have finally introduced a new classist patch. if you're poor they don't want your business. i'm glad they aren't hiding that anymore."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"the change to 5v5 is by far the worst decision theyve ever made with this game. its taken away all depth, synergy and need for tactics and i really didnt expect it to. one tank cant take nearly enough aggro and its really only about shooting and getting kills now, synergising abilities matters far less and the game is very dps focussed. frontline and back line are far less defined and fights are all a bit of a mess, teams have less survivability, fights are far shorter, healers get wiped so easily with minimal protection, healing feels more redundant a role with people dying so quickly, first pick determines most fights, and its more about individuals getting picks than synergising anything, individual play can have more impact but its at the expense of what made overwatch a great team shooter. it literally plays like somewhere between overwatch and traditional call of duty. this goes for some of the presentation as well, in terms of the sound design, how kills are confirmed, medals popping up for all kinds of different nonsense. their intentions are clearly to make this appeal to a wider audience by making it closer to a conventional shooter and dumbing it down, to then monetise the hell out of it. attract a new crowd of kids and make them want to buy loads of content. scumbags. 3 for an emote, 8 for a character skin. constantly pushing a battle pass which will constantly need renewing at around 10 a time. and what a joke to call this overwatch 2. theres not enough new content to even call it overwatch 1.5. maybe 1.1. literally one new hero of each class and a few maps. and the new game mode is so unbelievably bad. this in no way at all feels like a new game. its just overwatch 1 with a crappy battle pass, more micro transactions and cash grabs and a slightly new aesthetic. and the new stuff that is in the game is the worst stuff theyve ever done. the vultures have come to blizzard and all they care about is money. after how this, diablo and hearthstone have been, im officially done with blizzard and their greed. theyre finished"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,so as a middleclassed country individual that can only offer prepaid connection no need of post paid cellular network anyway cause i have postpaid wi fi connection i cant play the game. even waited since this was announced as freeto play title to try out cause didn't wanna spend money on ow1 at that time. played every esport fps title since this day and only this game has this horrendous verification system.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"horrible. just awful. i bought overwatch three years ago and have been playing all that time. i liked this game. played 1200 hours and on october 4 blizzard took away my ability to play. overwatch 2 freezes and crashes every five minutes. i can't finish the match even though the game is running at 60 fps. i got a lot of fines. for some reason, the ranked game is completely blocked, even without a timer. i wrote in support, they answered only two days later and said just wait, maybe they will fix it. there are thousands of people on the forums with the same problem. blizzard doesn't answer. but i congratulate you all, we have a wonderful battle pass. we all dreamed about it. someone in blizzard's leadership went crazy, released a very bad update and called it overwatch 2. very, very disappointed. the game just doesn't work. like i've been robbed."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"the game in itself is fun but riddled with bugs and connection errors. the real problem is that this ow doesn't feel rewarding at all. in ow1 i could spend several hours playing, and at the end of it, i would have earned a lot of cosmetics and stuff from the loot boxes, i could earn everything just by playing the game. there is no cards at the end of the game, no on fire during the match. it all feels so dull. this battle pass is a huge step back from what ow always has been. and is a disgrace to see the game i played thousands of hours, in this state. plz fix."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch was one of the best shooters on the market and overwatch 2 was set to continue it's legacy with some tweaks. the 5v5 is great. there's some fantastic new balance to the game and subtle improvements to sound and maps. there are new characters that are fun and dynamic. but all this is overshadowed by a terrible battlepass, a very poor launch, and frankly a lie told by the blizzard staff... where is the pve? this feels like a patch gone wrong, not a new game. it's free to play... sure, but i already owned ow1 and that was free to play as well. i find the entire thing confusing and underwhelming. blizzard continues it's money grabbing nosedive."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"i have hated many games in the past but overwatch 2 is the only game ever that made me create a metacritic account only to give it a bad review. this game is yet another miserable try of a once beloved franchise to keep themselves above water. lets ignore blizzards disgusting greed for money. ignore the fact that they now charge 20 bucks for 6 year old skins. its the absolute lazy finish of this game that can be seen around every corner that is just pissing me off. their pathetic battlepass that is supposed to be cyberpunk theme with its military camouflage winston and sojourn. broken ui that at times looks terrible. missing animations for certain heros. this game is just another dog cashgrab and even if we ignore all that, the game simply is no fun. the matchmaking of this game has yet to be the most broken matchmaking i have ever seen. throwing literaly new people into matches with former diamond players that have 800 hours in ranked alone. go  yourself and your entire franchise blizzard. i cant wait for diablo 4 to land in the top 10 worst rated games on metacritics to join the last 3 games you have launched."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"genuinely haven't had fun with the game, on top of the phone bs and server issues. blizzard has been hosting online games for 20 years. they have no excuses at this point. every blizz launch is a disaster, they are incapable of learning from mistakes"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"blizzards greed knows no bounds. they deleted the first overwatch, a game which over 50 million people paid money for and replaced it with this free to play garbage. overwatch 2 is not a sequel. it is literally just a patch with many significant downgrades that i'll list below. 1. collecting cosmetics skins, emotes, voice lines, etc was a large and fun part of the first game. you earned them by simply playing the game. an overwatch veteran that had been playing regularly for the past 6 years could quite literally have every cosmetic in the game without buying a single loot box. in overwatch 2 all this content was essentially made unattainable and placed behind an egregious paywall. a single legendary skin now costs 20 or an insane 8 months of grinding. it now costs a new player over 12,000 to get every cosmetic. blizzard has stripped the game of content that was previously free and is now forcing people to pay for it. 2. overwatch is now pay to win. while existing players get the new heroes immediately specifically kiriko, going forward after season 1, even veteran players will be subjected to the new pay to win model. new heroes will be free, but you'll have to grind for weeks to unlock them. meanwhile anyone that pays real money for the current battle pass will immediately unlock that season's new hero. 3. hit registration and mouse input is completely busted. casuals, and especially ones without good aim on hitscan, don't seem aware of this. it was immediately obvious to me how bad the game feels because of this. there are dozens of clips already floating around demonstrating the plethora of hit reg and mouse related issues this game has. 4. progression system has been neutered. in overwatch, one of the main progression systems was leveling up. you earned xp for playing the game and upon leveling up you received a random collection of cosmetics andor currency to buy specific ones you wanted. there was no level cap, so even veterans playing since 2016 could keep attaining this. this system is straight up deleted in overwatch 2 and you now must pay insane amounts of real money to keep collecting anything you didn't attain in the first game. 5. competitive ranks are hidden from the scoreboard. you can no longer see anyone's rank at a glance. this just further strips the game of any sense of progression, community, and individuality. the reasoning for this change is to combat toxicity, but that makes zero sense considering cards were replaced with a proper scoreboard which now directly shows statistics. this is a very illogical change. 6. new competitive rank icons are objectively a downgrade. why fix something that wasn't broken? i feel this was changed for no other reason than the sake of change. 7. competitive rank andor account level deleted from game is no longer displayed in the bottom left of the screen around your portrait. there is literally zero reason to also strip the players ability to see their own rank in a game. even if you hide everyone else's. this again strips away another sense of progression from players. 8. on fire system neutered. in overwatch you got a cool blue flame animation behindaround your character portrait in the bottom left and on the score screen when you were doing good. this system was great. it felt rewarding and gave players a sense of how well they were doing. this system was essentially deleted from overwatch 2 with again toxicity being the reasoning. 9. medal system removed. once again toxicity is the reasoning. removing this system strips the player of information. the medal system let you very quickly see at a glance how you were preforming. now you have to spend longer staring at a bunch of numbers. medals could have easily stayed in addition to the new detailed scoreboard statistics. 10. user interface is objectively downgraded. the ui both looks and performs worse. there is a plethora of screenshot and videos out there going over the issues. many parts of the ui are more unpleasant to look at, sloppily done ui elements misaligned, uneven, clipping, and the biggest issue is that there were pointless animations added to ui elements that previously opened  responded instantaneously. the biggest issue is the scoreboard  screen now has an animation instead of opening instantly. 11. legendary skins for the new heroes are a joke. all of them look like the most basic recolors. there's nothing special about them at all. blizzard actually put zero effort into the new hero skins. not that it matters because they are essentially unattainable because they each cost 20. it absolutely baffles me how such a large studio can make so many terrible decisions. i feel that a lot of this stuff was likely changed as an attempt to make the game feel new. rip overwatch. 20162022."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"it's a sequel but they somehow managed to make it a downgrade in almost every way imaginable.  incredibly predatory monetization  complete lack of progression  fewer maps  broke many existing mechanics and heroes somehow  removed many social features such as end cards, find a group  battlepass rewards 0 currency  skins cost 20 each  absolutely scuffed account transfers, career profile randomly deleting data  bug that caused players to unintentionally waste their unobtainable legacy coins simply by using the chat  bug that caused players to unintentionally waste their unobtainable legacy coins by simply clicking twice to buy a cosmetic.  above 2 bugs almost seem intentional to get players to burn the legacy coins to pay for premium currency, especially since they refuse to refund anyone affected by the bug."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch 2 is a joke. they removed fair monetization system and added absolutely mocking one. new battlepass is slow as hell, most of it is trash items and the only valuable thing there is heroes. they locked half heroes that already was free for new players beside that original philosophy of the game was that all heroes are available to everyone because game is build around counterpicks. not talking about lots of bugs infinity ults, lose of packets, not working localization on some heroes and more others. game is simply unfinished and this is considering that it is not really changed from the first one! yeah, they reworked some characters and removed one tank but it isn't not enough to call it a new game. i think it's time to admit that today's blizzard can't do anything good anymore. they can only  your money."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch 2 is a disappointment on many levels. overwatch is a cash grab that could have easily been a small dlc since the changes between ow1 and ow2 are minor at most. ow2 was made for blizzard recapture the public's interest in overwatch, release the same game, and heavily monetize it. it's the same overwatch game but worse, missing several qualityoflife features and updates, heavily monetized, and with little to no player progression. it's a free game but unlocking all the skins costs around 12,000 usd. overwatch 2 is a moneymaking tool. that and ow2 replaces ow1, so we can't even return to the old version if we wanted to. sms protect locks players out of the game because they're too poor to afford postpaid phone plans. blizzard tracks, records, and stores everything you do and say in the game so an issue with overall privacy. don't support greedy developerspublishers who only want to milk their customers for all they own."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"blizzard has ruined the game. i loved overwatch 1, nothing should have been changed. everything was perfect. if they wanted to release something new, maybe they should have just released a few maps and that's it. now you can't play a hero anymore. all of them have been completely nerfed in some way. unplayable. 0  10 stars."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"double shield, goats, brigitte, crowd control abilities. there were so many things that made ow1 frustrating. all of that is gone, the game feels more balanced and fun now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,after playing overwatch 1 for 6 years this game is a total crap for me. i didnt knew that they can destroy this game that much.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"6 years in the making, overwatch 2 has now permanently replaced overwatch 1 leaving no choice but to play the sequel. overwatch 2 was supposed to bring new experiences and a brand new player vs environment coop campaign. this was the highlighted feature and reason for developing overwatch 2, yet it is nowhere in sight. you may ask what else they've changed, well, they've reduced the team size from 6 vs 6 players down to 5 vs 5 making it so i can no longer play with my usual group of friends. while this in itself is outright terrible, it gets even worse. it's extremely insulting that unlocks for characters take months to grind for and many of the premium unlocks require spending as much as 20. in fact it would cost over 12,000 to buy all the current content in the game! this when you could get much of it quite easily in overwatch 1 just by playing far far less time than you would in overwatch 2. this entire game has been a slap in the face to long time fans of the game and an utter cash grab by blizzard. this company has zero respect for its fans. if they did, they would have kept overwatch 1 servers alive like many other companies do for their online games. i'm sure almost everyone given the choice would rather be playing overwatch 1"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"i enjoy the gameplay, like the new push mode. i do wish we didn't have the battlepass, because it does . however, for a free game, i don't mind it, i don't need skins to enjoy a game. it's a great game to play with friends."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"pro  excellent optimization  excellent netcode cons the result of six years of work on the balance is the reduction of the team by one player. problem is blizzard don't know what balance is, the gameplay is absolutely not balanced. an equal fight between two teams is a rare exception"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch 2 is at the time of writing still not fully out pve modes are not out yet but regardless there are serval problems that i'm very worried about for the long run of this game. 1 the monetization is just downright bad, 1 legendary skin is nearly 20 and so is the best version of the battle pass witch is ultimately a let down. the next problem is that the coins that are required to buy anything, are only obtainable in two ways, by either buying them with real money, or completing 11 weekly challenges for 60 coins witch is not enough for even the cheapest items in the store. legendry's cost 1100 coins so at a max of 60 coins a week it would take almost 19 weeks for one skin or what blizzard wants is for your 20. 2the lack of incentives is also a problem and it ties into the 1st problem being because everything cool is locked behind a pay wall you'll have nothing to grind for or feel accomplishment for unlocking. one way to fix both problems would be to increase the coins gained from challenges and add the coins to daily and sessional challenges as well, and add coins in free tears of the battle pass and some of the paid tears to incentives grinding that out. something else to look at is the fact that blizzard could be doing a 2 steps forward 1 step back by making it really bad monetization wise now only to go a little bit back so consumers are more ok with some still very predatory ways of making money from you. finally the game its self is still enjoyable but that shouldn't give the other problems a free pass. edit a legendary is actually 1900 coins so at a max of 60 a week it will take around 32 weeks of grind for one skin"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"this is nothing like overwatch, new players be warned as you must unlock essential characters either through a paywall or spending hours and hours of time. all skins must be paid for with real money or grind on daily challenges that only give you a small percentage of what is needed to buy the skins. also you need a valid phone plan to even play the game so they can sell your info. please do not play this game it is not worth your time what so ever. go buy the nee call of duty instead at least you are getting a complete game when you buy the newest cod."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,the changes in the game make it so this is more like a cod game than a hero shooter. the new maps are very poorly balanced. battlepass is a huge grind and you have to pay for skins now. it's a step forward in some ways but ultimately 5 steps backward.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"as a longtime overwatch player and fan, i am disappointed beyond belief with overwatch 2 as an entire package  this feels like a project that should've been scrapped years ago, and if given the option i would rather continue to play overwatch 1 instead as it was a far superior game by a longshot. this is the first time a game has ever pushed me to actually write a review on it. i created this account for the sole purpose of expressing just how awful this game truly is  that should say something. while the core gameplay is still decent and can be fun at times, it absolutely pales in comparison to the almost 247 fun i had with overwatch 1. overwatch 2 is one of those games that are really only fun about 5 of the time."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,since 2021 i knew that ow2 is going to be worse that ow. i'd rather play tf2 247 than this garbage game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"the game  balls. i was playing ow1 till the very last moment. dont even feel like playing this one. 5v5 is horrid, the sounds effects are horrid, the whole feel of the game just  balls now.. bring back ow1!!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"las colas para entrar durante los primeros 3 dias fueron una total basura, pero sabemos que esto eventualmente se va a solucionar. dejando eso de lado el juego sigue siendo el mismo overwatch de siempre, un poco mas frenetico porque ya no hay dos tanques y ya no se trata de ver quien destruye los escudos del equipo contrario primero. buena jugabilidad es un fps bastante rapido con mucha accion durante las partidas. hay variedad de campeones para elegir por lo que puedes variar tu forma de jugar siempre que quieras, cuesta tiempo llegar a dominar las mecanicas de algunos campeones y saber utilizarlos correctamente. la monetizacion es un punto debil los pases de batalla son una forma de monetizar que me agrada mucho en los free to play, tienes objetivos a completar y cada cierto tiempo iran agregando mas contenido al juego. pero comprar skins por separado es un robo. 20 dolares una skin legendaria? vaya mierda, para conseguir esa skin jugando las misiones semanales literalmente tendrias que jugar meses no hay modo historia si bien han dicho que agregaran el modo historia en 2023, para que sacas otro puto juego en el que destacabas el modo historia como el punto fuerte sin un modo historia, vaya mierda nuevamente. con todo y sus problemas, como hero shooter es bastante bueno para jugar con los amigos. es dificil aburrirse debido a los diferentes modos de juego creados por blizzard y todo lo creado en la workshop por parte de la comunidad"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,i pay 40 to buy overwatch1 but i dont have anything better for this new game ? i think this is new patch not the new game
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"while the beta went unbelievably smoothly, the launch is just terribly painful. the final nail in the coffin for the overwatch franchise for me. models, sounds and viewmodels take a literal eternity to load in, out of curiosity i waited how long it would take to load in my viewmodel in the shooting range and it took a whopping 20 minutes while the bots took another 5 minutes, i am running the game on a 3060 and an i511400 with more than enough ram by the way. the beta was more stable and way smoother than the launch in every way, what a joke. updated all my drivers, scanned and repaired the game 2 times, set all the settings to low, and it still didn't really fix any of the issues i had. thank god i didn't have to spend 60 on this game, i feel bad for everyone who did."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,really just extension of overwatch 1 and add to many thing to buy... now i see the activision side
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch 2 more like overwatch reforged. seriously getting rid of the original like that abomination is something i find baffling. especially when you're gonna require new players to have a specific kind of phone plan can't believe it's gonna be done again with cod mw2 2022 if it weren't for the occasional thing, they put out that piques my interest hi crash  spyro i'd be totally avoiding them like the plague. as it stands for those exceptions? well. let's just say i've got no shame waiting for them to go on sale would buy used. but knowing they possibly already got full price from someone makes me sick"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,pure cringe. i had never felt so embarrassed of what this industry has become
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,an update disguised as a sequel. no pve. and the monetization is one of the worst. no currency on the battlepass. the only way to get coins is grinding weekly challenges for months. legendary skins are disgustingly overpriced.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,exactly the same as ow 1 just some minor changes.. i dont know how u can tell this is a new game .. we wait this game for have only 3 new character and this is it ! thx blizzard ! oh yeah now u need to pay for all skins and no more lootbox so i hope u are ritch .. and im not gonna talk about all bugs or the time u need to wait for go into the game ..
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,absolutely no reason to be a sequel besides the fact they wanted to monetize the game even more now with the pass
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"catastrophic launch but very good game, there are a lot of interesting mechanics"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,i played overwatch 1 and really enjoyed it. this mess is not enjoyable and feels like a bad knock off of overwatch. games are blow outs in one direction or the other and at times it feel like the games included bots instead of regular players. simply not an enjoyable game to dedicate your time too.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,this game has gone down the same hole as halo infinite except its somehow somewhat worse this game is a total downgrade from overwatch 1 the shop is just reselling overwatch 1 skins for awful prices that you could have gotten for just playing the game in my opinion the loot box system of overwatch 1 wasn't even that bad and was probably one of the better loot box systems in a game at the time and i would definitely prefer it over what overwatch 2 has 20 dollars of this overwatch coin for a skin you could get for free its a literal scam the only new content is the time of day changing on maps 3 new heroes a battle pass and a couple of hero reworks not to mention them making it 5v5 which i think just makes the game worse it so odd how blind blizzard is to what's around them like halo infinite was a big problem and they are following in its footsteps into a grave
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,its just a bad version of overwatch 1. they removed everything that was good about the game just to make the game free and make the rest behind a paywall.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,kinda wish you got a bit more exp from matches but overall not bad. waiting on story mode
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"bad conexin, bad graphi, bad game. me gustara que est juego le cambiarn todo"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,why was this game even made? microsoft and activisionblizzard deserve each other they are both detrimental to the gaming industry. can you take this off my playstation please?
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch 2 will go down in history as one of the most pathetic releases and sequels of modern games. yep, it's up there with cyberpunk. i don't know who at the top is making the call to release every major title so horribly unfinished and lackluster, but i'm sure it can't be the developers. i can't, i refuse to imagine that someone worked on this for years, and thought this was good to go. it shames me as a fellow creator and a customer."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"worse overwatch 1 they took the og game and made it worse in every aspect, except the change to 5v5 with 1 tank."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"has so many bugs, locked characters even after merging overwatch 2 account. how does it make sense to lock most characters when you have over 800 hours played from overwatch 1? battlepass has no substantial awards in the free track. have to buy the battlepass for the new hero, which is lame. this game literally feels like overwatch 1 just got a patch, minor graphical upgrades, and new dialogue for characters. besides that, its just another game that activision blizzard will monetize the crap out of for money."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,thanks for the 20 euro skins that used to be free. battlepass without premium currency is something completely new. congratulations you made the worst monetization.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"the balance is impressive for a game with so much specialists. moreover, the essence of the game, based on teamplay is really interesting and challenging. very good game to try on top of that it is free, especially for those who don't like battle royale. waiting for the pve"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"bring back the first part, it's terrible. instead of loot boxes which you got for free per level or in events, you added a battlepass that is 99 garbage. removed a lot of little things from the design that were very cool for example, the fire on the character's avatar when he made a lot of kills. the character design has become much worse, your legendary skin for the queen looks like a repaint of her standard one  in general, i have a very vague feeling from the game now and it's common for me because i really loved the first part."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,not way too far from what i expected. i mean how much further can u develop new ideas into a title that's already great. graphics were upgraded... getting rid of a tank role ... feels different but not a bad idea maybe its easier to find a team of 5 than a team of 6 after all.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"overwatch was remove from me for this game. its a predatory greedy f2p, the pricing of skins and the battlepass. i get why they had to remove overwatch, no of the playerbase would go to this  that is ow2. there are few thigns that im not dissapointed in. blizzard please just let me have overwatch back, i can't belive you spend 3 years on ow2 and this is what we get."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,really funny game but blizzard need activate crossplay consolepc for ranked games because i can't play with my friends in ranked
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"the only reason it's not a 0 is because of the promise of future content old overwatch was a solid 89 but instead of being able to play either of the games old one was killed of for this glorified patch new overwatch is less team based lack of 2nd tank and cc in dps let's a lot of characters run rampant that would previously be held in check by crowd control tracer sombra outside of game play, monetization feels miserable compared to the previous option, you either put out your wallet not rly an option to pay my wage of 5h for a skin esp when they would be free in old overwatch simple solution would be to put loot boxes back in overwatch a sentence that i never thought i'd use or monetize the game on the level of fortnite battle pass where you have more than enough money to buy a new battle pass from the previous one not every other one like we have now also battle pass progesion is screwed so against the player it's hilarious at best we don't play video games to have a second job, we do it to have fun and i hope execs realize that soon or they will keep losing players to fortnite i'd be embarrassed in their place overall the gameplay experience feels worse monetization feels like it's made to not even make us want to pay up, just straight up quit new vc is as empty as always i hope microsoft starts putting this embarrassing game back in shape soon or else the most fun pvp franchise out there will straight up die"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"i have been playing this game since the closed beta ow1. i'm main healer and thanks to overwatch 2 i'm stopping playing this game. the role has been undervalued and it's impossible to do anything, you depend 100 on your teammates. during my first games, fighting for getting my first rank, i have been disconnected from the game twice, and 3 people left in other 3 games. servers are garbage, and the whole game has been now designed for monetizing. poor matchmaking and a toxic community, as always. good bye overwatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"better than the first one imo. less chaos w 5 players. haven't followed whatever drama is causing this score, but we are enjoying the game for sure."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,this game is a mess of bugs and terrible business practices. not worth the time investment.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,it's definitely unfair. i bought overwatch 1  premium finished game but now blizzard changed it to overwatch 2  mobilelike money  dullness.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"another pile of  from decaying blizzard. last thing from them i enjoyed was wotlk before they sold their asses to activision. never paid a penny and never played their 'projects' since then. don't waste your time and money, guys, let these greedy promoting lgbt  go bankrupt. in memory of the good old games blizzard assosiateted with long time ago..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,as a resource management enjoyer i do love the new feature they implemented where you try to earn as much as you can while spending the least amount of money. next to the 10 coins i got in this week of grind i even got a 15 dollar skin! it was a twitch drop!! epic win! but in recent setback i regret to infrom you all that i invested 7 dollars worth of coins to salt emote and a junker queen voiceline.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"let me play overwatch overwatch 1!! i bought it!! this is def not a o2 it is just marketing stunt to draw publicity and do free to play go live. the problem is that the game apart from  mode. night map. 3. 3 new heroes o2 is a downgrade from the product o1 fans bought for full price. quality that o1 had is gone in so many places 1. progression system!! 2. missing skins, currency and collectibles! migration bug 3. bugs and server stability 4. game loop is now nonexistent and locked behind game pass 3. quality and polish blizzard was known in menus, sounds, transitions, skin creativity and tone also dead"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,it's so boring. clunky. and no pve mode which is supposed to be the thing!?
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,it really seems to copy and paste from overwatch 1 with more bugs and even worst gameplay. everything is locked away unless you've been playing before.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"encore un gros de l'industrie qui ne pense plus du tout  quilibrer la balance entre profit, plaisir du joueur et qualit..... vouq allez finir par couler ..... ne perdez pas votre temps dans ce jeu...."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"worst game ever... it's not even a new game, it's just a meh patch with some maps and op heroes that will be nerfed 3 months after... blizzard is pathetic."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,une incroyable copie d'overwatch 1 de gaspiller pas votre argent pour lui ....
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"this is unacceptable!!! lets not pretend overwatch 1 never existed for a second and think about what they are doing! they dummed down the entire game, removed medals, removed level progression, removed a way to get skins for free, made the game 5v5 without an option to play 6v6 if we want and list goes on and on... lets focus on the skins for a second, you are saying that what they are doing is fine?  no! i'm not gonna pay 13 of the price of overwatch 1 for one legendary skin in a game that has over a 100 of them!!??!! the legendary skins should be maximum of 2 a pop and not even a cent more and we should have a currency that we can earn by just playing the game to buy the epic skins for free! blizzard you can still sell your bundles and legendary skins but please 20 for a single skin is just outrageous. now watchpoint pack i paid 40 to get a battle pass and 2000 points so basically 1 legendary skin, meanwhile some games who ask for that price give you multiple seasons of battlepass and bunch of more goodies, i hear what you are gonna say but you get ow1 and its skins with it i already have it blizzard, i had the game of the year edition before, ive had all these skins already and guess what i cant even play overwatch 1 a way better game than what we have right now with ow2. and the biggest blunder of this pack is that it doesnt even guarantee you access to ow2 pve in 2023, they will probably charge us 60 on top of this for that game mode which was supposed to be the entire point of the overwatch 2 in the first place. this has to change! don't sit around thinking its gonna change itself be vocal about it leave reviews post tickets to blizzard talk on forums lets just make them realize what they are doing with the game we all love and have been playing for past 5  6 years."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,honestly feels like the same game as overwatch. one reason i put a negative score is because all my characters were unlocked then all the sudden they are locked. slow log in times and it seems like they are trying to force people to buy the battle pass. this is basically what killed destiny and looks like they are leading to the same path.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"enjoying the game a lot more than ow1, i have total of 1300 hours on the game and i can say its better than recent ow1 seasons. reminds me of ow 2016. battlepass is not that good but has no impact on the actual game and the fun part of it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,blizzard removed all the features that made ow unique and what people like. bugs are everywhere and most characters were nearly unchanged even with the transition from 6v6 to 5v5. and the change of 6v6 to 5v5 was a questionable move itself.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"how to kill games, just ask blizzard, first wow, than hs than diablo now overwatch, you can kill games very effectively, you know all the reagents, ingame transactions, pay to win, reducing to 0 the require skill whats need to play the game, shame on you blizzard , you made the game much worse, but u will make 10x more money, i would kill you if i could"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"this is the biggest piece of  you could step in, overwatch 2 is a runofthemill f2p teambased shooter that passes its predecessor in no way, shape, or form. this redundant stench lingering in the gaming scene that is still overwatch isn't what it was a long time ago. now it's just a predatory monetization tactic for a failing company that fell off ever since jeff kaplan departed the scene and boy, was that the best choice he would make in his career. overwatch 2 is quite possibly one of the worst instances  turned to  cause of the fortnite effect, ty battle pass, ty eye candy cosmetics and the worst of all, they made so many unexcusable changes to how the game works and removed loot boxes basically rendering progression useless. whatever you do, don't touch, see, or even smell this games presence on your gaming platform, you'll be alot happier if you never play this reeking pile of dogpiss."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-11,"not sure why it's ow 2 instead just dlc, it's exact same game as ow 1 with actually less features that were removed. the new battle pass made loot box look good that just sums it all up on how greedy and terrible blizzard games has became."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,they try force me to share my phone number? no thanks i suggest to avoid this game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"the game is fine, never trust stupid people rating games with zeros. overwatch 2 is still fun to play and i liked most of the changes. i do agree tho this shouldn't be a sequel, but a revision. it's still suffering from ddos attacks and that's why servers are struggling to keep up. it's not perfect, but still a good game you should play at least once."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"they took the first slapped on a update and called it a new game. what does the update entail then? it includes a worse and more predatory progression and monetary system than the lootboxes. only one new map, even less incentive to play healers bc of the progression system and how fun they are compared to dps or tanks. they didn't fix roles and quetime either. i'd give it a zero out of spite, but bc overwatch one was fun and they didn't change the gameplay much, it's still fun. just greedy, sad and disappointing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"not even a new game. it's just ow1 with features stripped out, predatory monetization so you can't get anything unless you pay activision extra cash, and a massive banwave against anyone not using the approved cell service providers."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"seriously, based on the current state of this game after roughly a dozen updates, i'm getting ready to uninstall and wait for blizz to get it's  together in 69 months after they've compiled their data and figured out what's not working, which is basically everything outside of the core game modes ui, battle pass model, server  no fire mode, no cards, no stat recap at end of match, etc, etc. interesting ideas weakened by some 5v5 epiphany they thought would solve everything but really didn't. i think a lot of pro reviewers have been fooled by the shortcut that was taken here, which just creates a qptrash style deathmatch scrum on the pl where the game devolves to 2 healers desperately keeping the one tank alive while trying to not die themselves since there's no time for peeling. if the dps even moderately  and can't find health packs, or the tank forgets part of their kit, it's game over. and it's all wrapped in corporate f2p bull and a launch that just wasn't wellprepared because, for some reason, the shareholders wanted to see this live now now now. nope, maybe later, and good luck with the stock portfolios. blizz has simply lost the basics. they're now also lost in putting out fires without realizing some of the more fundamental problems with this reboot... i don't need to throw my money at it until it's ready, which it clearly isn't for now and i'd be surprised if it's still alive in a year. calling it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"do i even need to detail why this deserves a 0? 1. i paid 60 for overwatch on console when it released and another 40 for when i switched over to pc. why are you taking away something i spent money on? i understand why blizzard feels the need to change the game and make corrections but why strip us of the game we paid for. 2. the new monetization scheme is absolutely horrendous for both new and old players. i mean 20 for a skin that came out 6 years ago and was free with the original ow credits, are you serious? this part feels like a sick joke to us original players and is just flat out disrespectful. the battle pass is also terrible but ill get into that. 3. terrible battle pass system that rewards players for paying and gives the people who dont pay practically nothing for playing the game. i understand its a f2p game and skins shouldnt be why people play, but its just dumb to force people to pay for the battle pass if the want to earn anything interesting especially since most of us have already bought ow. 4. extremely buggy and terrible launch. i dont even need to go into detail for this one. 5. lack of anything new, yes they may have updated ui, added some new heroes and maps, reworked 6v6 into 5v5, and made changes to existing heroes, but why does this need to be an entirely new game? it feels like the same game to me aside from balancing certain things out but honestly the ui is a complete downgrade for me. 6. lack of new skins and content, i understand that this is more of a nitpick but like why is a skin 20 when it is basically just a re olor of the default skin? this if for multiple heroes too. 7. still requiring specific phone numbers for new users. this is stupid. i dont even know what else to say i feel like i could go on and on but whats the point. blizzard wont listen to me or anyone else because they are a selfish and greedy company that views their fans as nothing more than consumers which most are. i cant help at least writing a review for this game though. shame on blizzard for this"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,game is nice.. it brings my old memories back when i played overwatch1 with my friends. only concern is that blizzard's bad maintenance.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"this is now the worst game i've ever played, i'm top 500 and have thousands of hours and have played the game for 5 years and spent hundreds of dollars on the game. they still made me wait 3 years just to get this piece of garbage they took all the enjoyment out of comp by ruining the competitive system made me wait in over 20 hours of queues and disconnecting me multiple times in comp games there's an uncountable amount of bugs and the game is barely playable nice job blizzard. this game is just an excuse to add a battle pass."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"they took out tank synergy, the best cosmetic system in any game ever, the best rank system in any game ever, great sound design, and last but not least they took out fun. don't worry because they did add plenty new things too though. they added the worst cosmetic system in any game ever, the worst rank system in any game ever, up to hour long wait times just to get to the main menu, constant disconnects, and the need to pay to unlock characters on a game that i payed for 5 different times. well done blizzard you really outdid yourself with this one."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"this game is a patch. it's derivative of itself somehow and feels like a cynical cash grab to try to boost it's own ratings by artificially inflating how much work is required to fully experience the game. understandably, the game is free now, which makes sense for a patch so i will say that you get your money's worth, but where the original overwatch brought something new and exciting to the table, this is really just more of the same, but with more work expected of the player for the honor of playing it. season pass makes sense for a free game, but when i already had paid for ow proper, this just feels like a let down that i would have received better had they just iterated on the old one, which is literally all this is. again, bonus points for being free, but my time is not free, and ow 1 isn't available anymore because everyone knows that shows the nature of this release. your time could be much better spent elsewhere."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"people who think the game is bad are so stupid. they clearly don't know what good games are. usually when people say overwatch 2 is bad, they play the  games. people hate on ow2 for no reason."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"this game is a serious step backwards. its incredibly clear that the only purpose of making this game was simply to get more money out of an audience they already got hooked, and are now forcing that same once loyal audience to play a functionally inferior game with worse incentives for playing. do not support this awful company."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,its really just overwatch 1  more micro transactions. and half the game it doesnt even work or locks half your heroes out.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,with 2 minutes in the bta you know ... feel like a bad copy poor and empty. they surely add play with your money but even this they fail too. i really enjoy the new short but because it is just story telling and not in the game i won't give any points. blizzard will go down in a few years .
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"you ever make a friend that things turn out well but then you start to realize they act funny? overwatch 2 is when the trusted friend tries to move into your house without paying rent, and you forgive that, they then hit on your wife and try to shoot your dog and smash the family pictures in what was once a happy home much good the game is if you can boot it up... skins are corny and played out the basic colors for sale is wack the battle pass, wack price range for items, wack rewards for doing challenges, wack free pass items, wack new maps being daynight remakes, wack the fortnite colors, wack the merging line, wack lack of heroes, wack the fact it's 80 recycled, wack no dual tanking, wack deleting overwatch 1 for what will seem to be a rerelease cash grab, wack."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,it's a reskin. and a mediocre one. half as much content per new character. bugs everwhere. account doesn't correctly track stats. merging accounts causes more bugs. player balancing is miserable. it's bad. it's also not new so. it's bad.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"horrible! if youre gonna have a competitive team fps game maybe make sure your servers dont crap out and crash the match right before the end!!! its a broken, buggy game. even tho its free to play dont bother investing the time to learn and grind out the hero unlocks, play anything else and save yourself frustration."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i look. i loved overwatch. but after playing through today, it just feels dead. the visual updates are nice, and i like the added depth of sounds, but its very clear its lost its soul. the new voices lines for every character are very poorly written in my opinion, it takes a single element of their character and makes it their whole personality, making them seem far more one dimensional than they did before. whoever did the writing didnt treat them like characters but like stereotypes, which makes me shudder to think how the story mode is going to go if just the voice lines in gameplay is flat. the visualls are chaotic , and very hard to look at when youre fighting team v team. i dont really care about the battle pass stuff because im very picky about skins and am happy with the ones i have, but it is disheartening to see how much youd have to play just for one skin. can you imagine being a new player and seeing that you have to play for 8 months before you can get a skin?? i much prefer lootboxes, it was fun and easy and everyone could get one without dropping money. and this is just a personal thing but i think so far that the new skins are not well designed. they look like leftover character designs that got scrapped, not intentionally designed skins. i dont care about the battle pass, because i dont care about the rewards, theyre not attractive or fun enough to be worth caring about. kinda like this game as a whole as it stands. im uninstalling for now, maybe in a few months once stuff gets repaired and maybe blizzard gets a clue about how much less fun this game is ill try again."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,the game lock me an overwatch 1 player since launch from skins i paid for in overwatch one by making me pay 20. what type of greed is that. then the wafting times are half an hour to get into one game. also there is no punishment for leavers like a temp 1 hour ban after leaving 4 games in 24h period so your team mates leave if they are losing so the useless players leave but also somehow make it worse. 1 no leveling up only a crap battle pass 2no reward for playing...nothing and the nerve to give me ow 1 skins as a reward is just insulting 3no on fire even tho character say i am on fire.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"from the very first second you enter the game you are greeted by a wall of advertisements for the micro transactions and the overly complicated monetization systems. when you literally prefer the old lootbox system, you know you're not playing a game anymore. not only did i hve to suffer 3 years of no love to overwatch 1. now they completely replaced it so i can't even go back."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,when you can get in half the time heroes are locked. constant bugs and issues. connection to servers is hit or miss and can often be seen rubber banding. played on pc and switch and this is almost identical to ow1. really thought i'd love to get back into the game but holy cow this is a mess.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"tenho um pc acima dos requisitos para jogar e mesmo assim o jogo crasha toda partida, experincia pssima."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,don't support the bs anymore. blizzard is done gg. they locked legacy heroes behind a paygrind wall. rip overwatch.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i paid 40 to play overwatch a while ago. now i can't play the game i own because i can't afford a postpaid phone number.  you, blizzard."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"tldr same game with half the heroes locked. not worth it even slightly! absolutely do not get this game! i'm sure you've already heard all about the server issues, hit tracking issues, greedy battlepass, limited new maps and heroes, and no new gamemodes. to top it all off, even if your expectation was just to simply play the same characters you enjoyed you will be sorely disappointed! i uninstalled the old one shortly before 2 launched didn't know if it'd just update or not and downloaded 2 only to find that literally over half of the characters were locked and needed to be unlocked by battlepass. this game is a shell of what it used to be, and it's been going downhill for a loooooonng time. don't listen to critics, as you probably know they're notoriously bad in this industry. it's almost the same exact game, which is nothing to rave about don't understand how critics can, only difference is now you're missing a bunch of stuff."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,requiring a phone number to help prevent a toxic community? this not only is a flimsy excuse for requiring unnecessary information that will be sold to 3rd parties but it also locks those with less money out of the game. if blizzard wants a toxic free environment they should start by removing themselves.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,heros are getting locked for overwatch 1 users from a bug and let me tell you the battle pass is worse than halo infinites like my goodness is this were the gaming industy is heading because let me tell you if battlefield 2042 and halo halo infinite fell off for player count i wont be surprised if this happens to overwatch 2 also now i see why jeff kaplan left because overwatch is turning into a live service game at this point because overwatch 2 battle pass you dont even earn credits coins even the paid version when leveling up but you can check for yourself by looking up all the unlockable stuff but there wont be any unlockable credits coins smh
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i played overwatch since it's original launch. it was vastly superior to it's sequel in nearly every way. the game had more flair, teamwork was more interesting, there was more time to work with your team, and a millionandone little details made the experience fun. overwatch 2 feels like a beta, still. it's missing so much. if that were the only issue, the game would be playable. instead, it's rife with bugs. most people in the world not hyperbole, it's affecting everyone at the moment suddenly got locked out of almost the entire roster of heroes. two heroes have been removed from play because of grossly abusable bugs that are affecting gameplay. there are login queues, of all things. blizzard use to be a big deal because they made the best games, bar none. now they're a big deal because of how far they've fallen. they should have just left overwatch 1 live and canned overwatch 2."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i have countless hours on overwatch 1 it's easily my most played game over the last 5 years, it had its ups and downs but nothing like ow2. gameplay wise it's no longer the game i loved, they killed it... it's a game of protect the tank! tanks are now like the big boss on each team ... the tank goes down first and your team goes down first... teamplay feels no longer there. the greed?! this is a mobile like experience, yes you can play for free but u can't access all the content without a grind, and most cosmetics are now locked behind a way paywall.. such a greedy practice it's the worst system by far i've seen in such games. i hate it"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"the game is a hot mess. they had a stable 6v6 with great features, and now we have a 1.5 patch update loaded with micro transactions, locked character, game breaking bugs and horrible servers."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"this is more like overwatch 1.2 still fun.. but nothing new, apart from the exaggerated pay walls and micro transactions"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"same game as overwatch 1. the only system to be updated is the monetization system which is absolutely horrible. so many bugs, issues, etc."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i've never written any reviews on the site, but overwatch 2 managed to piss me off on so many levels... 1 week to get into the game, get banned in the middle of the game because of the server, expensive battle pass and with boring rewards. money in the game is hell to get and even doing missions, the game doesn't count and you lose challenges. it's not worth the change for 2 if they're going to do a worse and dull service. they abandoned the first game and these changes from the second would fit in very well in the first. all to force people who have already paid for the game to spend even more on the second one. frankly, blizzard doesn't get one right. it's one  after another. and now even paying, you still have your characters blocked and you can't use them. they managed to ruin everything that was good about the game. can't expect anything good from this company."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,overwatch 1 but better and fixed issues.a new reguivination is overwatch revival by fixing issues and adding some new content
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"worst launch to a game ive ever played. i regret spending my money on the beta and watch point pack considering i cant even use 23 of the regular characters when im able to actually stay in a game. its not like my comment will matter though lol, theyre fine with the servers being crap as long as they keep making the money"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"lovely of blizzard to release an almost identical game to one i already paid for but to now charge for new heroes.  company,  game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"here's a few issues i've had  purchases in the store not reflecting payed 10 for bp, not received in account for some reason  launch issues that are still ongoing in general the game isn't worth playing unless you have bp or had ow1, since there's important characters you can't access in multiplayer. i think any amount of greed is justified for purely cosmetic items, but locking things behind a paywall for new players is mega  up."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"the new battle pass is extremely greedy and grindy, even with premium. especially with premium. good features have been removed from ow1 and the launch was insanely buggy. due to a bug, i can't play all the heroes even though i'm not a new user. also, new heroes will be locked behind the battle pass, which is insanely  i really wanted ow2 to be good, i've been playing ow1 weekly for the past 5 years. this is such a disappointment."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"there is so much to write that has already been written, so allow me to point out what no one talks about. 1. mei wall is completely broken. it clearly has had no play testing done 2.doom does more melee per second, than his main fist. not kidding.  ambiguity about how credits would transfer from ow1 to ow1.1  reason i got on here to write this over half the hero's are locked currently. half. i cant play dva. doomfist, roadhog, sigma, wrecking ball, ashe, cassidy, echo, genji, hanzo, junkrat, mei, sombra, symmetra, torbjorn, ana, baptiste, brigitte, kiriko, and zenyatta. that's 20. 20 new hero's which i thought i bought back in 2016. and this is all because they're locking hero's behind a battle pass and for new players because the cheating is extremely easy in a ftp game this game launch is clearly a disaster behind the scenes. bad take, but i don't care at this point how low down the corporate foodchain this is, this is  extreme, and there isn't a single person at blizzard that doesn't know this.  you. blizzard. speak out against this terrible company"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,blizzard needs to stop being so anticonsumer. this game is the embodiment of laziness and greed. day after day its fiasco after fiasco and controversies. when will you learn to respect your players blizzard?
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"when it comes to gameplay ow2 is masterclass in its field sporting extremely positive changes from its 6v6 counterpart now going a traditional 5v5 route. the changes in this game are extremely well done changing the flow of the match to center around the tanks far more than before however now the dps, and support classes can shine much brighter than previously possible. support role a previously unfun but necessary role is now a lot more enjoyable to pick up, and play. i've played ow for a while enough to touch top 500 in a season, and really love this game i just wish the controversy surrounding the game, and its company didn't ruin it for a lot of people."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"it was so bad. my main, wrecking ball, has been wrecked. 1 tank vs 2 tanks on the group  goodbye brawler tanks. no new cosmetics, microtransactions up the wazoo, have fun grinding for 2 months to get a skin. hitreg was terrible, felt janky, i wish i could give this a worse score. this game was so bad, i shorted activisionblizzard stock and got my money back through capitalism. uninstalled my  launcher. words fail to adequately express my immense disappointment with this trashfire ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"pegaram e primeiro jogo e tacaram lutebox super caras, mudaram umas fontes, adicionaram umas sking e chamaram de overwatch 2. chamar de segundo jogo  a maior propaganda enganosa que existe"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"damn... how they mess up so much, got the damn battlepass because of all character 2 day later they are locked again,  is game is more stressul that ow1 even before the match start and after the match end there nothing about poregess on the fck gamepass"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,010 because they took a game i paid for and played everyday and completely replaced it with something that crashes every time i get into a match. i literally own a game i can't play that replaced the game i loved. years of  and cosmetics down the drain.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"game is unplayable, mainly because of an issue where the game is booting me after every earned achievement. how can releasing a sequel that nothing changed in only break more things? won't be playing again until the achievement issue is fixed."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"the game is a great upgrade for what was the original but peoples keep bullying for it is a blizzard game, they blame the servers issues on them where they got ddos'ed on their release date, totally downvoting without even trying the game server issues are for the most part been fixed"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,".         .   !?    ,     ,      ,      .           ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,ow1 was ended so you couldn't play the old game when people found out ow2 is awful. everything just felt like adjustments then you don't get any way to get coins at all now. they are just money hungry and want to get a battle pass and play going thru the the battle pass is slow. it's like their trying to be awful on purpose.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,having played overwatch1 every week since launch  this sequel is genuinely an embarrassment. it feels like a downgrade instead of an upgrade. the choices the dev team and management made with ow2 are beyond amateurish. such a shame to stain an excellent former product like this.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"how does one ruin a game this much, like what? i played overwatch for a long time, but the servers are awful, they somehow messed up the aiming. everything feels floaty it all . i logged in today and half my characters were locked, characters i've already played in overwatch 2. like how is that even possible to screw up that badly???"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i must say, as a 1.6k hour ow1 player, ow2 is the worst combination of what i expected. unless you are 5 stacks, you will always have a teammate that does nothing the entire game. that could be because my hidden mmr was too high in ow1. i keep getting new players in my team which ruins every single game. blizzard can easily solve this by adding a newcomer player list. but as we know, blizzard is an incompetent company that is already bankrupt and does not even care about anything except grinding money. the joke is, for 3 years they did a game that is so buggy and ugly that they have to decide to make it free to even make money. i have to say, if you can give a negative rating, i will, sadly there ain't."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"overwatch 2, as far as pvp is concerned, the same old song and dance. with a few new maps and game modes here and there, there isn't really much to rant and rave about. i'm disappointed that overwatch pve until early 2023, but that's how things go. i've played this game for almost a week now, and did my time in beta. pros it's the same overwatch experience, but with better role queue times. i don't have to wait an eternity if either i or a friend want to play one specific role. battlepass  lootbox system. it's pretty easy to level up in overwatch's battlepass system, so that shouldn't be a problem. also, the never ending barrage of duplicates got old pretty fast in ow1. now, the cons.... the store is horrendous. a legendary skin will run you around 2000 coins, aka 2o us dollars. emotes are about 5 dollars or more. and other miscellaneous items.. i'm getting ptsd of halo infinite's store. the challenges are pretty repetitive, and don't really offer much incentive to keep coming back. your reward is a couple bp levels and maybe 60 coins.... a week.....weeeeee. but hey, you save those coins and in a year's time, you could get a legendary skin! blizzard's servers are god awful during this time. even after the 2 day stretch of 40k queues and server logouts, it's still messing up. sometimes it'll say that you've never played overwatch even when the 1000 hours say otherwise, or you have no friends online when blizzard says there's several friends on overwatch. overwatch 2 had every chance to come out swinging after a year of disappointing releases from other aaa games. the hype was built up to the stars, only for it to plummet to earth. if you're an old player of overwatch, and are getting back into the swing, maybe the moment won't be tainted for you. but if you're a new player, and grinding for characters isn't your thing, then perhaps a different game is for you. using the excuse give it  and it'll get better doesn't excuse the fact that it feels like minimal thought and work was put into making an overwatch sequel. this feels more like an overhaul and a bad one at that."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,the state of this game is an absolute joke. they ruined it by trying to make it fastpaced. you have to be extremely lucky to get good tanks to win now. the new game mode is trash and not fun at all. i really hope this game dies off or they fix how greedy they are.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"sorry winston overwatch wont be back this game is turbo  this is not a sequel, damn this is not even an update. you released a downgraded version of the same game but with a lot of dono. you wanna hear whats actually wrong with this game? here you are terrible voice acting,  up servers, performance of the game, balance, maps, ranks, side change screen, text, post game menu,statistics menu, removed tank, half settings, 3 throwersleavers per single ranked game, you have to force yourself to play support. every single support main i knew moved to dps. you guys  up so bad, this is not even funny. you had 3  years to make a nice game but u  up, every single annual cod is better than ur 3 yo masterpiece. you had the power to make ow2 as exciting as the first one, i remember the old days when i was sitting at school and thinking about this cool new game and how i will play it when im home. nowadays i dont have these warm dreams to get off college earlier to play ow2. i forced myself to play for a full week this is my final day, as you can see journey ended not very good.  blizzard killed their own child and buried it at their backyard. gj blizzzzzzzzard im  speechless if someones wondering im on rly high end pc, i have around 1.5k hours in ow1, when the game was actually playable i was playing on tank."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"good great visuals and aesthetic. 5v5 feels faster and more exciting. new maps are welldesigned and feature numerous strategic avenues. push mode allows for some tense backandforth exchanges. the new heroes are fun to play. most of the new voice lines and interactions are well done. still feels good to control and offers great connectivity despite an initially shaky launch. bad some annoying bugs and challenges. audio mixing needs some work, especially when it comes to enemy footsteps. nonbattle pass progression feels hamstrung with little to no rewards to earn outside of the premium pass. amount of free premium currency is pitiable. ui still needs some work. thoughts in its current early access, overwatch 2 has a lot going for it. there are a lot of good things, especially for those who care about the core gameplay. but there are some negatives, whether its aspects of monetization, the ui, or progression. this is a new beginning, for better or worse. a lot hinges on the future pve content, how blizzard addresses and balancing concerns, whether future battle passes offer a decent slate of rewards, the appeal of limitedtime events, new heroes and maps, and much more. at this moment, it is fun, and a fresh new experience for me, fabled blizzard polish be damned. whether it remains that way is anyones guess."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"so i really should to finish challenges during 8 months to open one skin? i think even developers were not working so long for this ga... update. overwatch 2 missed all things we liked at first game rewards for best impact, free skins, interact with enemy team after match, loyal lootbokses. all game feels like somebody wants to f me even if i get it for free."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,1.   2.            3.    4.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"this game looks poor compared to other fps alternatives. it lacks any sense of progression, you don't get any meaningful rewards for winning matches. market prices and content they sell is just useless  cosmetics that nobody see cost money, its a joke. support classes are designed one shot, some classes are really awful and imbalanced, while other useless. i think blizzard need to reduce appetite for money and start thinking about quality of the product. they released this game so it can die faster. managers and game producers should find another job after failing such title."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"for how long it took him to come up this game. this game is pretty mild which is pretty bad. they got rid of a bunch of functions like grouping up and getting paint sprays for accomplishing achievements, which made the game a little bit more fun for casual players. and don't get me started on competitive. it's still a piece of work. nobody's on mic which made the group function great for finding groups of people that had mics. and cutting it down to 5e5 shows how lazy blizzard is and i will not be spending any more money on blizzard after this bs pulled!!!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"the new battlepass system is a steaming pile of garbage, when compared against the micro transaction free lootcratelootbox system which was used in overwatch original the account migration process is long and painful i am currently 630000 in the queue after waiting for 2 days the entire game is filled with micro transactions, and how could i forget? people who have bought the original overwatch game, will not receive the battlepass for free"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"played the game for a couple of hours now and i have to say the game feels like a terrible custom game where the damage is boosted to the point of absurdity. there are some changes that are fun like making zarya have bubble charges and sombra being more viable as a dps, but the whole thing comes at the cost  you paid 60 for. gone forever poof maybe it will get better with time but as it stands the game a is a dumpster fire."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,the scummiest free to play game i have ever seen. i was one of the ones defending ow for making this f2p because i have seen multiple examples of a free to play done well. if there was an ever an example for what a free to play should not be its this game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"some really nice improvements from overwatch 1 and a great new foundation im sure blizzard will build off of. however, there are quite a lot of bugs and the launch was rough with the queue times. there is also a relatively small amount of new content and updates given the time weve been waiting, but i do like all of the changes. overall a big improvement from overwatch 1 but could be a lot better, which im hoping comes true, especially when the new pve comes out."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"updating my review because it was overly optimistic and man, was i wrong. my favorite game has been desecrated, torn to shreds. i hate the direction of this game, the matchmaking, pricing, events, modes, balance, everything. they still aren't listening to the community enough and the updates and hotfixes take ages to occur. overall i've lost a lot of hope. this game is a shell of what it used to be."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i have over one thounsand hours on overwatch 1 so i think i speak with at least a little authority when i say that this game is just straight up lazy. do i think it deserves to be rated as low as it is now, no. there's still a good game burried under the mountain of issues i have with it. it took blizzard eight year, eight, to produce what most other developers call an update not a sequel. you can make the argument that changing it from 6v6 to 5v5 changes up the flow of the game and makes it feel somewhat fresh and the movement away from stun and cc with balancing has made the game infinitely more playable. but does this make it a warrented sequel, absolutely not. putting aside the terrible launch controversies with outrageous queue times and server issues, the game is still not very great. it borrows a lot from it's predescessor and doesn't really adapt it in any new or unique way. another issue i have with the game is that it completely absorbed overwatch 1 meaning that if you want to go back and experience the first game again, tough luck. knowing blizzard this is going to be turned into a ploy to resell the first game and call it a remaster but i digress. the game is also somehow more monitized than the first game. the first games lootboxes were pretty simple, you would level up once and be able to obtain one lootbox per level. if you played the game enough, you could unlock all the skins you wanted pretty easily. now, they've moved to a battlepass system except it is an incredibly skewed battlepass. in other games with a battlepass system like fortnite, you can obtain coins by completing the battle pass even without buying it that would allow you to buy things in the shop. however, in overwatch 2, there is none of that. instead, all of the skins are locked behind the premium battlepass so if you want any of the new skins but don't want to shovel any more money into an objectively evil company, tough luck. overall, a lazy game not deserving of the sequel title and was obviously called a sequel simply to generate hype to hopefully revive the dead franchise. unfortunately, does not seem like it worked for them."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"overwatch is my favorite online game of all time, this game aside from the predatory monetization doesn't capture the same magic that made overwatch special poor ui, looks unfinished in parts, server issues, poor monetization considering everything was free for 6 years some skins don't deserve to be 20. it's a shame because after six years of loving this game i feel my time with it is coming to an end due to some really poor executive decisions"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"i was pretty content with the ow1 system. i bought it during the initial release. you got lootboxes but you could buy whichever skin you wanted if you were diligent and saved enough coins. you werent forced to pay a cent, there was no illusion of items being obtainable for free. you could actually get them if you were dedicated to the game. now those same items from the old version and being resold at higher prices for no reason. just because they updated the game and slapped 2 on the cover. if i wanted to buy a skin in the old version i could get it with coins pretty reasonably just by playing the game every day. do you know how long it would take for me to get this skin now? 32 weeks. 60 coins a week. 8 months. for 1 skin. so now i suddently cant get the same skins from the old version. im actually being punished for playing in the new version instead of being incentivized to play it. less rewards from playing the same exact game. and i bought this game 8 years ago. you can make a new skin that costs 10000 dollars, i dont fing care. slapping 2 on the title doesnt give you the right to increase prices on the old content, gatekeeping it and making it virtually unobtainable without paying. nowdays games are supposed to either give you a reward with enough playing, or lock the reward behind a paywall making it unobtainable at all. its usually fine for cosmetic items, but why give the illusion that an item is actually obtainable by playing when its not? no one is going to play for 8 months to unlock a single legacy skin. people who would play the game regardless will keep playing it, people who would buy skins regardless will buy them, but the people who would grind for the free rewards that any game should have will just drop the game. i hope their shareholders will be happy with their next monetary failure, because i sure as hell am mad. i wanted to play, but im not going to them you one damn cent more"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"a piece of garbage that was released for profit. overwatch was a game that you came to play, enjoyed the gameplay and got new loot every week, there was a certain motivation to play. in those very moments when a legendary skin or an epic skin falls out of the case, you really experience some kind of pleasant feeling, like in some casino when you hit the jackpot, and it was always some kind of surprise effect, everyone was running with different skins. overwatch 2 is the same game with minor changes, in some cases even for the worse, for example, tanks, which are now almost impossible to destroy using the example of orisa and zarya. i also don't see a problem with adding 5x5 and 6x6 to the game because a lot of people don't like the new update. there is no motivation to play anymore because the game offers you nothing for playing it. i and millions of players believe that battlepass is garbage that all modern games earn from, but still some games are able to create a good battlepass, but, unfortunately, this is not about overwatch 2. there is no surprise effect, as it was before, anymore, you pay and just spend a lot of time in the game to open all the content. new players who buy battlepass will not have what we had in the first part, we are talking about originality, as mentioned above, different loot dropped out of containers to everyone. you can say, you can buy the skin you want for your money, why are you complaining here, but buying skins for 13 of the price of the game you once bought, the skins you got in the first part because you play and open cases, no thanks. conclusion blizzard is a moneyhungry company that replaced the game we once bought with a free, unambiguous garbage dump with pumping money out of players, the clown skin they gave to old players embodies them very well. p.s. return the old game we paid for, let the trash lovers continue to play this parody."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"this does not seem like a new game. it would have if the cooperative story mode came out with its release. instead, it feels like a significant update or an unfinished new game. the worst part of it is the microtransaction approach it takes, the battle pass. now, i would essentially buy a new 60 game every time i purchase three new skins. the battle pass tries to get people to buy it at the beginning rather than the end by promising a boost in battle pass experience. this is because blizzard knows that most people will not make it to the end of the battle pass in any case and will not get the best cosmetics. so, they try to get people to buy it impulsively or to commit all their free time to the game in hopes that they get the best cosmetics. i am not going to essentially rebuy the old game for new cosmetics. sure you get some free cosmetics through play but they are generally terrible and not something that anyone would care to have. there is very little reward for playing now. why play a game that does not reward time investment as it did in the past when you could play a game that does? if two games are both fun why not play the one that is also rewarding? overwatch 2 is dead to me since it is clearly a monetary black hole."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"to start with, on launch day you couldnt access the server for 2 days which was put down to ddos attacks. when you were eventually able to join the server you were kicked you out of competitive games. everything is monetised. everything. im fully behind supporting the game, however, when the game is released and there are so many issues and bugs  there is absolutely no incentive to support it. the legendary skins are meh and just rehashed versions of each other. if you do want to grind out battle pass items they take an absurdly long time and are quite honestly trash anyway. there are massive balance issues. orisa literally cannot be killed. stick a mercy pocket on her and she just absorbs damage all game long. zarya can use three bubbles on herself and instantly get 100 charge. while shields were an issue in overwatch, the single tank dynamic doesnt work in my opinion. characters like ana and zen are too vulnerable to the likes of long range dps like ashe or solider. the new interfaces look horrible, cheap and basic. for example, the leaderboards while in a game are uninformative and encourage toxicity. overwatch was always meant to be a team game, focusing on team work and not individualism. the partnership with activision has become immediately clear with a focus on things like leaderboards. my main gripe comes with many beloved features of overwatch 1 that seem to have went awol, namely being on fire and the board at the end  where you could vote for team mates or players you played against. i could go on and on, but overwatch cant even be considered a shadow of overwatch 1."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"overwatch 1 was designed with passion and good old gaming philosophy were you could unlock all the content by playing the game with great devs and people like papa jeff at the helm. yes loot boxes were kinda annoying but still at the end you could play the game and get everything with a gaming sense of progression and fun levelling system. the game was making good money too so don't buy in this  propaganda of activision blizzard that they had to make the game f2p. the prices in the shop are absolutely insane for a video game, ii's looking more and more like a mix of gacha game and  f2p mobile games. 20 eurodollar for a skin that is basically the same model with a different jacket, with that amount of money you can buy your friends that may struggle with money a good complete game for cheap using discounts. insanity. blizzard went insane. the battle pass make the game feels like a job because of fomo, also the rewards are so disgusting even with the premium one, when in past games you would get all the content by just buying the games once. live services games should release big amount of content yearly and price it 3040 dollars or something or use a sub model, the only healthy models for games i know are those, wow and ffxiv specifically work great like that. this game lost its soul. a complete dowgrade, many features that made it a cool game, like medals, cards, on fire animations, polish in the ui, ask people to group after a match and many many other cool stuff were removed and botched, there are white pixels on the edges of the characters icons in game... new heroes animations are lazy and uninspired, and some of them are awkward to watch during the play of the games. blizzard is dead. gaming is becoming worse and worse, beloved companies are abandoning the passion and art for quick cash grab and brainwashing younger generations with awful greedy monetization practice that belongs to predatory capitalism not game developers that ask fair prices to deliver to you all the content, while making us passionate seasoned gamers long for the golden times of 80' to apx 20072010. i quit, i give up, i will treasure all the characters and cool moments with me and say thank you to jeff and all the passionate devs that worked on ow1 and old blizzard, that had various issues but at least they were passionate game developers without being controlled by greedy disgusting humans. stay away from ow2 if you truly believe in healthy and passion driven gaming with fair monetization."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,please let blizzard pay for this. the game is a glorified money guzzler. free to play ha we bought overwatch but now those are just drunk coasters. the rough launch made this unbearable with huge queue times and disconnects but also theyve thrown away the mmr system. new players being thrown against 1k  players is slowly going to dwindle this game to nothing followed by the ridiculous ask of dailies and more enough idiotic weekly challenges as the rewards are less for more you do. im not good at this game and believe i only had about 300 hours in original overwatch but when i was being pitted against players with those of hours making the game board line unplayable. oh but its free why are you complaining? cause i bought the first one heard the ridiculous ask for players that never played overwatch to unlock original characters and game modes. the battle pass with more tiers then days to complete even when there game was impossible to play at start. the only redeeming thing they did was the phone number check to stop smurfs from bulling baby players. except they just put you with everyone and say deal with it were blizzard f you
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-10,"it's overwatch 1, but with a few really important changes that make the game actually palatable instead of the shieldandstunfest of the previous iteration. 5v5 is far, far superior to the previous 6v6 gameplay, and it feels like the balance overall has been ironed out. it's actually fun now! all of these 012 reviews are your typical review bombs. also, almost all of those people are playing the game 5 hours a day still, despite the the skins and microtransactions are pretty bad, but i never spend money on any of that, so who cares. if you want a hero shooter, there really isn't a better option than this one. or valorant, if you're into cs. both are good options."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,wtf are these servers and queue times. games just a washed out version of what it was before
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"garbage. the new player system is a total mess. it sees my account as new, so i'm locked out of all the heroes and game modes. i can't play competitive so i'm stuck in unranked with actual new players who have no idea what they're doing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,the monetization it's a joke. blizzard being blizzard ah...................
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,removed my paid game and introduced this corporate nightmare battle pass garbage. basically turned ow1 in overwatch immortal monetization wise. please save your time and money for any other decent project.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"this game has one of the worst battle passes i've ever seen, with only 80 bp levels and at bp level you finally get to access the new hero. yes, they are locking heroes behind a bp or a ridiculous amount of playtime. something like 80 hours if i remember correctly. not only did they get rid of overwatch 1 in favor of this early access game, they removed features and, while graphically beautiful, the ui is an absolute mess. most games allow you to see if your low health by a red graphic that comes up on the edges of the screen. overwatch 1 did it, ow2 does not. the game that was touted as the pve version of overwatch, with a lot of ingame lore, story missions, hero levels and skill trees, not even there yet. they ceased production on overwatch 1 so they could focus on overwatch 2, they weren't making the amount of money they wanted, so they said oh, we need money. lets get rid of overwatch 1 and only have overwatch 2 early access available, this way we can bombard the player base with the worst battle pass ever that doesn't award ingame currency so if they want skins, they have to pay money or grind for months in order to get a skin. oh yeah, lets not forget that the skins we have in the battlepass are pretty bad except for the mythic skin at max level. i'm sure they'll enjoy it. word of warning, even thought most people know this. this company has lost its vision for overwatch as a teambased hero shooter. it is now a deathmatch with secondary objectives. most of the original developers have left the company and the game is now under a new vision. that vision being . they do not care for their playerbase or for their game. there is no passion here anymore. if you want a deathmatch game then this game is for you. the gameplay is relatively fun, even thought most of the hero roster needs to be tuned. it plays well and there is a faster ttk for everything below 250 health. oneshots exist, not only from dps but from one of the tanks and the game rewards quick feet sometimes. 110 for the visuals."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,nobody wants a battle pass system. i'm tired of companies fomo pressuring their users like they don't deserve better. just sell the game once and give us access to grind out all contents like in ow1.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"cant speak for how it compares to recent overwatch 1, but as someone who stopped playing around 3 years ago, this game is not worth your time. role queue still , some characters are basically ruined fun wise due to changes, the new players are terrible since the game has gone f2p, microtransactions everywhere. this is not a new game, in fact, this is overwatch 0.5 because despite numerous improvements, there are just way too many problems introduced with the changes. if you've never played overwatch before, it is worth a try, but for anybody coming back, this is definitely not worth a millisecond of your time."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"this game is so disappointing. i held onto hope even when all the evidence urged me not to. even aside from the absolute predatory antiplayer garbage that is blizzard's new monetization scheme and the awful state of the launch servers, the game itself is somehow worse than it's predecessor during the worst content drought. the ui is terrible, the graphics and sound design lost character. the realistic gunshots make the different characters less distinguishable. match making is awful. support is awful to play now and tank and dps ques are still too long. it sure feels like overwatch 1 but worse and run by a team of villains."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"haters gonna hate. overwatch 2 no  o mesmo jogo,  uma evoluo perfeita do primeiro jogo,  agora o que sempre devia ter sido, muito divertido de jogar, muita coisa nova, com alguns problemas de lanamento, sim, mas  s ter pacincia, no conheo um jogo que no tenha enfrentando o mesmo em seus lanamentos, como fall guys e new world..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"game play feels fresh and fun, but literally everything else has been a downgrade. a content patch should not be considered version 2.0 of the game, especially since core features like 1. server stability and being able to login 2. player progression levels 3. players who previously paid for ow1 are no longer able to get content they paid for 4. a ton of maps are gone people complained about 2cp, but some of them were fun   5. idk a ton of things are gone so that blizzard can charge us more money i was really excited about the game finally getting an update, but to call this a sequel is laughable. there aren't enough significant changes from ow1 to call it a sequel."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"this game actually took a leap backwards from ow1. i've put many hours in this past weekend and i've come to conclusion that there is literally zero feeling of progression. there is zero feeling of reward for any aspect of the game. the rank system now is absolutely the worst rank system in a video game i have ever played. honestly, i cannot play rank in this game with its current setup. and i can't play quick play with how boring an dry it feels after every match. the battlepass is has nothing of value in it, the skins are not even considered mediocre, they are terrible looking. the rest of the  thrown in the battlepass is pointless. and i mean literally pointless. there's no current in the battlepass either. this game feels like a fraction of what ow1 was. how the  does that make any sense"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"it was said that overwatch 2 will be a seperate game with a pve focus, after launch there is no pve options at all, it is also not a separate game, and it replaced overwatch 1 which had a pvp focus it is the same content the only difference being slight balance adjustments and 12 new heroes and 3 new maps and a few new modes, the big difference is also that now the content from the previous game you had access to is now monetized stronger than before basically locking you out of obtaining it without spending more money to give a perspective there are 32 characters in overwatch if you want a skin for each character it would cost you around 20 per skin which would mean you would have to pay 640 to have 1 skin for every character. which is extremely steep considering the previous title the new updated game has launched as a free to play title which is the reason why there are these steep prices, and it is not hard to see where the focus is. it doesn't feel like a new game, and it doesn't seem like a new game it feels like an update for overwatch 1 with fewer features and more monetization things like leveling were taken out of the game just like in game stat cards at the end of a match, it feels like a simplified version which sole reason was to have as much monetization as possible."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,amazing.great gameplay and maps all the characters are fun and unique to play totally worth it and plus its free yes it has some microtransactions but you dont need them to play the game
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,predatory battle pass don't spend a cent! game feels more or less like ow1 but microtransactions baked in from the get go.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"trash fire , all the story is gone and the 20 skins are basically default. it has half the promised content and has taken away every leveling system except the battle pass."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,blizzard somehow found a way to make a worst copy of overwatch 1. they ended overwatch 1 to make people pay for their battle pass and this game just feels like a money grab. blizzard didn't want to make a good game rather just wanted the players' money.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"overwatch 1 is that hot girl you've been hooking up with for a while and it's great. overwatch 2 is that same girl, but this time she drugs you, ties you up, and makes you eat your own ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"it's actually very good. the servers are fixed. already. the items and cosmetics not being there problem already fixed. and i'm level 20 on the battle pass after just 5 days. people that are hating on this game fall into two campsthe people that either don't freaking play the game, which is most of you. and then the people that played the first one till they got sick of it and quit. and all of you are getting your information from youtubers because you all sound like yongyea with bad grammar. heck he was still reporting problems that have been fixed as still a problem. whatever. doesn't matter. even though i hate blizzard. they nailed this. and the over 500k that were combining their accounts just today also like it. and the people that were logged off that play it like it. if you don't like it and play it you're in the minority. if you don't play it and don't like it, you look silly."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,why would they change the ranked system? the new ranking system is literally garbage.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"as a prior overwatch player, this game, overwatch 2 does a fan service in the game play department. 5v5 is a wonderful experience and adds a moment to moment aspect to overwatch that makes every match enjoyable to the end. on top of it, the new push game mode is a blast and adds a new unique experience that is easily just as enjoyable as the other modes in the game. not to mention the new maps and the 3 unique heroes that are amazingly fun to play, you must have a great game, right? sadly this is where all the good things end. the game launched a buggy mess and the fact that on top of the bugs and everything, we get hit with a predatory micro transactions and battle pass system that doesnt work well with most people and their wallets. they removed things like the on fire system that complements the player for being good, the leveling system that gave people a goal and reason to keep playing, the card system which boosted peoples confidence when they play a good game, and the find a group feature. but lets also not forget what they make new players go through to even play any of the characters in the game. it is just purely sickening. in short, the game is fun and a great time, but with the bugs, the lack of content, predatory business actions towards the user, and the utter lack of care of the fan base, the game is easily a 6 out of 10. it has potential to be better and higher, but blizzard need to wake up and look at what made the original overwatch so popular. or else we may see a dead game by the time they decide to launch the pve mode."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"this game is nothing like ow 1.... game is stale and hollow. doesn't have the love or passion put into it. was made for one thing, the battle pass system and store.. there's bugs everywhere, the amount of it isn't even acceptable for a new game. definitely not your typical polished blizzard game.."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"i want to make this short. this game isnt a sequel at all, its just a glorified update with no progression system but a brandnew monetization model and an in game store. in order to have some progression and earn stuff since there arent levels anymore for the time you spent on the game mostly suffering other players, you will be filling a xp bar to complete a battle pass that you need to pay to gain access to a premium battle pass with no really premium rewards, even after paying you need to heavily grind it. this is easily one of the biggest scams in video games history. in most of the games with a bp, if you manage to complete it, it rewards you back the complete cost of the bp itself though the levels, but thats not the case, here you can have some ridiculous rewards as premium graffitis, voice lines, player icon, banners or the brandnew souvenirs that no one likes. thats not the only issue with the game, but its my main concern as an original ow player. this game gets very boring so fast since there's no progression, there's no point on continue playing anymore. free to play doesnt mean you can abuse your users like that. we wont support future overwatch leagues and their sponsors."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"overwatch 2 is more like overwatch 1.3, it has everything overwatch 1 had and more but not in a good way. they have only added 3 new characters, and 2 new maps as well as 1 new game mode not including custom games. so for how long it took them to come out with this while abanding the first 1, there is very little new content. there is also terrible lag, and color changes to the ui and some map color changes turn the orange colors way too warm creating these disgusting oranges and reds, the new kda scoreboard is horrible, they replaced loot boxes with a battle pass which on its own would not be bad but they added all the stuff out of the old game into a store, where all the old free content is paywalled for like 20 bucks or more. there are challenges now to let u progress through hero acquisition and battle pass credits but hero challenges are broken and seem to be slow going as you have to complete weekly challenges to get the paid currency but you have to complete 4 challanges to get 3040 paid currency when 1600 currency adds up to 16 dollars. u have to play years before u get any closer to getting any of the currency to buy stuff, even loot boxes were a better mechanic than this. halo also implemented a battle pass system where u can go to a previous battle pass that u have bought to get items u have missed if u bought that battle pass this needs to be a new standard in battle passes this way u don't miss out on content u have spent money on just because u could't play enough. they came up with a new thing called overhealth which i don't understand, it's like shieldsarmor but prevents 20 ult recovery or something to that effect but they basically added it to replace things like orisa's drop shield so there wasn't shield comps anymore but it feels like they are just mitigating peel comps now, and with the new 5v5 it seems like dps can never do enough damage, and healers are harder to protect because u've got the dps trying to do enogh damage while the healers are way too split between healing and trying to do enough damage to refill there health gain abilities back, all while dps can't protect the back line. role queue, the thing that was supposed to save overwatch is now dead, the queues for this game mode are dead, i've spent hours in the queue waiting for role but as soon as i switch to open queue instant matches. the characters are supposed to be free for anyone who had overwatch 1 but is locked atm because  or so i've been told by a friend. non of the character reworks are terrible but at the same time a lot of the heroes haven't been touched which is wierd if u ask me, if ur adding new content like heroes and maps they should always be tweeked at least a little. and they tweeked reins turn on his dash for the better but for something they couldn't change in the first 1 because of tech limitations, they sure have a lot of the same issues for it being a tech upgraded game. it feels like they are the same old engine or that's it's too much like the old one to feel like the changed it at all. it just feels like a 10 yr old game with some new paint on it, but the paint has been sitting there for years so it looks disgusting this game is not bad, but for it being a new upgraded game it doesn't feel new enough it's like going from fallout 3new vegas to fallout 76 almost"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,this game is so bad that i made an actual friend in real life instead of playing this... thing. wanna buy some good ol' skins? how about spending real money! now that is a really good idea that everyone will love.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"this isn't a new game, its a sad excuse for a sequel. a graphics update and 4 less heros than we should have. and the pve they are releasing could have easily been a dlc for overwatch 1 but they remade the whole game and turned into a money void because a skin that used to be free now costs you 20 dollars and they didn't even bother to put any currency in the battle pass because thats to much for this small multi million dollar indie company. in short they remade overwatch but with less effort and more ways to spend money. this is a sad excuse for a second game"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"same old game, same old actiblizzion tactics. loot boxes may be gone, but in it's place is a rather disappointing take on a battle pass system. it is grindy, it incentivizes you away from playing the classes or characters you actually want to play gotta get that xp, and it tries to pull you in on its daily schedule. not to mention the gameplay at the moment feels haphazard at best and poorly thought out. the new push mode doesn't feel rewarding to play in the slightest, even if you win, some characters still vastly out perform others, and a common complaint i have heard is people aren't able to play what they want to play, be it role or character. this game seems to almost deincentivize fun. i play games to relax. to have fun. i should be able to hop on it when i want without feeling punished for it. i should have the urge to return to it because i enjoyed it, not because for a fear of missing out on one more day of tedious grind. i should be able to have fun without worrying about my wallet. garbage game. don't waste your time with it."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"cheap mobile copy of good old overwatch. goodnight sweet prince, you will be missed and remembered."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,another trash game that was unfinished at release by blizzard when they had nothing but time to not screw it up. this multi billion dollar company now feels like a indie company and is no where near as great as it used to be.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,this game is an amazing sequel to the original the mechanics and changes are great and widely heard additions from the complaints of overwatch 1 the addition of the battle pass give a much greater incentive to play the lesser favorite healer and random role queue positions for the players that wanna grind the game put and there are minimal game bugs for a fresh online game compared to many other games most of the issues are due to the under estimated player base i feel all and all very please and am very excited for all the additions to come!

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"game is fine, they fine tuned the gameplay of overwatch and its quite fun. new content is minimal, a few maps and heroes. but what apparently makes overwatch 2 a true sequel is the new live service business model it's packaged in, with a grindy bloated mess of a reward system that manages the incredible feat of being more exploitative than the lootboxdriven one that preceded it. get ready to barely crawl along the brand new battle pass designed to make you feel poor. it's an experience that's fundamentally hostile to the player."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"absolute trash of a replacement to the original overwatch, and i'll tell you why. first, i'll be nice and commend what i like some new skins. now to mention everything they've removed and changed  removed player levels. no longer personal levels for your account to show off with. all experience goes to the damned 'battle pass', because everybody and their mother have to have a god damn battle pass in their game now.  removed medals while in a game. replaced with a generic stat screen, so everybody can see everybody's stats at all times, and immediately flame the correct person for doing poorly.  removed the on fire feature. replaced with nothing.  made everybody more squishy. everybody dies in a moment, if you aren't paying attention for a nanosecond.  removed orisa's shield. replaced with a spear???. reinhardt's shield was further nerfed, from it's original 2000 hp, to 1600 hp, to now being 1200 hp.  removed 1 tank slot, so both teams max consist of 5 players, 1 being a tank. this kept in mind with the 2 above mentioned nerfs to at least 2 tanks, means the game is way more exposed than in ow1, making the squishy issue worse.  made moira's damage orb even more damagey. if you didn't like one of your healers being damageonly, i have bad news for you.  removed bastions repair function. replaced with a grenade. also, made his gatling gun turret mode have a 12 second cooldown. this only mentioned, because what's bastion good for now, if he can't even turret mode. just a slightly different solder76.  removed lootboxes. replaced with dailyweekly queststasks, that are tedious at best, and only designed to make you spend even longer in the game, and god knows they need it, as they need a big, sirupdrenched carrot to keep you playing this mess. conclusion bring back ow1 and stop trying go rip people off with microtransactions, blizzard."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"overwatch 2 requiring a phone number linked to account sets an unacceptable precedent for the future of online gaming. this game is free to play yet decides whether your phone carrier is up to their standards or not. this game actually costs hundreds of dollars a year to play and is replacing a game many people including myself already paid for. that's without getting into the myriad of other reasons no one should ever support activision blizzard cosby suite, blitzchung incident and general free speech suppression."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,want to spend more time staring at a finding game screen rather than actually playing the game itself? then this is the game for you. you will be spending over 30 minutes looking for a match and the match itself will only be about 510 minutes long.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"the only issue w the game right now are a few minor bugs, aggressive monetization and some balancing issues. the game itself is amazing but i can see why it is being review bombed. i am confident blizzard will address these issues. if not ill change my review"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"it feels like a clone of ow1 with only a few hero kit tweaks for some. kiriko is fun as a support hero, sojurn i could take or leave as a dps, and junker queen felt great as a tank. nothing against the game play itself. it just doesn't feel like a leap forward and more like a patch to ow1. thats the good. what really made me give a negative score, it's the monetization push. getting greeted with the get the premium battlepass on almost every screen ruined the experience and i immediately uninstalled after a single quick play match. almost everything is locked behind the premium paid option, where ow1 you could earn everything through in game currency. the lootboxes , but you weren't compelled to buy them as you had ways to earn them just by playing. this felt like they want you to buy passes over and over to get the sprays, emotes, and skins. i might revise this with pve story when it comes out. but as it stands right now, it's at best a mediocre f2p clone of fortniteow1. i get the need to fund on going development, but this is not garnering good will back."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"although overwatch 1 was not perfect, they took a really great model  and took away the power and control of the player away. in ow1 the player had the ability of getting to choose what items to purchase for the heroes you actually played with. i didn't even mind getting duplicates because i could earn coin too save up and buy a legendary skin. but with the battle pass model it took away the players freedom of choice and forced to earn unwanted items ithat were payed for with actual money. i feel robbed and will not be buying future battlepasses. also the 5v5 model feels so much worse than the 6v6 and the changes to some of the characters are unwelcomed and not a step forward. the game just feels so foreign, ow1 was like a prized pig and ow2 is lipstick on a boar. i wish we had the ability to choose between playing ow1 and ow2. blizzard you  up, screwed the pooch,  the bed, etc. etc. all for greed. one legendary skin per battlepass? for a hero you don't even main does not make me want to grind and weekly challenges are another bad idea. i was a daily ow1 player, it was my main game, now i can't think of one saving grace at this point because the negative outweighs any positive by so much."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"blizzard is at it again, another fail release where the developer interferes with gameplay. if you are not woke in their eyes, they will harass you and cheat against you. this generations bane of the liberal tech industry is game developers like blizzard that harass players in their own games and pretend they are accomplishing something other than making themselves liable for criminal harassment charges and lawsuits."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"promised it would be free, then charged for battle passes and locked characters behind monetization league of legends style. they're also breaking the older characters mei, cass, moira so that people are more likely to buy the new ones. i'd buy ow1 again to play it on the old servers, but after a few days of trying to enjoy this turd i'm out."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"like overwatch 1, but worse. there is no fun to be had anymore. even in games where i won, i never had any fun. the 5v5 encourages sweaty playing so i cant even enjoy myself. i truly feel like this game has been ruined."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"the state of micro transactions in the game is horrendous. in overwatch 1 which they've made impossible to play now you could earn cosmetic items for free within a day. in overwatch 2, the current system has it so that you can only earn a select few of them, and even those take months to actually earn enough 'coins' to buy. approximately 8 months. otherwise enjoy paying up to 20 dollars for a single skin."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,gameplay wise its alright but they have completely ruined everything else. paying 20 for a skin you could get for free 2 weeks ago. locking heroes behind the battlepass. i cant believe im gonna say this but i miss loot boxes. this game should have never existed.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,it's literally worst overwatch i can imagine.i buyed overwatch1 and playing very long time. but this one is realy bad
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,they took an amazing game and ruined it in every way imaginable. its quite impressive when you think about it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"the game is still fun when you get to play it, but sadly the monetization is catering towards whales, not normal people. sad to see so many games go this route. it's like they ripped the soul right out of the game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"i bought ow2 many years ago and been playing with friends on and off. unfortunately couldn't play the game anymore as it didn't like my phone thanks for destroying the game, now i can go back to league"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"day 1 overwatch 1 player here. 6v6, teamplay, balance, server stability  all gone. overwatch 2 is a blatant cash grab, scam and a disgrace. they can't even get the sound mix right. can't hear footsteps through all of the new gun sounds, but hey  on the other hand  the ultimates are blasting your ears off. this game is a joke. i would give it a negative score if i could. the games are even more susceptible to steam rolling. tanks are god tier meanwhile some other heroes are a complete trash. quick play matchmaking puts veterans with newbies so it's the most frutrating experience you can imagine. to add to this  try to live through a queue that lasts up to an hour to even get to the menu."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"game is really great fun, i think lots of the changes made to the game work really well and i definitely foresee the game getting better over time now that it's live service. i think the ui is sleeker, and i don't find myself missing much of what was removed. i like a lot of the moves they made in the name of antitoxicity. overall, i think the game's great despite the rocky launch process. blizzard did a good job, to me, of addressing the problems and getting them fixed in a rather timely manner. i think most of the negative reaction to the game is a bunch of gamers who don't like change. as someone who didn't particularly enjoy overwatch 1 from the start, ow2 is a refreshing change with many features i enjoy. can't wait for pve to drop eventually, which is sure to bring a new player base and renewed interest to the game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"honestly i used to love overwatch as a game, the launch was massive, the overall atmosphere was great but it cannot be said about overwatch 2. it's not even a proper sequel and the number after it is mostly a joke. blizzard promised to add with this release a pve coop campaign and they didn't deliver it on start, not even mentioning server problems. fundamentally it's still a decent game mostly because of the gameplay from the first release of the game, gameplay is decent, heroes as charmfull as they used to be. but unfortunately it fails to deliver what it promised, it's just a a decent game ridden with awful microtransactions, like playable characters hidden behind a battle pass and overpriced skins. to sum up, dear blizzard, adding few new maps, one gamemode and 4 characters to the game is not a sequel it's just a little dlc at best, that really lacks content, for game like overwatch, this whole game should be a free update to first overwatch in the first place..."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"i love overwatch, it's definitely one of my favorite online multiplayer games out there. overwatch 2 is essentially a free update, with additional heroes, new abilities, new maps and a couple of quality of life improvements. the problem is, the game still has the exact same issues it used to have, and the new progression system is flawed and confusing. while being marketed as a sequel, it doesn't feel like a sequel at all, which is slightly disappointing. that being said, the game is still a lot of fun, it's quite literally the same game as before but with some additional content, and it's also free, so i can't complain, it's just not really worthy of the sequel title. final rating great  810."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"what a garbage product... free to play really blizzard? what a joke... no changes, no graphic improvements,balance is still no existing! i played 800 hours in ow1 and after all time i spend in this game, i have ow2 really?! that's so sad!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"it just feels like a patch to ow 1. stuff is way overpriced. there a free way of getting stuff but it takes a lot of time, even if you are paying. i do not want to feel like i work for the game i just want to have fun. new heroes blocked in the battle pass are just a bad decision. i know all companies focus the money, and is fine, however blizzard crossed the line here."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"they ruined the balance, took away the abilities of our favorite characters. took away the first part, gave a completely different game instead! thieves!"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,worst game ever made. this is not overwatch 2 more like overwatch 0.7 by the downgrade from 1 or more likely overpay 0.7 lets say that ea wont take the most hated company this year.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"they took overwatch, removed a lot of quality of life things like on fire notifications, removal of showing if people are on a team, medals, messed with endorsements etc. added preditory monitisation added in a ton of bugs to the game like you get an achievement you get kicked, server crashes and it counts as you leaving the game giving you penalties. on overwatch one you could get 50 lootboxes for 40, that would give three bonus lootboxes with guaranteed legendery skins, sometimes they had multiple then in those 50 lootboxes on average you would get 25 legendery skins and a load of epic skins, emotes etc. now for 40 you can get 2 legendery skins... as for gameplay its still kinda fun but with the lack of cc, removal of the second tank and the completely messed up matchmaking not giving one team a 5th player... its a massive step back from overwatch one that should never have happened."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"the same game with a new and improved, predatory, and disgusting monetization!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"give me back my overwatch 1 game which i bought. i don't want to play this cash grabbing sequel which feels like only an update. couldn't even login for the first 3 days, then eventually it worked but i get random server disconnects which results in a cooldown afterwards as it was my fault. i haven't even received the founders pack even though i owned overwatch for 2 years and have been constantly playing."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"a very big disappointing game. instead of improving the old game, they decided to do a sequel that no one ask."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"terrible sequel. gameplay dissuades teamwork and encourages dps to carry while leaving the healers to die. want a good skin? 20 want to rank in comp with friends? all four of us played open queue together for the qualifying rounds 1 gold 4 2 bronze 1 1 bronze 4 all this while you may not be able to invite friends due to different versions of overwatch... then you can't play because your character lost their glasses... then you randomly get disconnected... but! you can play the new hero! immediately if you pay, or in a few weeks if you want to play for free and grind through the battle pass. none of this happened in the beta  and those of us who paid for the original can no longer play the good version, and get nothing other than the new hero for our trouble."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,nothing new! totally nothing new! horrible battle pass system. this will be spending money for nothing
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"5v5 is not fun, overwatch has become a generic fps and not a strategical hero game with tanks, support and dps. it feels really, really dullboring. such a shame as i loved ow1 and no longer have access to it. oh well, didn't expect anything less from blizzard tbh. awful company and awful game. 00"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"overwatch 2 the game they shouldn't have here's a list of bad things ow2 has already done sms guarding its own playerbase lack of protection against ddos attacks adding micro transactions lowering graphics quality adding a battlepass system going against its own original design requiring phone numbers for new accounts calling itself a sequel when its, at best, a downgrade making free to play rewards virtually worthless forcefully ejecting a playerbase from ow1 not giving everyone their assets from ow1 taking away anyone's ability to stay on ow1 here's the one good thing its free"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,"all is ok, new dante sistem is better than random in cases. new heroes interesting, new maps are cool. ow1 is died, i can understand devs. all is ok, guys, its the same game, just with 2 on logo"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-09,the number 2 in the name is only to change the monetization system in which you need to grind what you could get before for free without grinding.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"they took a good game and made it worse. the new monetisation is worse than what we had before, grinding for 8 months for a skin is absurd, most hero reworks are less fun to play than before, and now the game crashes constantly and takes the best part of an hour to get past the stupid queue. i want to play the game i paid for again. bring back overwatch 1."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"5v5 game play removing one of the tanks completely changes the balance of the game. the ttk time to kill has been dramatically reduce, and every character has had a movement speed boost, resulting in a very frantic style of gameplay  a far cry from the team based tank, dps, and support system that used to exist in the 6v6 setup. the interface has removed ow1 players prestige icons, removed the ability to continue working toward them, so if you were an ow1 player with a gold or diamond portrait icon, we'll never know. the gameplay doesn't feel anything like ow1, and instead feels more like apex or valorant, which is fine, but not what drew many players to this team centric fps. oh, and the pve doesn't exist. maybe we'll see that in ow3."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"everyone who whines about donating, not donating, the game has excellent gameplay and it is possible to enjoy it without donating"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"i've been playing ow almost since the first week it came out, bought the most expensive edition there is, and been playing it for six consecutive years pretty much daily. i gotta say, ow 2 is the most cashgrab  game i've seen in my life. this game shoots weirdly, the server lags as hell is full of bugs, and all kinds of unbalance. this is nothing more than a giant patch that is going backward, probably done by people that don't play overwatch, and is unprofessional as hell. what a disgusting move. stay away just go play something else, r6, apex, have cash grabs too but at least its a more gameplay, this is a pile steaming garbage"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"blizzard removed everything that made the game fun and added a horrible battle pass system. without the lootboxes, youre forced to spend money or practically get nothing. many fan favorite maps were removed as well as a game mode. the battle pass is slow and costs money while also keeping new characters locked until you reach a high enough tier. getting enough in game currency for a single legendary skin without paying money takes at least eight months. buying legendary skins isnt a good option either seeing as each legendary skin costs 20. they removed many positive community features such as voting best player at the end of a match and endorsing opponents. i also have had multiple bugs that interfered with game play. for example, one game i had a bug where a choke point was filled with a black mass of triangles jutting out in all directions. i could walk through it but couldnt see anything. all of this is only an issue if you can even get into the game though. it took me anywhere between 13 hours just to get in the few times i played. i loved overwatch but overwatch 2 is unplayable for me. im immensely upset with blizzard for ruining such a beloved game while also essentially deleting the original."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"overwatch queue did you like playing dps before? well, now you can have the same experience immediately upon booting up the game! i don't buy the ddos excuse for a moment. i'm not going to say it's not a possibility, but i think it's an improbability. first off, they have the exact same problem with every game release  wow expansion i've played and yet... this is the first time it's coupled with a fairly negative user experience they can shift the conversation away from. ddos would not break things like your inability to team up ingame when you do actually beat the queue. they simply either didn't expect the flood of interest in the game, or they do not want to ramp up server space enough to meet it the game is essentially launching in maintenance mode, like the original overwatch did. excuse me, coming into early access in maintenance mode. they stopped an actual game that players paid for in favor of an early access f2p game. i should clarify that the queue time to log into the game  supposed ddos is a curiosity and doesn't influence my score in the slighest the game is just that bad. meat and potatoes the gameplay. it's overwatch but worse. the removal of a player might lend itself to shorter queue times as nobody wanted to play tank, but they didn't address why nobody wanted to play tank, and in fact, leaned into exactly why nobody wanted to play tank. they have been looking at game balance from the perspective of the dps players, the most popular role by far after all, if every match is waiting on the tank spots to fill up and you're needing to wait 15 minutes to play as a dps, there's a lot of those players in the game. again, instead of making a better experience for the tank players, they've attempted to make tank gameplay appeal to dps turning it into a dps and not a tank. similarly with healers, the latest healers can deal respectable damage, and are often played that way first and foremost. kiriko, the newest support is no exception, capable of dealing absurd damage but with subpar healing potential. my point is this is turning overwatch more into a game like valorant, which is already better at being valorant than overwatch could ever hope to be. and, you know, it already exists. people will tell you that tanks and healers have no point until they aren't getting protected or healed and then where's the shield? or where's the heals?  there's a reason these dps players still stick around. because overwatch, with role diversity, is actually a pretty cool formula. people just get a bit tired of being bullied to no end on any role besides dps, when you basically can't do anything but rely on your team for help. no surprise everyone wants their chance to just frag out and treat the objectivebased team game as a dm. even though dm exists as a mode... again, this dpsification has lead to faster playerdown times and each team has less meat on it than it did before, as they're incapable of buffing each individual tank to the level required to make up for a lack of two tanks. zarya being a great example of how poorly they've balanced the game you now have two charges of bubbles, shared for each bubble. you can bubble yourself twice!  until you've used both charges, then between them, one charge comes back as fast as an individual bubble did before. so, in the grand scheme of things, zarya has half the bubble potential in an extended fight. and you're the only tank. at least you do more damage.. the battle pass it's really bad. i'm not even aggressively against monetization but... two battle pass levels now was one level before which gave you a loot box. also, you got loot boxes for all manner of things. a loot box had 4 things, rolled by rarity, guaranteed to not be a dupe until you'd gotten all things of that rarity. instead of one loot box with 4 rolls, you might get 2 things depending on the specific levels. if you did not buy the battle pass, you get essentially nothing, as the free rewards are spread very, very thin. in the grand scheme of things, there is a lot less content added to the game, and that content you must now purchase with no real capability of playing to earn  the avenues of free currency and rewards are extremely limited. it doesn't seem like it's impossible to get the hero but there's less content. objectivebased challenges are also very bad for the health of the game. getting the competitive ones is going to be a huge grind, so you're absolutely going to have games where somebody picks a character they don't really want to be on just so they can rack up that one specific stat they need for the battle pass. i'm all for letting people play what they want  don't want to be the meta character junker queen because she can't rack up mitigation? okay. well, if you do want to be her, and you aren't, so that you can mitigate damage as a hero you don't otherwise want to be? that's a problem"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"matchmaker is bad and the battle pass is the highest form of greed. the new devs did not keep to what made the game a success. everyone is now a dps and the game feels like a death match. if you are support main, youre really out of luck if youre not pro level players."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,",  f2p .... 20      ??"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"overwatch 2 opens by demanding you hand over your sms number for your protection  it comes across as a threat. blizzard have had the ability to hardware ban players for years, so it seems disingenuous, and prevents many people from being able to play at all. provide that, and you move to a cinematic, but... unlike the beautifully rendered big screen experiences we've come to love with overwatch, it's a couple quick ingame shots and voice lines, the same vod as the advert for the game they're pushing everywhere... with four years of development it's a little disappointing and a harbinger of what's to come. finish this, the next thing you encounter is a full screen popup advertising the battle pass... so let's start there. ow1 had lootboxes, yes, but much of the player community was pretty happy with them  play a few games each week and you could easily unlock every cosmetic item in the game, and players who played less had the option of spending a little money to unlock anything you didn't want to grind for. ow2 has a battle pass, it costs you 10 every 9 weeks and it's mostly full of garbage. most tiers are voice lines or icons, or tiny charms that hang off your weapon that can't be seen in game. 75 of the battle pass items are premium only, and the free items are mostly trash, with a small number of recolour skins. heroes are locked 23 into the battle pass unless you pay premium items cannot be earned through gameplay, you have to pay. the battle pass is the only form of progression, unlocking a new threshold brings up large notifications in the main menu, which require you to enter the battle pass and look at the premium items to clear. for a free player, 75 of the time this entails going to look at a new unlock that you don't even have. the battle pass has 80 tiers, and each tier requires 10k xp to clear  a match earns about 500xp, so if you were to try and clear 80 tiers of the battle pass through matches alone, you would need to complete 1600 matches, or about 18 matches every day. you can of course clear levels more quickly by doing daily challenges that rotate each day  these provide up to 9000 xp per day and typically require about 5 matches. it's clear that ow2 is a game build heavily on fomo  in order to complete the battle pass, a player realistically needs to play 35 games on 80 out of the 90 available days, the game demands your time or you lose content, even if you paid for the premium pass  this is the model blizzard are aiming for, they want ow2 to be your main game that you log into every day, and the more you invest, the more sunk cost you have, and the more willing you will be to open your wallet to unlock content that you're constantly reminded will go away if you don't. coupled with this, there's a rather subtle, and nefarious mechanic  lifetime challenges  many of these are trivially easy to clear, which means your first couple of seasons will clear through the battle pass more quickly, making it appear more reasonable, but as those onetime completion challenges dry up, you'll find you have to play more and more to complete the battle pass each season. so... you're intended to play every day, continually, and open your wallet, or you miss content forever. it's an aggressive and abusive system designed to squeeze long time fans for every cent until they burn out and quit.  gameplay wise, the game's feel is very different. hit registration and hit boxes are all over the place, and even very experienced players are complaining that aiming with hitscan feels bad now, it's difficult to pin down, but shots that look like they should hit miss, and shots that look like they should miss hit  with a significant increase in damage to nontanks, skirmishes often feel like a crapshoot. in addition to this, the game is far worse in terms of optimization than before, choppy stuttering animations and lag do not make for a good experience, the changes to lighting and rendering shaders give scenery and characters alike a very uniform plastic texture, resulting in enemies and allies blending into the scenery and being harder to spot in a pinch... long story short, it feels bad to play. the balance of teamfights is also shot, with tanks being nearly impossible to kill especially if they're being healed and everyone else dying almost instantly, play feels especially lacklustre as a healer, because it's almost impossible for a dps or support to be injured but alive, restricting the pair of healers to either pocketing the tank and hoping they know what they're doing, or running their supports as discount dps characters. not to mention the constant bugs, server issues, and generally lazy feel to much of the new design, the replacement of the generally good assault mode with the abysmal push mode, or weird ui and sound. some of the good in ow1 remains, but every change to ow1 in ow2 feels like a downgrade."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"it's overwatch 1, but instead of shooting at shields and being unable to dps them down, you're shooting at the tank with mercy around the corner and unable to dps it down. the pve is mia, due in...2023...maybe? in small chunks? i don't even know anymore. oh, i can also boot the game up on ps5 and share the same progress as on pc, which is nice. also it's free, but you can't really earn any cosmetics outside of the battle pass. boo."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"blizzard so greed. they can't do great games. ow2 is bad optimized. queues, battle pass, greed donate. ow1 was better, but the is no ow1 anymore. ow1 which i bought and can't play now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,waited 3 years for the pve and there's 0 to show for it. 2 maps and 3 heroes for all that time.. just to monetize the hell out of the whole game to the point where it's not enjoyable.. not worth your time. the battle pass isn't good even if i did want to spend money on it
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"downgrade from overwatch 1, sms protect is broken, balance is crap, battle pass makes me like lootboxes. overwatch 2 is simply a game patch masquerading as a sequel, a game patch that took 3 years in development, but with barely any content."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"overwatch 2 is just an attempt to sell the same game twice, this time with a battle pass. they removed maps, make the team comps harsher than they previously were by allowing only 1 tank teams down from 6 to 5 tanks now feel like sturdy dps. they removed all cc from the game, except for the cc they kept in, making some heroes basically useless. the game looks more like fortnite now and is a huge disappointment that they delayed the one feature everyone was excited for, pve. i was able to load into matches after trying for hours and after 3 matches and some time in the practice range, i uninstalled the game. do better blizzard. stop building games for esports competitions and micro transactions."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,overwatch 2 is a good game in terms of quality and assets the developers made. it has had a messy queing system at the start but thats mostly resolved and the monitisation model is decent compared to other free to play games. many people struggle to adapt to a game being free to play. gameplay is super and fun.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,huge fan of the original and was excited to finally play the sequel. this is a massive disappointment from blizzard. my first few hours are spent playing the same maps as i did in the original. a lot of the heroes are blocked until i pay for them and the servers are a mess. not sure what happened during development but this game needs serious work if its to live up to the originals success.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,this is honestly so bad. you cant even get new skins anymore cause of the new system of overwatch credits. you get like 50 credits per week. takes approximately a year to get a new legendary skin. gameplay gets really stale its literally the same game.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"a disgusting game changer operation that was quite popular. the feeling that the blizzard did not want to improve the game, but simply decided to take a little more money from a dead product. the rebalance in 5x5 game was done in principle with dignity, soundly, but not smoothly. some heroes are completely unnecessary. and about the insane prices for skins and the gigantic amount of time to get them for free 32 weeks for 1 skin, you already heard about this."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"this is the  game ive ever played not only its full of cheaters, its  disgusting tanks and healers do 7k dmg in a game and 15 healingmitigation while dmg dealers do 2.7k dmg 0 heal 0 mitigation its not even early acces, this is just build v0.00000001 its so  bad, lets not even talk about the ping thing where everyone teleportsdesync like they are all tracer but the amount of unballancing   for example on moira?  deals more dmg than my hitting only headshots with hanzo, she doesnt need skills or aim, you literally hold click and everything dies while you heal everyone, whats the point of damage dealers, i went a game with 2 tanks 3 healers and we did like 8 times more dmg than enemy team, i had no words, its disgusting they need to remove dmg from every healer, maximum a pistol with 1 dmghit for fun in case they need to kill themselves with it,  game dont play it, queue is anyway 2448 minutes at night"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"overwatch.         ?!    2016 ,  wow"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"ive played over watch since 2016 launch also played the beta. how this could be considered a sequel i dont understand. theres a couple new maps and changing previous maps from night to day?? couldnt play 1st day que had thousands ahead of me. when i did get in, my cosmetics didnt migrate over. its a shame it took 6 yrs for a update and this is what we get? i see why jeff kaplan left. blizzard should do better for players that spent hundreds of hours playing their game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,played ow1 all the time. then they stop making any content for it to gear up for the second instalment. what do we get? 3 heroes and a few maps. three years of nothing for this?!? are you insane? what a complete joke of a sequal this is. its just a facade for them to implement the moste greedy trashfire monetization system i have ever seen. just pure actiblizz at its finest. completely out of touch and greedy. gg ow. was fun.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,i don't like the game balance. it is greatly changed whenever the new character is added. the game turned into a clowning with many stupid looks of characters
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,overwatch 1 but take out all the fun stuff and replace it with every money hungry practice you could possibly have in a mobile game
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"do not invest any money or time into this game, read the reviews and save yourself the pain. this is my first time using this fresh account or ever really using this site. overwatch 2 is a massive disappointment pushed out by a scummy company that exists to push a f2p battle pass model on it's playerbase. the balance team has lost the plot, the lore team never had a plot, and everything from ingame model and ui designs to gameplay has been dumbed down to try and approach a broader audience while simultaneously spitting, pissing and  on the unique flow and character overwatch 1 had. i did not buy overwatch to play call of duty with funny buttons. i played overwatch to play overwatch. now i can't even do that, because the developers have actively decided to  delete the first game out of everybody's library to replace it with the second one that has all these bad changes. even if you liked the first game more, you literally can never play it again. which is  insane, by the way. you spend money to play the first game, it gets deleted and replaced with a free game, and your 'compensation' is such a joke i'm not even going to mention it, because it isn't a real compensation. blizzard actively seems to want this game to only survive off of people that are too  stupid to play other games. i have never seen a game company put 'alienate a majority of our playerbase' on their list describing a path to success. the entire community, at large, has criticized their changes to the game almost every step of the way, and instead of addressing any of it, they have decided to keep making things worse. when your entire playerbase, or at least 90 of it, is screaming and begging you to stop mutilating the corpse of a once beloved game, and you decide to start cooking and eating the remains instead of stomping whatever jello is left into the dirt, you are not creating videogames correctly. that was not the correct response. doubling down on every single thing people don't like about overwatch 2 is why i hope blizzard burns to the ground. there isn't even normal marketing. there is only scum. the company is only scum. i've always known blizzard was full of hacks, but the occasional diamond in the rough always gets 'polished' into a lump of generic, dirty stone when in the hands of blizzard entertainment. you should've put all the funding from overwatch 2 into an arcanestyle overwatch cinematic production and left the first game alone. now that my general thoughts are out of the way, here are a quickfire list of things i dislike battle passes. they're awful. i dislike every and any kind of stupid pseudogambling mechanic, and i do the same to anything that locks ingame content through unnecessary grind. and it's not just cosmetic content either, since now heroes the game's main draw your only way of accessing different weapons and abilities are also locked in battle pass levels, which will be the only way to access new heroes going forwards. old characters are also locked for new players, so it's not just the new heroes your going to have to grind and do silly 'challenges' for, while overwatch 1 had every hero available for the entire playerbase on release, which was infinitely more consumer friendly. the way they've changed certain characters doomfist for example have entirely ruined what made them interesting in the first place. instead of trying to balance a character's kit, they've decided on replacing it entirely. there are very, very few times where this is the right move to make, and this was not one of those times. on the topic of battle passes, genji a character in the game is incredibly strong right now. it is obvious that genji is too powerful. his presence alone in a game, especially the 'free for all' mode, can ruin it. he is strong right now because he has a mythic skin on the battle pass, the 'big money item' that draws players into grinding for it. of course he's broken on release, the same day that the battle pass is introduced to everybody. switching from a 6v6 to a 5v5 format is a big step, and it hasn't been done well. overwatch 1 had 32 playable characters who were all created, designed, and balanced for a 6v6 format. less than half of those characters get real adjustments for the new 5v5 gameplay. the game feels off because it is off. the story mode the game was advertised besides is not actually part of overwatch 2 and will be a separate purchase releasing next year. it is not a sequel. there are so little real changes to the game that it feels like one big bad update, not a fresh title. additionally, the new content is just boring. mostly lacking character, very generic. the newer hero additions to the roster are lacking substance and polish, as are their cosmetics the junker queen's skins all look the same regardless of rarity don't play this game. it will make you feel bad, and blizzard doesn't deserve your playtime, much less money."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"for all the time they had to get this right, and from such a solid start as overwatch, this is awful. the ui is buggy. unforgiveable from such a huge title. removing a tank, intrioducing a damage tank, and changing orisa beyond recognition has transitioned this game from a balance of team supports, to who can keep their tank alive the longest. it's ridiculous. just scrap tanks and heals, and go all damage, this appears to be the desired outcome ultimately. the endorsement system is dramatically reduced  why can't we endorse an enemy player? and still, despite the horrendous privacy violation requiring a mobile telephone is this a crude snipe back at the criticism of the diablo mobile announcement? there are trolls looking to spoil the game. and with only 5v5, that's all it takes. the balance is far more precarious, and blizzard have shown themselves incapable of figuring it out. what a sad legacy to the promise that was overwatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"its almost the same game but they still managed to make it worse by removing loot boxes in favour of a massively expensive item shop and battle pass, making the game 5v5 and adding barely any content after years. the only reason im giving it a 1 and not a 0 is because its f2p and i can play with my imaginary friends"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"it took 3 years to make 5 vs 5 fights, remove free lootboxes and add a battle pass. save your nerves and money. this patch is just a waste of time."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"they call it a new game, overwatch 2, but what is new? 1. donate too much money. 2. battle pass. 3. daynight map. 4. 3 new heroes. so why is this a new game? dead balance in game, why should i buy skins from overwatch to overwatch 2 with real money, it is now impossible to see the levels of players in a match."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"let me start out by saying, i didn't want this game. i didn't buy it. i bought overwatch 1, not overwatch 2. you took away the game i bought and gave me something i didn't want. that's unethical at its finest. it's like taking away my steak that i ordered at a restaurant and given me a pork chop and telling me it's the same thing just because it's meat. now, on to the reasons i don't like it. this game was designed to be a 6v6 not a 5v5. the developers had issues balancing the first version, much less this drastic change it was never intended to be to begin with. i played both beta's they took out all cc, but left in all the dive that the cc was meant to counter. what the hell did they think was going to happen? this just created a huge power gap where every dive character is now the strongest thing in the game with nothing to stop it. effectively this just turned it into a dps game. the tanks don't matter, the healers don't matter. it's just who can put out the most accurate dps damage and kill the other team faster, essentially bringing it down to a 2v2. this is just call of duty overwatch. i see why jeff kaplan left. this company bullied their employees to the point of suicide due to sexual harassment... 202203291089577389judgeactivisionblizzardsettlementsexualharassment now they're introducing things we didn't want or ask for and hiding everything behind a paywall that we did enjoy about the game. much like their history of sexual harassment now they're trying to clap the cheeks of the player base through their wallet and nonconsensually taking away what we paid for to give us what we didn't buy to begin with. i'll be playing paladins. at least they get regular updates and new champions and was designed to be a 5v5 from the start and the que times are like 2 minutes tops for any que and i can play any position i want without roll lock just like classic."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,era melhor nem ter lanado. a blizzard se esforou em fazer um servio porco. filas exorbitantes. problemas de servidor que impedem a grande maioria dos players de logar. contedo como skins e personagens sumindo da conta. desconexes toda vez que conquistas so adquiridas. o jogo  injogvel. nunca vi um lanamento to ruim e problemtico em toda histria do mundo dos games. esse  o conceito de jogo como um servio? s se o servio for produo de suco de lixo.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,not as bad as people say it is. it's basically the same formula as overwatch 1 but for free.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,worse game release baser on reviews ever? dont even dare to play it although i liked overwatch i.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"some pluses there is a new dynamic in the game with 5 players instead of 6 it's quicker and requires different strategies. graphics are different, they look clean. new heroes are fun to play and there are new maps that are genuinely really fun. the negatives hud is difficult. for example, it's very hard to see if you eliminated a player because it's only written in small letters. the main issue is that overwatch moved away from being an uncomplicated game and now requires people to spend stupidly amounts of time playing this game andor paying a lot of money to unlock features. it's really expensive and in no context to the previous game, overwatch 1. i'm not sure if i will stick with this game, as it's designed as a time and money sink. that's sad given that i really enjoyed overwatch 1."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"skins can now only be bought  or earned through the god forsaken battle pass. if they wanted to move to a battle pass, they should've done it before people got burned out on the monetization scheme. no longer will i allow myself to be guilted into playing a game out of fear of missing out fomo. at this moment, the game is not worth supporting because of the predatory monetization practices."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"its my first time in overwatch and i don't care if its the same game, the game is so much fun!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"first of all let me say one thing, fck blizzard. now when that's out of the way lets talk about this cashgrab piece of  garbage mess that is overwatch 2. there is no new content, they straight up lied about addition of exclusive pve mode. servers are  skins are overpriced and game has every microtransantion that's legal today, new heroes are op, healing is extremely overtuned and tanks and healers can now apparently oneshot you. don't play this, lets show them that they can't treat us like we are some mongrels. fck'em"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,don't understand why me who bought ow1 now can't play it and should pay for new heroes in this ow2. why its free now? where is ow1? give me back my money you scummers!!!

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"unlike the first game, this game has nothing added to it. the first game had unique gameplay with unique characters. overwatch 2 is and feels like a cash grab with minimal effort put into it. an unnecessary release filled with bugs and balancing issues. the graphics are also significantly worse with a more too cartoony style. the only positive point is instead of disconnecting you for no reason with no options resulting in you losing your time, overwatch 2 lets you rejoin, though with mixed results."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"ow1 was a really good game that felt fun and balanced. ow2 is somehow an update that removes these two features. add on countless bugs, stupid gameplay choices, and terrible matchmaking this game feels like a freaking prealpha build, not a final product. also scummy monetization drains what little fun this game does have."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"anyone can be a hero, if pays enough. it is not overwatch 2 it's more like overwatch 1.2. 1 point for sound and visual update but that's it. the whole sequel thing looks like a legal excuse for tons of microtransaction, because at one point jeff kaplan told us that new heroes and maps in overwatch will be free. microtransactions.... they are just disgusting, for everything you have to pay with real money. of course they give us ability to earn some coins in game, but it is more like a mockery because you can buy 12 things per season. game have one of the most unfair battle passes i've ever seen  it doesn't contain any coins in it, so you have to buy it every season again and again. game have one currency there is also old coins, but you unable to earn them, so even if you grind that laughable amount of coins in game you need to decide  spend them on new skin or grind for another whole season so you can finally buy a battle pass. i bet in the future we will see a lot of fomo stuff in the ingame shop. yes, the game still enjoyable, but after a good match you remember that you are no longer a hero or even a player, but just bobby's cash cow now, and this feeling spoils all the fun and joy. another heartbreak from blizzard, another ruined and corrupted game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"the changes are not enough to be a dlc, but blizzard calls it a new game, what  everything in gameplay is actually unchanged. blizzard introduced the battle pass to the game, so you can better spend your money and time to unlock some stupid skins. and at this moment, the game balance is a real issue. tank heroes are too op. ow2 is definitely the joke of the year!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"is blizzard drunk or on drugs? what are they thinking? same balancing problems, same greed, heck, same game as overwatch 1 essentially. this is overwatch 1.2."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,it's pay to win trash. just sell it up front like the original instead of locking characters behind a paywall. removing the original game shows just how scummy they are. the free way of unlocking characters is in no way reasonable. it's because of games like this that i no longer bother with anything f2p. the uninstall is the only good thing about it.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"my god i hate this game. everyones talking about the queue but besides that, nothing is good. ive been playing overwatch since 2016 and its my favorite game, but now its just slightly changed in all the wrong damn ways. there hasnt been a big enough update to call it a new game, but its just so  now. 1 battle pass. eff battle pass. this is the worst part of the update. it seems like they made this so that they could get more money off of the game because it looks like theyre going for more of a fortnite set up since fortnite is still super popular while only big fans of overwatch regularly play it. and ngl i think thats the way it should be. thats how most shooter games turn out and thats fine !!! because i want to freaking play real overwatch !!! to get legendary skins pretty much the only way youre able to buy them from the shop is actually paying for the skins. otherwise youd have to play the weekly challenges for just a little under a damn year. thats besides the fact that you have to pay extra to be able to get specific items from the battle pass. it . i didnt pay for the real overwatch 6 years ago just to end up with a trashy free overwatch 2 reboot. 2 you have to do all these challenges to unlock players that we were previously able to play. wtf!?! that makes literally no sense. i dont wanna play 70 matches just to unlock mei. nah. this is another part of the game that just takes away from the real gameplay of overwatch. 3 the look of it. overeatch 2 looks so much worse than overwaatch like come on whats wrong with blizzard yall dont know what ur  and all the new sayings that the characters say i do not stand with they are so much worse than the old ones. this isnt going to all the voice actors or graphic designers its going to blizzard. i am never playing overwatch 2 screw u"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"i've been playing overwatch since the release day of the first game, and have spent many hours enjoying it since then. i would have gladly spent another 60 retail for this second edition to have it continue the formula with its random cosmetic loot boxes. this move to a battle pass system is absolutely atrocious. and the prices of cosmetic items in the shop...... my lord, what have they done?! i'll probably spend many more hours playing this game, but i refuse to spend a dime on any of its ridiculously overpriced extras."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"it isn't worth to name it overwatch 2. it's like a big update, not a new game or something similar. but for everyone who liked before, could be still like it. it's just overwatch 1 with an update."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"the fact that you need to play up to 100 games to unlock the entire roster is ridiculous in and of itself, especially when this game started as a full unlocked 24hero list right off the bat for everyone. the battle pass system is just every other freemium garbage system designed to  every loose penny out of you. this game would rather beg that you keep playing to unlock characters you might think are cool instead of trusting that their game is good enough to justify putting that much time into it. 5v5 i can take it or leave it. it feels like blizzard didn't know what to do with tanks so they just axed a team slot to save queue times. if you've been playing overwatch for a long time and already have everything unlocked you may or may not like this title. everyone else should just steer clear. this game asks way too much of new players."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"there's a lot wrong with this game that is supposed to be an upgrade from the former version. my personal experience with it is that, despite being an upgraded version really not much has changed in terms of graphics or style and yet, on my pc i get massive frame drops that never occurred in the first game. i dont have the best pc but even in ow1 i was able to play on mediumlow to mediumhigh settings with little to no issue. why is the game suddenly so heavy on my pc with very little to no change graphicswise? if anything it seems even more simple than before then of course the wait times and the fact that some people arent able to play at all just due to their phone plan. it's a complete mess that never should have happened."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-08,"game plays fine and is just overwatch 1 with some tweaks. definitely is free to play. not free to do anything else, though. leaves veterans in the dust with no way to continue progression, somehow removing the lootboxes was a mistake  even if they just kept that around for tiny coin drops of 5  30 coins it'd be a massive improvement to compliment the battle pass system. other than that, a shameless grab to rival immortal. play it for free, but don't bother spending your money on it, especially if you're a vet who already has skins they enjoy. spend your money better by paying for coins to buy your specific skin, not for the chance to maybe earn them if you have the time to put in to the grind. but don't even do that  don't give them a cent."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,as an old overwatch fan im completely devastated and disappointed. i rly hop it flops and they bring back real overwatch.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"after playing ow2 for a while, the insidious thought that slowly creeps on you is to pay up before you get your keester blasted by wealthy sweats with the current monetization model! blizzard knows how to collect desperate gamer cash, pure geniuses. this is not to mention the ridiculous server queues add a quicker wait time battle pass ftw and illogical timing of server maintenance, this is simply an absurd launch. blizzard technically rereleased a messier ow1 and hard wiped player progress. one of the greatest marketing gimmicks of all time!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,5 years for a reskin and slightly tweaked abilities. this game is garbage. balance is bad. single tank . orisa is broken. can't queue. obvious cash grab with a  battle pass system. from such heights blizz fell to this broken shell of a schill game producer
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,they deleted a perfectly functioning enjoyable fps and replaced it with a festering turd of a f2p mess. to gain a comparison for anyone wondering. imagine if blizzard had deleted diablo 3 to make diablo immortal but the diablo immortal servers were constantly
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"it's free. it's a mod of overwatch 1. in a lot of ways, the game feels great. they changed it in the ways they needed to, to make the characters stronger, and the fighting more intense."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"i love waiting in 20 min3 hr queues to play a broken garbage game. not only could you lose your items, disconnect mid game, or even need a phone number to play but you can also get your heros locked randomly for no reason. i would rather deal with lootboxes and tryhards on ow1 then be forced to play another second of this game."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"forget about the bad launch and bugs aside , the game got rehashed into the same just to milk it with battle pass and micro transactions... you thought lootboxes were bad ... wait till you see how bad it turned to point that you cannot longer grind most of the skins. no wonder jeff left, it's sad because blizzard and activision still hold some of the best talent of artists and developers slaving for that nice salary. the game screams give me your money and lost any of its charm. i have already super bad feeling about diablo 4 turning into the same as this and immortal . blizzard is been doing bad for years and people have been saying rip since blizzard north but whatever was left is gone as well. after 23 years of being loyal . i'm done ."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,game feels floaty. lots of bugs. honestly worse than the original overwatch. clunky ui and too much clutter on the screen. i got headache after playing it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"look, the gameplay isn't too bad. and the servers do not , because it is still early days and they have just had ddos attacks for days, so the server issues and lack of play are not their fault. the same cannot be said for the greedy, disingenuous and lackluster 'battlepass', which is a worse than clash of clans and is not only lackluster but pointless, as it bestows flaky, rushed cosmetics and a new hero who most of the playerbase can get for free ow1 players, and new players can obtain by grinding out the game which they would do anyway if they wanted to get any of the skins, which brings me onto my next point that the monetization is practically raid shadow legends. ever since uncle jeff left, the game and the user experience has gone downhill, and now we have exorbitant prices and impeccably low challenge rewards. 8 months for one skin is not at all fair. furthermore they have replaced the original, specific endorsement system, which is not bad but unnecessary, and removed levels to 'combat toxicity', which is completely absurd as now we do not only have no skins to show our progress and levels, but now do not have any levels to show it either. i love overwatch and the gameplay is sweet, minus a few balancing and some ui fixes, but if they want their game to be successful like it can and rightfully should be, they need to seriously buckle down and look at the success fortnite's battlepass granted epic games, or the stigma and hatred pointed towards their adopted mobilegame system."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,activisions predatory practices and putting shareholder over consumers has once again created a money grabbing crap fest. i would recommend folks not play this game. the game play is fun but if you are just starting its not worth the time and effort or money.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,not only players who bought the game recieved nearly nothing cosmetic but the game has unstable and uncapable servers with queues up to 40000 players just to enter the game. really hope blizzard bumps down the price for the battle pass and give old players more cosmetics or coins like in pubg when it became free.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,aggressive monetization. no benefit to who buy the game ow1. new champions without storyline. new ranked point system foggy and unclear. blizzard ignore the fanbase thinking only to the best way to do money.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"there is not really much that needs to be said. they just changed a bunch of things that didn't need to be changed and called it a new game so they had an excuse to remonetize overwatch. you now need to grind the battle pass to unlock new heroes, and skins are locked behind 20 bundles. i'm not really surprised because eventually activision ruins everything they own the rights to, but it's still extremely disappointing to see the original overwatch get wiped from existence for this poor excuse of a sequel."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,1 point for the new voice lines and the mechanics. but overall this game is a bad version of ow1. and on top it's pay2win. you need to play almost 50hrs 10days straight with 5hrs per day to get the new hero or you can pay for it hello little brother of battlefront. that's not what blizzard is known for but it's exactly what you expect from activision.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"it is absolutely that old overwatch 1 with only little bit change of sounds, maps and  3 new heroes. but you know what is interesting? of course it's blizzard greediness. pay for new heroe, pay for all that 34 years old skins which you could get literally free on overwatch 1. pay, pay, pay!!! but no matter how much you pay  it's anyway now looks like 80 of time you just wait for your turn to play and 20 of time you can enjoy gameplay. thank you, blizzard! it's 100 new brand game. such a shame but it's not first time for you mates, huh?"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"spending 60 on a game that isn't fun is sad. but overwatch 1 brought a lot of positive emotions. therefore, after the announcement of the 2nd part, i waited for the first game to be tweaked and enhanced. and this is the first frustration  the game that i bought no longer exists. imagine that you bought a song by a popular native artist, which in a couple of years replaced by a song of no named russian artist, and without warning. don't expect quality from overwatch 2. it feels like rewatching the tv show from childhood when you're already grown up  everything is very familiar, but equally foreign. new graphic design  a solid 1 out of 5. everything has changed. if you have not played for a long time, you will be greeted by a completely new ui. simply bad. all menus have changed  finding something where you found it for 8 years is unrealistic. 5v5 aren't 6v6. you are again in new circumstances. the characters have changed  it's not bad, from one point of view. on the other hand, no one warned you about this. before and after entering the game, you were asked many times to buy something. but they didnt tell how your favorite characters changed. overall score 1.5 out of 10. 0.75 for the title and another 0.75 for being the only game i play with my 11yearold son. he really liked the overwatch 1."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"it's a patch, not a new game. changing to 5 man means your 1 tank is so important that if you have even a mediocre one then the game is over. it's not a new game, adding the 2 was a marketing move and the battle pass is a joke, it gets you very little of use. servers are awful blizzard should know how to fix this by now but i guess they can't be bothered, it happens at the launch of every blizzard game. the new heroes are completely stacked to the point of being silly, from more immortalityimmunity mechanics and shots that shoot through everyone like it's a cardboard box on cod, to healers that one shot you across the map. positives... it looks pretty! negatives... too many to list all of them i was truly hoping that this was going to bring me back but honestly, after a couple of days i'm already done with it. if i were to write an open letter to blizzard about this game, it would simply say i'm disappointed, you dressed up a content patch for any other game as a new game entirely. for a developer of this size they are being shown up by every small studio out there currently and for a studio the size of blizzard to take over 3 years to make 3 characters, a battle pass and a couple of maps... it's utterly shameful. overwatch players got used to certain team sizes and built groups and friendships based on that and now they're being told to leave people out and just play 5v5... sod that!"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"if earlier it was my favorite game in which i spent a lot of time with friends, now it just looks like some kind of misunderstanding, with an absolutely inadequate monetization system, when in order to receive the final reward you need to spend more time in the game than on work, or pay more than a new aaa release is worth. accumulating ingame currency just by playing, in order to later buy the skin you like, will no longer work. just pay, or save crumbs of coins by completing tasks every day during the week, so that at the end of the year you can buy yourself one or two skins, if you're lucky. the dynamics of the game have changed a lot, which did not benefit her. now the game is completely made with a focus on esports. for regular players who want to have a nice evening with friends, or whose rank in the competitive game is gold or lower, this game is no longer suitable. on the plus side, i can say that they managed to preserve the very atmosphere of the old overwatch. the visual component, music, scenery of the map  everything is still done quite well. however, this is not the same old overwatch that i liked."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"blizzard r.i.p., overwatch r.i.p. i preordered the overwatch. it was a good game, but over time it got worse and worse. each new patch brought an imbalance in characters. the game's netcode is poorly implemented. the game's netcode is poorly implemented. matchmaking was not balanced, you were thrown into 10 losing matches in a row, and only one winning one. i kept playing this game and suffering for hero skins. almost all skins could be obtained for free. after overwatch 2 released, there is no point in playing anymore. the game is now donat, but it has not become better. the game got worse technically. the developers to spoil what worked for years. now the game offers to buy a battle pass and spend a lot of time on upgrading it. to complete daily and weekly tasks, you need to live in the game. i don't need this game for free. now i can remove this game without regret."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"toxicity is alive and well. playing new characters available for less than 4 hours to the general public got people all hot and bothered when the player wasn't a master instantly. couple with all the normal overwatch whining from 'you're playing your tank wrong' to 'heal me despite the fact that i'm not anywhere near the group' to 'what's a point? i do what i want'. but now that it's a 6 year old game, people expect everyone to be at the top of their game still. cutting a tank was okay by me. it makes the push a little faster. the battlepass isn't incentive to level, and that's what overwatch 1 really lacked incentive. they took out a lot of the cool flash of the game. eliminations are just tiny red bars now. there's less personality on the battlefield. and since this is 'early access', there's no coop mode. let's not forget about the fact they couldn't launch. the only worse launch i can think of was atlas. this was pretty tragic. i'd say that all around, overwatch 2 is a big fail. they will likely right the ship enough to squeeze people for battlepass cash. i'm sure plenty of people will play it. but it's games like this and the fact people are going to stick around that allows developers to put out subpar games and terrible launches. because after a few days of whining, people just line up, pay for it, and play. blizzard doesn't deserve a pass for this. but they'll get it."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"the game isn't worth the wait, this isnt an improvement to the game, it's at best the same quality with some changes and at worst a complete downgrade that destroys the ip's good name. they decided to go free to play as an excuse to try and milk as much money as possible from the playerbase, damaging both competitive integrity as well as the game experience in the process. everything in the shop is overpriced whether or not you can grind for them, and locking heroes behind a battlepass, forcing you to either pay up or grind for weeks just to keep up in a competitive is not acceptable, in a hero based game it is ridiculous and has a net negative on the game, providing no silver lining besides that the execs get even more money they made the decision to remove one tank player from each team as well as most cc and some barriers in the game. however they have utterly fail to change and redesign the roster in order to fit with this new environment, causing a meta that heavily favored the flankers and precision based players while severely weakening the already unpopular but very necessary support and tank players. the game also failed to live up to even the bare minimum expectations, players have been waiting 3yrs for this and yet i can name all of the new things ow2 has in a single breath. this game gets 0 as it is an overall downgrade in almost every aspect from ow1, the game it replaced and all of these new greed based changes are compounded by the fact that players have been patient waiting several years for this suffering through extremely long content drought that was al in vain."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"update my original thoughts still stand but i have enjoyed the new change to 5v5. however i do mainly play open queue which leads to much more interesting team compositions. there's so much that still needs to be ironed out in this game. hero balancing needs a ton of work but it will get there. what i really miss the most is award voting at the end of games, medals, leveling up and the showing of other people's levels during a game. the scoreboard is okay but the old one felt superior for personal stats. it does help if you think a teammate would be better off being in a different role as you can easily see how everyone is doing and make a suggestion. original i feel like they've ruined what used to be an awesome game. i played overwatch for nearly 1000 hours. definitely one of the best games i've ever played with the most intense moments, particularly in competitive. overwatch 2 felt like apex at times. it's like they had to add lots of sounds, turn the saturation up to 100 to add appeal to the game. it doesn't feel right. the lack of prestige levels makes it feel like your playing without progression. not entirely sure what benefit there was to removing them. i know it's free to play now but i hate how expensive everything is. i don't consider 1900 credits a reasonable price for what is essentially just a digital cosmetic. it's a real shock going from how overwatch worked to this. collecting all of the items was a real pull for me playing overwatch and now i feel as though i'm just being excluded because i'm unwilling to throw hundreds of pounds at blizzard. i just don't believe in this type of game monetisation system. i mean i get a free game but i'd much rather pay for a game and not be excluded from things. the in game stat screen is a definite downgrade. yes it's nice seeing other people's stats but i care more about my own. it's not quick or easy to read. the showing of other stats only creates internal team competition rather than focusing on the objective of the game mode. it will inevitably lead to a lot of calling out of those who think certain teammates aren't pulling their weight. i miss the awarding of medals based on each stat and the voting system at the end to call out good gameplay. the simplification of the endorsement system is also a downgrade, it could have been expanded to actually help describe what each player is good at contributing to a team. i didn't feel as though i was really connected with what was going on gameplay wise whilst playing. it felt odd as i never felt this way in ow1. i just wasn't getting hyped when we were pushing on objective or about to win. at times it felt like the whole gameplay was just a mess. these are probably the most obvious things i've noticed so far. now for what i liked. the new characters are good, have inventive abilities and are quite fun to play. the addition of more hot button commands to share info with your team going in, defending, watching here etc are really good. this is something that was really lacking in ow1. i'll update this as things progress."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"blizzard is ruining everything it touches. i've played this game since the original beta. this isn't a sequel, and this isn't overwatch. this is the diablo immortal of ow, except the juries still out on whether people will fall for it and give the  they want. this is awful, and another reminder that we still need legislation that mandates video game companies keep old games running or allow us to. blizzard could have released a server  client for ow1, let us host our own servers for it if they wanted to wipe their hands of it. such was the norm whenever a company killed a game just a short decade ago. instead, they're allowed to literally commit theft in all but the legal sense now. it's only 20 yes, it was 20 6 years ago, and i want my game. funnily enough, many other publishers get the message, and even electronic arts ea, yeah them, they keep their old games running. simcity 2000 is playable today on the modern ea client. it's a sad day when ea overtakes blizzard, but here we are, it's happened both greed wise and 'give a hoot' wise. 20 for 11000th of what we could get for free cosmetics wise just days ago. 100x or harder or more to earn in game cosmetics. all in the name of blizzards greed. it's a sad day when lootboxes are the preferred and more reasonable option to what we have now. the game feels worse than ow1 at launch and ow1 before they took it down this week. it's got 110th the balancing, 110th the qol features, 110th the good artwork, and somehow 10x the bugs and toxicity. 68 games tonight have had toxic all chat. oh yeah, and supports are in jail now everywhere outside of gm to owl range. they also made the engine worse, plain and simple. you can't play the old ow1 and tell me it feels better, even given the hero changes and identical stats. i can't say exactly what they did, but it feels more valoranty. but not entirely valornt, just a weird tinge of valorant engine on the old ow1 engine. oh yeah, and this indie dev couldnt keep servers up for 2 days during launch. ea did better with fifa. i hope blizzard makes a lot of money from the 9 year olds stealing their parents credit card to buy skins on ow. i won't be spending a cent on the game. oh yeah, and smurfing is still a thing, btw.. as if the people who could afford to buy multiple game accounts to smurf can't afford phone plans or dont have connections to people who would offer a phone .. a class of 9th graders could've found half the errors in ow2 and i cannot believe it's been shipped like this ow2 is beat by everything else. it's lost its unique niche, and now it's a poor attempt at being something it never was or could be. i guess we'll see if they eventually manage to kill the very last of the visible spirit and slowly build their own valorant out of ow. sad they couldn't just make another ip and decided to kill this one instead for their battlepass greed fix. in case your wondering, blizzard made billions on ow lootboxes each year in profit. problem is, they want valorant's tens of billions, and couldnt care less about us. blizzard has it's sights set on the whales, and they've designed ow2 to try and bring them in and make existing players lives hard enough that they become the whales for them. wonder if it'll convert enough people into monterary slaves for em. this review is long. i'm just sad they killed my game. thousands of hours, t500 for multiple seasons and gm others, and it's just gone. change for the sake of change. theft for the sake of greed. blizzard's abandoned this game, so personally i think someone just reverse engineer ow1 source code and publish a serverclient. in the us, there's an abandoned video game exception to the dmca. if blizzard tries to claim they didn't abandon it, they have to legally prove that the exact same game exists today per 2018 case law. just waiting to see it published somewhere.. can't be the only one thinking about it"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-07,"gameplay wise, the game is a minor downgrade from overwatch 1. however, i refuse to give this game any score above 1 until the absolute abhorrent monetization practice is changed. 20 for 1 legendary skin is genuinely disgusting, along with the fact the 'premium' battle pass doesn't give you any currency and how emotes, victory poses, highlight intros, and everything customizable, costs at least 300 of the premium currency of which you can only receive 60 of for free per week. this includes voicelines, which is unbelievable. it truly feels like blizzard couldn't care less about fans and views them quite literally as wallets and nothing else, and feels like they are using free to play as an excuse to throw in these horrendous microtransactions. i wish i could play this game but doing so would show them i will continue to play even with this terrible business model, which i refuse to do so."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"this excuse of a title is utter garbage. the lack of awareness that blizzard has is overwhelming. blizzard knew that opening the game to be free to play would need to have better servers and more maintenance, yet, blizzard blames everything that went wrong with the launch on a  title on a ddos attack that hasn't been proven to have happened yet. besides the long queue time which should be fixed soon hopefully, the gameplay itself is a complete step back from the original overwatches gameplay. with many people getting disconnected from competitive games and people bouncing back and forth across the map due to the servers being so damn bad the game itself is complete garbage. the only thing that saves this game from zero is that the launch revives r34 and porn for overwatch characters. other than that i see no point in consuming overwatch content until the game is fixed and the servers are stable."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"overwatch 2 is the biggest disappointment blizzard has ever come out with. and i've been through many if not all of their previous releases since diablo ii. for one, overwatch 2 marked the end of overwatch 1 which absolutely no one asked for. switching the game from 6v6 to 5v5 has to be one of the worst ideas that, once again, no one asked for. it has made the game feel slower, emptier, and clunkier. tanks are no longer tanks, but bruisers. they're just dps with slightly more health. then there's the battle pass. how incredibly money hungry is this rapidly declining, sorry excuse for a company? if you don't buy the bp, you pretty much get nothing to enjoy. levels are gone, end cards are gone, everything that made ow fun has been removed and replaced with bp. why play if you can't pay? there's no reason. after playing this game since day 1 closed beta, i've finally uninstalled. enjoy your money from the ones actually willing to pay for this trash. thanks for ruining one of my favorite games of all time."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"well, it's very sad to see what a game i've played since i was a kid has turned into. for me it was something very close to my heart, different from other games like counter strike global offensive, battlefield etc. at one time, i bought the legendary version of the game not even for skins, but in order to support the developers, and the fact that the game was paid eliminated a lot of toxic people. of course, no existing game has ever done without them, but in overwatch the community was atmospheric and kind in its own way. i'll start with the cons. 1. the game is now free  like i said, this adds accessibility to a lot of idiots that i wouldn't want to see and listen to in my favorite game. 2. the second point follows from this  because of the free to play, the developers decided to add a battlepass, and i would close my eyes to this if it were free, like the containers in the first ov, but all the interesting things were stuffed into a paid battlepass, which i i can't even buy i'm a ru player. the literal monetization of all cosmetics in ov2 is a direct path to the bottom. even the skins that were released in ov1 became paid, and the coins that remained with ov1 became useless, and they cant even be exchanged for a new currency. of course, this was not the main thing in the game, but it added interest to play, knock out containers and increase the level with which my experience with the skill increased. 3. new icons and interface. i feel like all the good designers have been screwed over and hired kids because they look frankly ugly.  huge squares in the character menu, instead of medium and nice looking rounded rectangles lying at an angle, it doesn't look stylish or pretty.  almost the same story with the interface of the character's health pool, it has become more square and straight in contrast to the slightly rounded squares  also ugly.  same story with character abilities  normal squares instead of rounded rhombuses  the style of the ultimate has become not beautiful, although there are almost no changes, but it still does not look beautiful.  the character selection menu has the same story  squares instead of diamonds  and it pisses me off that it's like that everywhere, it absolutely did not need a redesign.  new 3d models in the lower left corner of the screen look bad. 4. also, the developers decided to remove the level icons that were in ov1  but why? in order for the players not to have a biased attitude towards the allies, the developers answered. for me, this is fierce nonsense, since only those units of toxins in ov1 were biased towards the player, judging by his level and by the way, sometimes it even played the opposite way  people could shame highlevel players by calling them nerds. i dont deny that by the level i could judge who i should heal more and help, but this was a plus, because in this way a team game was formed, which was always emphasized in ov1. also, the levels were an aesthetic pleasure, because it was just nice to see a beautiful frame and characters in it although i did not even have time to take a silver frame. 5. instead of your profile icons, players now see only character art  this is also an omission, because it was an aesthetic component of ov1, and it was possible for the whole team to display the same icon for fun. 6. the statistics of enemies and allies became visible  kills, deaths, damage done, etc. doesn't that cause prejudice, blizzard? after all, the impact of the player does not determine this at all, just like in ov1, even jeff kaplan joked about this topic in the new year's issue. 7. and due to the fact that prominent statistics appeared during the match, which is visible to everyone  the character cards disappeared at the end of the match ... this is a very big omission, because it was nice to put your praise to the ally and in some cases to the enemy, and then hear cool phrases from them it was especially nice when you were the person who was praised. but no, they decided to remove it by adding ugly statistics like in cs go. 8. by the way, the interface itself when you press the tab key during a match is also disgusting, licked from other shooters like cs go  a complete lack of style... let's move on to more serious issues. 9. battlepass cosmetics are survivable, albeit with difficulty  but characters in battlepass? seriously, blizzard? as a player from ov1, they are certainly available to me, but what will happen next? they only open at level 55, and these are the weeks of grinding, and keep in mind that not everyone can afford to play a lot. unfortunately, i cant write more than 5 thousand letters .. thats sa, i have something to say, and even praise ov2 a little, but the metacritic did not think that there are users like me, for whom the game is really important, and what they think about it in to the fullest."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"loved how overwatch looked. when you were on fire it was distinct, when you killed someone it was more known. now its the opposite and just overall not very appealing. the game feels like it should have been an update, not an entirely new game. very little content just a new layout with reworked characters that arent anything amazing. as all other comments said.. the skins, loot boxes, pretty much everything that made overwatch what it was is gone. its just for money for some reason. i much prefer overwatch 1."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"the game is a absolute joke. middle the third day of so called launch and i still can't get past the title screen on either playstation or xbox. them being under attack by a ddos doesn't matter. its a billion dollar company. and the fact that its been happening this long is out right pathetic. especially when those who actually manage to get in the game, lose all cosmetics, lose access to the founders pack they paid for, relock already unlocked heroes, and lose their battlepass. also 40 dollar skins now. what a embarrassing joke. and they deleted the first game so you cant even go back to play the game you paid for. you have to play this new game if you even can, and are seriously expected to pay this much for skins? are you serious? the fact it was even a consideration makes me feel no compassion for this company. especially when the other half of the game they actually advertised, isn't coming till next year. oh have some compassion they are working hard ya to rip you off. those people need to wake up. this a is soulless broken update disguised as sequel, made for the soul purpose of ringing out the fans for cash like a wet sponge. embarrassing."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"i have time to write a review while i'm sitting in line. blizzard has had this problem for 10 years since diablo 3 and they still can't figure out how to need more servers before release because a small indie studio doesn't have the money to rent more server space. it was also impossible to preload the game, which is why the download speed after the release was about 1 mb. and against the background of all this, one can only be glad that they did not change the game, because you understand that modern blizzards cannot cope even with such trivial tasks, which means that they are already unable to make a new highquality game. their modern team can only be offended and spoil the fans' favorite games, and they are no longer able to do something worthwhile."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,overwatch  the franchise that no one wanted and no one asked for. starcraft 2 released in 2010. warcraft 3 released in 2002. where is warcraft 4? where is starcraft 3? blizzard has forgotten the games the franchises that won fans over and made them popular in the first place. how on earth did we get an overwatch 2 before a starcraft 3? what has happened to this company? keep your disney esque shooter. we don't want it and the user score speaks for itself. overwatch is a bad game and a lame franchise.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,",         this is an unfortunate mess for the game. servers are down huge queue times, and lots of microtransactions. what used to be a fun game and series has now dropped everything that made the game fun. one of the biggest parts of overwatch was its loot boxes. although i love the decision to remove loot boxes from the game, there is no longer any way to obtain cosmetics for free. a 3yearold skin now costs about 20. for someone who bought the 100 dollar version of overwatch 1 i no longer am able to unlock the skins previously in the game, no i have to buy them. there are no more levels, and credits are no longer obtainable. for owning overwatch 1 you are given 2 skins that i will probably never use and you are able to use the new hero instantly. i think i should at least get the battle pass for free as well. you can however obtain the premium currency for free, but only 500 which is about 5 worth. this is not enough to buy the battlepass and this only encourages you to buy more credits. these are terrible mechanics to steal people's money. blizzard does not need any more money, they are a 50 billion dollar company, please stop defending them. i have seen many people defend them online saying overwatch needs to make money to survive, they just put out diablo immortal and in the first 3 days they made over 100 million in sales."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"endless queues, limitless greed, bugs, and the inability to play with friends anymore  this is what the current overwatch is. the battlepass system is terrible, you can't farm money for a new battlepass during the current one. why? in cod it is considered normal. all blizzard is willing to give you is 60 credits per week. why so much greed? you will have to save several months to be able to buy one skin. every evening it is impossible to enter the game. the company that produces world of warcraft has no idea that when the game comes out, people want to play it? and the funniest thing. i played overwatch with my friends. one of them and i were able to enter the game and even play, while the rest were in queue. when they were able to get in, we found out that we can't play together as we have different versions of the game!! we spent 4 hours to find out that we have different versions of the same game and we can't play together!! thank you blizzard for destroying the game i loved."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,i think this game is a huge upgrade compared to overwatch 1. only bad thing is that the server got ddossed so noone can play it.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"sorry blizz. you didnt make it. again. unplayable for 24 hours now, thats unaccaptable in 2022."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"i fear that this is the same game with one less tank, a slight modernisation of graphics, and content that should've just come to ow1. the only reason this came out as a sequel is to transform the game into a free to play with ultra greedy transactions that are not micro by any means, 40 dollars for a battle pass every season. the 5v5 with one tank made the game more active and speedy, but it also severely damaged the tactical experience of ow. so many of the maps that used to be special, that required thought, pressure and poking to fight properly in, are now just another big area with outdated graphics. for example the first point of kings row, widely considered the best or top 3 best maps of ow1 by everyone, is now barely any different than any of the other maps. i used to have so many doubts on placement and pressure as a tank, so much about resource management and risk taking as a support. now you just walk in and start blasting at the nearest enemy. the game is plain dumber. the maps are totally unsuited for the 5v5, although the new maps are better, all grand total of 4 of them for the roughly 40 maps of ow1. the balancing problems which killed ow1 since 2018 are not at all solved, they are equalized in the sense that now, everyone can shoot almost immediately and don't have to rely on passing tanks to do so. the new problem is that while you have no double shields or a tank in front of you at every pass, you rely almost entirely on your overpowered solo tank to survive. if your tank throws, you might as well see the defeat screen immediately. they are so powerful and you must rely on him so much that if your tank can't diff or at least survive the other tank, you're done. as a flex but mostly support player, this reliance makes me hesitate between being the tank every game, or just stop trying. also, few things have outright improved. the graphics are modernised, they're not comparatively better. round things are rounder like faces, models are more graphically demanding, but that's it. there are few to no super amazing visual effects. it's not like i mind, ow1 was already a clusterfk of visuals in big fights, but it drives home the point that this sequel has no particular value and wasn't made for technical need. also even for an improvement, it's definitely not a 20162022 jump. ow1 for 2016 looked far better than ow2 for 2022. a gtx 960 could run ow1, and i'm betting a gtx 1060 can run ow2 comfortably, so it's more of a 23 year progress. some things are inexplicably absent or worse. the glorious on fire status that indicated that you were doing great? gone. the amount of damage you did on a kill? gone. why? those were great and helped players a lot! the little notches on your ultimate icon that helped see just how much you had are gone too, now it's a plain circle that fills it. it's not a big downgrade, but again, why change and make it worse? it's like the devs were told to find things to change to justify the new game, when none of that needed fixing and some was just outright great. the removal of the medal system in favour of a shared scoreboard is great though. finally no more pointless arguments about how good or bad you're doing for your team. in short, the game is more or less the same, but slightly worse or better here and there. the details in ui and graphics really do not justify at all a sequel, and in every way could've been done in ow1. the downgrade in certain qol elements is just plain bizarre on fire status will really be missed. the only real changes are the 1 tank system and the financial model. the game is much less tactical and more speed and damage oriented. it feels dumber, simpler, and less profound. the free to play model is as greedy and predatory as ever, perhaps worse than diablo immortal's. this really feels like they took overwatch, plastered some reskins, cut off one tank, completely brainwashed it from a game whose goal was to be fun, to a game that must  as much money as possible. it's a frankensteins game to me, and my longstanding attachment to ow has almost singlehandedly disappeared in a few nights. i wanted to play ow all the time. i can barely feel anything towards ow2. there is an ongoing rumour that ow2 is meant to become a pve game with great ambitions, but that it was delayed. considering the lies of activision blizz on wc3 reforged and on diablo immortal, i do not expect any promises to be held. but if they are, i'll amend this review when it comes out."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"a disasters launch, followed by player realizing that the new monetization system may be one of the worst ever made 2nd only to diablo immortal. if you can't afford a premium phone service, then you can't play the game. that is straight up economic discrimination and hopefully someone with more resources than myself will be able to file a lawsuit. this is a disgraceful release  nobody asked for, fixing problems that didn't exist. shame on everyone who had anything to do with this joke."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"sure, the people voting 0 are technically abusing the system. but truthfully, any game thats this predatory, and this disgusting to its user base deserves it. from the battle pass, to the 5v5. especially the 5v5 the game isnt overwatch anymore. its not about what they added, its the fact that the game fundamentally has lost its identity, and i truthfully believe anyone championing this change never liked overwatch and simply wanted to play a generic shooting game. cause ow2 is a fine game when it comes to the core gameplay. if it wasnt called overwatch that is. but it is, and this is not the game i fell in love with. the problem being the game i fell in love is dead and has been replaced permanently. its depressing that ill never get to play it again."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"r.i.p overwatch. downgraded graphics particularly lighting, downgraded interface, queues to launch game,  monetization 60 credits per week with with a skin price of 2000, are you kidding?, battle pass grind to unlock new heroes for free  not what i bought overwatch for. blizzard is no longer the team that made overwatch. please don't support blizzard, don't make any ingame purchases."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"regardless of the rocky launch that's being kind, the gameplay is excellent. i'm giving them a pass on the launch because of the added ddos attack is out of their control. the sms issue with users not being able to play if they have a prepaid phone is pretty crappy but they're reversing that for existing players. yes, i recognize it's more of the same but the tweaks and additions to gameplay feel fresh. i don't like the battlepass but knowing that i'll only purchase the battle passes with new characters, it's only 3 a year i believe. i do not love that we only get 3 new characters a year but i also appreciate how difficult it would be to integrate and balance a new character into the game. losing a team member has really changed the feel of the game. it's much faster, battles feel more chaotic and fun. also updating the speed of the characters has really changed the feel of the game. i just hope they treat this version of overwatch better, the community needs more content, more frequently to keep players coming back. it's a pretty good start so far."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"feels like a cash grab. the progression is extremely slow and it incites you to spend more money. it's just ow1 f2p with some gameplay changes could've just made it as a patch update instead of waiting 3 years for this. also locking the new heroes behind a paywall is even scummier with how overwatch is supposed to be played. i can't wait for the pve freemium part so i have to spend more money to unlock new stuff. garbage game, a downgrade in comparison to ow1"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"overwatch 2 is a small content patch for overwatch. the 5 on 5 game mode is horrible. no rhythm, everyone is running and shooting, the defensive side always loses. why did you remove the second tank from the team, why did you remove the shields? what do you have to do before the matches there are speeds to keep up with what is happening on the screen? about battlepass here everything is clear  just a quick buck at low cost. i want to play overwatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"list of changes sms verifications for play  i paid money for my ow1 accounts to play, why i should link phone numbers to play my alts? 5v5  less tanks  less game setups. its not cool less control  okay some people get advantages of this, but other like support mains get disadvantages. you keep 122 role lock in most gamemodes. its not cool cuz you have less gamesetups for play. new map extremely bad imo. i can't give a definitive reason why, but they feel really bad. it's like you're playing in the trash. the new monetization strategy is too aggressive. guys, you are blizzard, not some little indie company that releases freetoplay games and tries to  money out of the players with all its might. technical aspects the graphics don't look better. your lighting games look 25 and it's hard to say that they improve anything. if we look at it from an angle that you have made such a graphics improvement in 6 years of ow1, then you have done it very badly. the game interface doesn't look better either. competitive rank badges are just ridiculous and shameful. and we can talk much about the stability of game servers in the first days of launch. blizzard has always had problems with large number of players, but apparently they decided not to fix anything before the release of ow2."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"blizzard made a cool game update and the toxic community of the game is not used to new products. the only thing i can say is that the farm currency is too small, i would like blizzard to take this into account and make the farm easier, and that the battlepass would pay off after pumping. and so the top game, and in addition also for free, i speak as an old overwatch player since 2019 680 hours of play."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"no pve on release. free distribution model and absolutely inhuman monetization system. lack of normal server support on release. the gameplay has become more competitive and the game has become less arcade, overwatch should be arcade... few new content on release. there is not much new content on the release, and old skins now have to be bought for real money, are you crazy? and the most disgusting act of activision blizzard is turning off the servers of the first part, now the fans will not even be able to play the usual overwatch, and the game they bought is simply taken away and given a clown skin in return. activision blizzard  you are clowns."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"ignore the salty ones in the reviews. the game is a quantum leap from ow1. a lot more dynamic, fastpaced and less repetitive. new metas will arise and various very welcome improvements. seeing the stats of every player is heaven sent. new push mode is super fun. shieldless orisa is immensely aggressive. the new maps are works of art and super well built with local cultures very well represented portugal, brazil, ..... i also commend blizzard for at least attempting to fight off cheaters, smurfs and disruptive folks. let's be honest, of that that there was plenty in ow1. thank you. cut blizzard some slack and just enjoy the game for what it is. if you're facing issues, give them a few days to iron out the kinks that any game launch with this big of an audience is prone to have. thanks for a great update, blizz."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"i made this account just to leave a bad review for this game. ow2 is a complete downgrade compared to ow1. 3,5 years development for what? 3 chars that feel new because there are new and a battlepass that is worse then anything else. blizzard is dying, im so sad"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"much better than the first, the 5 vs 5 makes the game more punishing and gives importance to the tank role, the graphics engine gives a magnificent rendering and the new characters are very fun to play, i highly recommend to people who like challenges."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"worst release ever, at this point the entire payroll at blizzard is full of incompetent parasites from top to bottom. the video game world would be a better place if blizzard was forced to shut down right now. the greedy leadership on top of any employee that stayed at that toxic company and is enabling their anti consumer business models and strategies should be ashamed of themselves."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"what the hell is even this? this is not a sequel. it's a f2p, grindy ass battle pass content update. some  game, but f2p. seriously, what a scam. blizzard ."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"very nearly the same as ow1. they  off for multiple years just to rerelease a worse version of the same game. also locked behind sms now because  people who value their privacy and  poor people. the monetization is now a bp instead of lootboxes, but the battle pass in this game manages to be even more predatory than lootboxes lmao. you will need to be a neet who can play the game 247 to get one skin while ow1 gave out enough lootboxes to let everyone have a good chance at getting multiple cool cosmetics. they also lock new heroes at level 55 of the pass if you're f2p while premium players get them instantly because  you. the free path of the battlepass is utter  and has absolutely no cool items at all, even the below average items were all put on the premium section, so f2p players who actually have time to dedicate their entire ing life to grinding it won't get anything worthwhile but a new champion. the battlepass also doesn't even refund itself like passes do in just about every other game. ow1 also did let you grind out enough currency to get cool new event skins whenever they came out. that's gone now too. many heroes have had their cool techs and mechanics removed for no reason, and now matches are super reliant on tanks even more than ow1. they spent 4 ing years making this and all it is is a watered down ow1 with even worse monetization, and you can't even go back to play ow1 anymore either cause they shut it down. dog game and dog company. don't waste your money or your time. a slap in the face to everyone who liked ow1. also  critics for being paid shills."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"no. i'm sorry but no. a 50bln worth company, with close 20 years of dealing mainly with only games should not have any excuse for horrible launch such as this. it doesn't matter if ddos is involved or not. at this point we have lost several days of a 9 week schedule to level the level a battle pass if anyone is stupid enough to buy. a battle pass for which you get barely any experience even if you win. it's more than clear that the point of all this is to make you pay even more. where are my cosmetics blizzard? why is my account entirely blank as if this is the first time i've actually touched the game? when in fact i've been playing from day 1. why has no one responded to my support ticket for a 3 day? why am i in cue with 250k people in front of me for account merge considering i've linked my psn and bnet accounts 5 years ago? this is just sad. it's sad to see a game company that i grew up with, the one which basically got me into gaming, to see it turning into yet another greedy entity that inevitably collapse on itself. thank god that this was a f2p, it does help me decide whether or not i will risk any blizzard branded game in the foreseeable future."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"overwatch 2 is a prime example of how not to make a sequel. what do we have at the moment? nothing but the addition of aggressive monetization and some balance changes. there is nothing that we were shown a very long time ago, starting with weather phenomena and ending with the progression of heroes. briefly about how long it takes to earn a level 55 battle pass 6.5 levels per week, but if you play the game every 2 hours a day for 1 month, you can get a new character for free. in order to get 1 legendary skin, please complete weekly tasks for 9 months. thanks to blizzard for another ruined game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"at least we need a way to gain old currency rather than just pay 20 for a legendary skin. f2p mode doesn't mean that you can make players and its fans purchase for anything. almost 80 weeks, 7 seasons, 560 days, only to get a legendary skin in ow2. crazy."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"it's the worst update in the game industry ever. i've been a huge fan of overwatch, and i've played it since 2017. and i've been waiting for the new update so much. but instead of fun, i've received colossal disappointment. first of all, queues. really big queues. you can wait for hours to play this game. and when you've passed an exhausting long queue, the server crashes, and you need to wait in the queue again. secondly, terrible optimization. i've got a laptop that passes all system requirements for playing overwatch, but the game's crushing every 510 mins of gameplay. but ok, i've tried to play on the nintendo switch, and i can't pass phone confirmation it just doesn't work. thirdly, when i finally passed all circles of hell. i've noticed that there aren't any updates to call it overwatch 2 instead of overwatch 1.2. now this game it's just another lousy alternative to fortnite. shame on you, blizzard!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,not much has changed as far as matchmaking goes within competitive mode. trolls throughout the lower tiers. an occasional hacker here and there. i'm not confident that the new ranking system is going to judge ones individual performance vs the teams so prepare to be hard stuck like in ow1. i'm about to give up on the game. disappointed.

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"it's actually my first negative review on metacritic. this game made me so angry and disappointed that i really want to share my opinion with you. i've been playing overwatch since 2018 and it was my favourite competition game that i was in love with. i've spent 2000 hours playing it with my friend and met lots of people that we are in contact nowadays. overwatch 2 feels like a game with absolute no soul. it feels like it was made just to make money and that's it. i thought that 5v5 might be great system but i was completely wrong. it just made tanks overpowered and put you into fast pace, aggressive play style with no choice. every single game in open queue consists of 2 tanks at least that makes it unplayable. role queue is a bit more comfortable to play cuz roles are simply locked. the game itself feels like a raw meat that blizzard tries to feed us. absolutely 0 damage feedback, when u deal damage, when u receive damage, when u heal someone or being healed. i am not even considering this battle pass  i just want the game to be good, but blizzard just spit on your face with the second version of game. i really hope they are gonna return back 6v6 system and realize their mistakes. if not, you can consider blizzard as a dead company itself."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"il primo overwatch era un capolavoro, un capolavoro che ti premiava costantemente, in modo casuale, paragonabile al gioco d'azzardo, ma bilanciato, passava un po' di tempo ma ottenevi tutto ci che volevi. adesso invece ci troviamo di fronte ad un gioco castrato, 5 vs 5 anzi che 6 vs 6, riducendo il numero di tank, cosa insensata, uno sbilanciamento generale di rara bruttezza, con  depotenziati senza motivo e altri potenziati fino a diventare rotti, infatti vedi sempre gli stessi  che fanno l'azione della partita. in fine, la cosa pi grave di tutte, dato che il resto  sistemabile,  il metodo di business. il gioco  diventato un f2play della peggior specie, in cui tutto ci che  decente lo puoi avere solo se esci soldi, in cui ore di gioco ti fanno salire di 1 2 livelli, in cui il tuo tempo e la tua vita sono da sacrificare per avere meno della met dei contenuti che un tempo ti erano garantiti, in cui persino le skin del primo gioco non le puoi acquistare senza sborsare centinaia di euro. una vergogna vera, una macchina ruba soldi e spenna polli, senza neanche una valuta di gioco che ti permette col tempo di acquistare ci che apprezzi senza soldi veri. praticamente ormai giochi tanto per giocare, tanto non ottieni nulla, e onestamente per me questo si chiama sprecare il proprio tempo, non avere un vero motivo di tornare se non si viene manipolati e ingabbiati in questo malato meccanismo monopolizza vita. e la cosa divertente  che devi pure aspettare minuti e minuti di coda per cominciare a giocare e farti spennare, perch anche il semplice accesso al gioco richiede un'attesa folle...."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"first of all, publishers should never discontinue a game the day its sequel launches in an effort to get players to switch over. this alone needs to be rejected by the industry. overwatch 2 was initially advertised as a pve focused sequel, but somewhere along the development cycle blizzard decided to instead push out their 5v5 update as the full game, and replacement for overwatch 1. upon launch, you are greeted with the new, shop, and, battle pass, blizzard's monetization scheme for this title. the battle pass is a 10 recurring subscription which will include new heroes, skins, and eventually pve. activision blizzard seems to really want to generate even more profit from this title. 5v5 isn't going to be for everyone. the heroes, especially tanks, have been tweaked to deal more damage. the gameplay feels faster paced, more akin to apex legends or fortnite. the sounds feel more like they're trying to hard to be realistic, unlike the more pleasantly futuristic and fun sounds of the first game. if you prefer the first game, blizzard might eventually roll out 6v6 as an arcade mode, but we have no specifics on what abilities will be in that gamemode. disappointingly, blizzard discontinued the looking for group feature entirely. global chat has been removed, too. it feels like blizzard has lost their direction with this. sms protect has been a total disaster that gatekeeps players with prepaid phones. blizzard has tweaked this policy to allow players who played overwatch 1 this year to circumvent it entirely, however new players still need postpaid phone plans. it feels a lot like new players aren't going to enjoy the limitations imposed upon them, because half the hero roster is locked until they unlock them. this, in addition to sms protect, might make it annoying for new players to pick up the game. it feels more like a cash grab to get more money out of old players. lastly, activision blizzard didn't seem to beef up their server resources in preparation for this launch. all players are stuck in long queues, and console players have to wait exorbitant amounts of time for, the merge, of their accounts with . there are a plethora of bugs, such as one that removes the skins players had in the first game, and many old players are seeing their hero roster locked, as if they were new. 010, activision blizzard. bring back overwatch 1, and reclassify overwatch 2 as an open beta."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"the gameplay itself is quite good if you can get in, a return the pace of year 1 ow and moving to 5v5 seems to have solved a lot of the long term balance problems that plagued the game. new heroes are fun, performance is somehow even better despite updated graphics, and the roadmap looks bright providing they stick to it. content is a bit lacking but understandable given work on pvp only started post jeff and the bulk of development time went towards pve, so i'm going to withhold from complaining until i can see whether or not pve is actually worth it. servers are obviously in meltdown but that's a temporary problem. monetization on the other hand... i could begrudgingly see 10 but 20 for an individual skin is just excessive. even worse, the battle pass while otherwise decent gives zero currency and the only source in weeklies only results in 540 per season. 8 freaking months of grinding for a single legendary is beyond insulting."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"ill try to do this rate as more objective as possible. first of all, overwatch 2 could be better game and i have played 15 hours i have played ow1 since feb 2017. what i want to say. i did like 5x5 and especially junker queen. i liked new maps and new game mode. i even liked the idea to make ow f2p because it really could save overwatch. battle passes, store. it looks great. but it requires a good lets call it monetization grammar . and ow2 has great problems with it. first of all, there is a lot of donations. even for ow1 cosmetics that used to be free. you cant buy ow1 cosmetics for free if you dont have enough ow1 credits and you cant even earn them. one of the biggest mistake is heroes in battle pass. cmon blizzard, you serious? you can say that in apex, valorant, lol etc. you have to buy new characters too but it seems that developers forgot that overwatch is a game where you have to change heroes during a match to counter your enemy hero or enemy setup. no one gives a  about its free access 55 level of 80 seriously. a lot of donations even for casual cosmetics. even apex have more options to get some cool cosmetics for free. they have special currency to get this cosmetics for free. weekly challenges are not enough 60 per week. pls blizz, give players an opportunity to get more ow coins and give free premium bo for ow1 owners. giving ow1 owners a clown skin is humiliating. . and please for god sake, make more servers because its impossible to wait whole queue. all i wanna say is i hope that microsoft will save bluizzard games from that  that they are in right now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"so they took one of the best fps games ever made, altered it for the worse, and rereleased it with a really egregious micro transaction system. beyond that, you can't even really play it thanks to the connectivity issues. literally, i would've given it this score before the connection problem, now it deserves something even less."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-06,"the biggest problem is the incredible internal purchase and the game does not deserve to be called overwatch2. i support this 5v5 change, which increases the number of times that two teams face each other headon. but the update content is too little and the game is too subtle. sigma's pendant is directly in your hand? blizzard, you are so crazy"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"where to begin? overwatch 2, the sequel to overwatch 1. they removed a tank slot from the teams good bye queue times for tank, made a bunch of silly changes in the background to anonymize more players while weaponizing the report system for any sjw's. on top of that transcription of all voice recordings. gee, wonder why over 15 games only 1 person has spoken in chat. crazy. how about a scoreboard? nope, instead of adding that we took away ranks, so you don't even know what you're playing in ranked. kinda defeats the purpose. selling the original games cosmetics for tens of thousands of dollars. jittery frame rates even on low settings, on a 5000 rig. and of course, the ddos attack not real, they just weren't prepared for what i assume is a very embellished amount of players. none of the core issues of the first game seem to get addressed. balance is nowhere to be found. most of the maps are the old maps. new events will be the same events they've recycled since ow1. oh yeah, do you have a phone with an approved provider? it's the only way we even let you play, even if we stole your copy of ow1 and forced you to download 2 instead. once you get the phone figured out you pesky poor person be sure to play for dozens of hours to unlock base heroes. if you'd like you can buy our battlepass for fake digital crap. this allows us to milk consumers for more money because we had to circumvent loot box laws good job going after those in courts, gamers. that sure solved the problem. the only thing worse than a bad game is a bad game everyone plays. don't play this pos. it does nothing new enough to even warrant being called a sequel while simultaneously making several things much, much worse. you know, if you could even log in."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"i played overwatch for over 500 hours, and i was really hyped for overwatch 2. i shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. the credit system is one of the greediest i have seen in a while, they removed fun features for no reason, and the gameplay is just a deathmatch. i can understand the server issues, but i can't understand what blizzard has been doing for three and a half years on this game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"i have been fooled, i am not sure how i could be so naive and expect anything from blizzard. they are the worst behaving company from all game producers after all. overwatch was a nice game in 2016, some people played it until today others like me stopped from boredom in 20182019. those who continued to play will be happy with overwatch 2, because it is exactly a clone of the first one. same visuals, same maps, same heroes, same abilities, same servers, same progression, same skins. it is a rather small balancing patch and a interface change, so your entry screen is modern now. i can not recall any big game company being that devious to clone a 7 year old game and rerelease it f2p plus cashshop with a ton of marketing. if you did not want to play overwatch anymore don't start with overwatch 2, it's the same game. well minus the progression, as your old account was merged you already start maxed out with no goals. if you never tried overwatch and don't mind the outdated graphics and that most players are veterans already, you can try. it's free after all."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,this is not overwatch 2 this is overwatch 1 modern gaming edition disguised as overwatch 2.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,server
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,main problems now no level system poor server performance on release lack of free content battle pass doesn't pay off you should spend a lot of time to unlock heroes
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"it is impossible to play. and i'm not saying this because it has bugs or anything like that, i'm saying this because i literally can't play it. 28 hours after its launch and i still can't pass the queues to log in the game, that on pc and on xbox series x. on top of that, blizzard's support account, the game's official account have simply vanished from the internet because they know the mess they've put themselves into this release."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,with only 1 tank allowed per team if that guy isn't very good and the other team's tank is elite.... get ready to be dominated and possibly spawn camped match after match after match. after struggling to connect to servers for hours after playing about 35 matches i had enough as it's just the same old ow but without the ez lootboxes to obtain and a pos battlepass. plus the game is such a sweat fest in unranked you have no chance of trying out a new hero unless you wanna get steam rolled.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,for most games this would be considered a patch not a sequel not much new content a cash grab and nothing more. the 5v5 model is less fun and more rigid than the previous game dont waste your bandwidth or time
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"a clear cash grab by a failing company. characters locked behind paywalls, boring grinds, and a all backed by 'content creators' aka blizzard shills. this couldn't be a bigger disappointment."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"wow the same characters, same maps, same connection issues. blizzard does it again!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"i'm not going to talk about the appauling server issues or even the extortionate monetisation. the actual game itself is terrible. over the past 6 years i've played ow1 more than any other and with this they have taken everything that made the first one good and stripped it. tanks and healers are basically useless while the dps get to play their own power fantasies of destroying everything on the map. the game is way too fast and the ttk is ridiculously quick. some firefights last literally seconds. honestly i dont know wtf blizzard were thinking but the only positive thing i can say is that the graphics are nice. i would have rather they just continued updating overwatch 1 instead of this  3 years of content we lost ao they could focus on this. this game is a slapin the face and the worst thing about it is that i cant even play ow1 anymore because this soulless abomination killed it and has possessed its corpse. not even worth a play, you're better off playing paladins as its better than this crap"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"so many bugs you'd swear it was never tested. while it's not their fault for the ddos, it's unfortunate it's the worse version of ow1. a giant excuse to monetize their game, and ruin the 6v6 system"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"game won't run on windows 7 so i can't play anymore, and they shut down overwatch 1."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,completely unplayable game. blizzard have even deleted my overwatch account. overwatch 2 is a scam.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"downloaded this to play with friends, proceeded to wait a least an hour  to get on. got booted once i got through everything and was told to relaunch. this game is a comedy of errors."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"after 15 years of  releases it going to be a bad joke, blizzard.  some players cant even start the game, because fragile ow2 cant work with overlays, led tuners and fps showers. everyone else can, but ow2. mkay  players who can start the game wait for the queue, you placed 100, 50, 10, 50000. gj.  cis players just cant even install the game. without any announce. so i am have ow1 and can install ow2, but my friend who just waiting for f2p ow2 even can't download game cuz launcher just hide it from him.  45 hour battle pass, nuff said.  some ppls even ow1 owners have no characters or skins because profiles is broken.  you now need set up phone number in your account to play ow2.  if you have prepaid mobile plan, you can't set this up."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"literally the same game, literally the same crashes, but now with long login queues."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"the most greedy game developer. all they've done in 3 years is the battle pass. no story company, no graphics improvements. only battle pass and paid heroes."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"just another cheap overwatch knock off ... i don't know how blizzard calls this as overwatch2, technically blizzard lied to all of us and delivered a rushed rubbish game ... user interface is bad character balance doesn't exist , and some characters just dont fit into this fast paced game style it's downgraded overwatch 1 ,why doesn't it have the pve ? at least you need this to redeem your self .. horrible decision to make the game 5v5 in the end it's just a scam and not fun to play anymore"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,it's not even a game. it's an infinity false queue. thais is the prove how critics reviews are totally false. 81100? really? what a shame.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,it's just an update to old overwatch adding microtransactions and switching to 5v5 instead of 6v6. plus as always blizzard servers in europe are crap and every new release makes players wait in queues forever and kick players out of the game after one match.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"the only reason this game is considered a sequel is so they can skirt around the promises made when you bought overwatch 1. this game is a cash grab, skins are 20, paid battlepass, and horrible servers. as someone who played overwatch competitively its depressing to see what they are doing with this game. its clear why jeff kaplan left, blizzard is going down the drain and its depressing. i hope this game flops and burns, bring back the original overwatch."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"awful. please fire all the design team, the ui is crap. it used to be nice, to have a charm, great effects, now it doesn't follows any guide line, colors all are over the place, and things in general are harder to read, or understand. also, character portraits."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,approximately 20 of players cannot play the game simply due to their phone plan. the developers preached high and mighty ideals of inclusiveness but reneged on their promises the first chance they got. i am not exaggerating that for individuals with certain phone plans this game is quite literally unplayable. step up blizzard and fix this.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"look how they massacred my boy . another great franchise completely destroyed by greed and anticonsumerism. activision blizzard are some scumbag liars by saying overwatch 1 would be crosscompatible with overwatch 2. not to mention lying again by saying that you wouldn't be needing your overwatch 1 coins for overwatch 2 and to spend them while you still can. newsflash, you can get items easily with the overwatch 1 coins, it's almost as if they made us all waste our coins from overwatch 1 to use their new currency that you have to pay real money for! overwatch does not need to have live service bs implemented into it and definitely does not need to be pay to win. overwatch is the kind of game where you switch heroes to counter the enemy team which is exactly why heroes should not be locked behind a paywall for this particular game! if you haven't bought the battle pass to get a certain character that is powerfulbroken, guess what, you lose! fun!!! battle pass differential!!! this really used to be something special back in 20162017 and they just pissed all over its iconic glory. this just goes to show that companies can very easily kill off a franchise by being greedy corporate scumbags. no wonder jeff from the overwatch team left. rip overwatch 20162022, ruined and desecrated by activision blizzard. tf2 here i come!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"the new battle pass is a banger!! i have never ever seen a progression system like this in any videogame!!! blizzard has worked so hard to import old maps from the first game, it's just insane! for the past 3 years developers had really outdone themselfs, they even added three new heroes!!! i'm looking forward to see what future updates will bring to the table. personally, i hope they do something with current meta. please nerf mercy by disabling her ability to walk she is obviously too strong!!! and some characters need a buff... maybe give junkrat an extra mine or too? he's just too weak, even since the first game! i sincerely hope blizzard will continue to develop this new and exiting installment in franchise, the least we can do as players, is to support them by just playing the game! i can't wait to spend 8 months of my life grinding for 1 legendary skin!"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"i personally find it really hilarious how a goty ended up like this loooooool. this has to be the biggest joke in gaming ever. i have to use a phone number just for chat??! considering the ties blizzard has with china..... it makes it kinda sus...... oh, this game is a freetoplay game? already that makes it a scam as nothing is actually free. it has an awful battle pass, and in general the least normal game ever. can these types of games please die out? who are the dumb people still buying and playing blizzard products nowadays? don't let megacorporations psychologically manipulate and abuse you. overwatch cursed gaming and i will never forgive blizzard for it. heck, blizzard in general cursed gaming with their drug, i mean mmo called wow. it's the whole reason why we game as a service. what happened to games with stories? games that told something? games with fun gameplay? music? please avoid this game like the plauge."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"the biggest change for me was a removal of 1 tank. incredible how many things this have changed. while original game was a shield destroying fest especially when it's reinhardt x orisa or sigma, now it's more fast, more attacking for both dps and tanks. however i feel that gameplay for healers didn't change much. tanks are now so fun to deal damage to. they are practically unkillable, because healers in 5v5 have more resources to sustain them. and this is fun. not a game for everyone where 12 people play and one person can't make much difference and noone gets offended. no more a game where elo hell is more real than anywhere else. at first i thought that ui is mobilelike, didn't like the idea, but in fact it just feels fresh and works well with both improved ui animations i.e. ult glow and new hero select animations. rome map feels fresh too, and you see that they worked on postprocessing, colors look picturesque. also new push game mode is kinda fun to play. new scoreboard. finally. now it's no more a game for snowflakes and easily offended people. not a game that should make you feel comfortable and just fill in the player spot in a match. now you can actually see how your team performs, how you perform and plan accordingly now to things i don't like junker queen has a very tiny hitbox, and a looot of hp for that hitbox imagine tracer with 400 hp, which makes her a very difficult target and, well, unbalanced. new battle pass system... let's be honest, we are okay with this system in apex legends, but here... it just doesn't fit. you buy a battle pass for what reason? to have skins all other players have? skin distribution system back in the days told a story  you opened hard earned pack and got a legendary skin for your favourite character. or you spent a handful of currency to buy just this one skin you like. this system i liked is no more. yes, game servers can't take this much load first few days. we see it in all blizzard games. yes, compared to original game, you wait 2 minutes to find a game on dps instead of 10mins. this shows how dead and abandoned and forgotten the original game was. and this is blizzard's fault. 10 out of 10 because of offended people here hitting 0. in fact 8 out of 10 bc it's super fun to play"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"the game has become a piece of  prepare 12,000 dollars. and you can't connect a phone number if you have a cheap data plan."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,they removed overwatch 1 from my library. i paid money for that. i feel scammed. this is warcraft 3 refunded all over again. they learned nothing and they don't care. launch day 2. servers are still broken. 80 players ahead of me for ages. the queue count is lying to my face.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"overwatch released back in 2016 to massive love from everyone, winning game of the year even yet 6 year later blizzard figured out how to screw up the launch of its sequel to the massive and popular game that so many used to love as many have already pointed out the launch was a complete disaster to everyone including blizzard themselves 2 ddos attacks not to far from each other, a queue that makes any mmorpg player think they had it already worse with any new expansion launch, account not receiving there ow1 progress back rank, coins, cosmetics ect require to have a sms to verify as of blizzard new way to prevent banned players to easily get back in overwatch 2 plans to become free to play was made for many people as a good intention but in reality blizzard had a different idea for why it had plans to go to f2p a idea of how to profit more from it fans overwatch 2 uses now a battle pass and paid ingame currency to make the game profit instead of doing its old yet classic and nostalgic lootboxes new players who want to unlock everything would need to pay 12k to unlock all skins this sequel feels more like a 1.1 rather than. actual feel sequel would we recommend playing the game? currently at launch like this no"

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"returning players have all of their progress reset. no more skins, need to unlock each hero. need to win however many games until you can play competitive, 100 games i think?. as someone with over 1000 hours on the original game this kind of . on top of that there isn't a single quickplay game where there isn't a leaver, so your odds of winning just depends on which team gets the leaver. 5v5  too. other than that it's the same game. they just made all the day time maps night time, and all the night time maps day time and called it a day."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"thank you blizzard. deleting one tank role is like fresh air and add more action in game. game plays smoothly. one problem and it is log wait to enter the game because of queue, but it's release so it's ok for now."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"imagine a world where blizzard released a game that didnt ask for your money via microtransactions before the game was in a playable state. those dummies that paid 40 dollars for a f2p game before it even released, never received the goods and are clogging the forums with complaints. those that paid for ow1 can no longer access those features, skins, etc that they already paid for, as ow1 was outright deleted and replaced by ow2. players who dont have a postpaid phone contract cant play. and this is all if you get through their awesome server queue. if you do manage to get in a game, you might be notice that .  the entire game looks like its copy pasted ow1 just 5v5 instead of 6v6 and new monitization. really nailed it once again blizz. guess they didnt learn the first 2 times they set records recently for worst metacritic user scores for their games. we all admittedly hide behind these eloquent critiques and civil words and sentences. after seeing what you did on diablo immortal, wc3 reforged, the sexual harassment rampant in your offices, the lackluster release cadence across all of your franchises, and now this lazy cashgrab   we only really have 2 words we really want to say. were all thinking it. these arent kind words such as thank you or well done."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"this is an unfortunate mess for the game. servers are down huge queue times, and lots of microtransactions. what used to be a fun game and series has now dropped everything that made the game fun. one of the biggest parts of overwatch was its loot boxes. although i love the decision to remove loot boxes from the game, there is no longer any way to obtain cosmetics for free. a 3yearold skin now costs about 20. for someone who bought the 100 dollar version of overwatch 1 i no longer am able to unlock the skins previously in the game, no i have to buy them. there are no more levels, and credits are no longer obtainable. for owning overwatch 1 you are given 2 skins that i will probably never use and you are able to use the new hero instantly. i think i should at least get the battle pass for free as well. you can however obtain the premium currency for free, but only 500 which is about 5 worth. this is not enough to buy the battlepass and this only encourages you to buy more credits. these are terrible mechanics to steal people's money. blizzard does not need any more money, they are a 50 billion dollar company, please stop defending them. i have seen many people defend them online saying overwatch needs to make money to survive, they just put out diablo immortal and in the first 3 days they made over 100 million in sales."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"they simply added a few heroes and maps to the old game, and they call it 2. they used to add much more to the original game years ago. this game is like a joke now. let people select to play ow 1, it is much better than this thing. they couldn't even make a good launch, lots of people can't even reach the main menu after waiting for so long..."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,i'm in awe at how incredibly stupid the sms protect is. i never imagined i'd see the day that i can't play a game because of my cellular service provider... they just effectively locked out a portion of their own audience lmao.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"joke game, joke players, joke streamers, joke esports. joke 75 characters requirement."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,can't rate a game that i can't play lmao. maybe if the company was less greedy in the beta phase then this wouldn't have happened
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"everything is identical to the first one except for the fact its 5v5, lazy cucks"
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,overwatch  greed  overwatch 2 blizzard is destroying every franchise they are owning with massive greed.
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,"main problem is the server performance  long queues and frequent disconnects. if you manage to get into the game after a long wait then what you see is the new modernised menu and a new tier system, which i personally prefer over the previous loot boxes. however the freemium element ruins it for me. gameplay itself feels as a significant downgrade, where first game was about teamwork the new instalment has fewer shield and stun abilities, making the game feel simply chaotic."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2022-10-05,there is nothing new to change the name of the game to 2. it's just a bit of a makeover. blizzard made a fool of those who paid for the first game.
