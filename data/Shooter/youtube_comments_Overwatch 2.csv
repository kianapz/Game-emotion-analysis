HOWEVER, he gets super hard if you don't have teammates peel for you, and he's not the one for Solo-que. He's really good though, and in the heat of the moment, I dare say fun. Learn your matchups against other tanks, and what you have to change to adjust your playstyle, and you can run Mauga against any team comp with success. However, if your supports are not on you, you will feel that instantly.",0
Em8hY09zi7c,@davidwaddell785,2025-02-27T19:06:00Z,"Sombra needs help, but it's unplayable.  As far as perks go, her CTRL ALT Escape and White Hat perks could use some love.  The critical health requirement could be removed from the escape perk and it still wouldn't be amazing, and the 4s cool down on white hat is a joke.  100 heals every 5 seconds is really low heals per second, less than half of a support, and can get interrupted by getting hit.  Lowering the cool down to 1.25 seconds, or less, is what would put Sombra in the same category as a support, so I don't think a 2 second hack cool down on heal would be too much to ask.",0

The ana crit is a bait imo. It's only 1.5x mutiplier. I'd only consider it if I had a 100% free game and my other support is soaking up all the heals.

frag launcher perk (the faster proj. speed) messes with your aim, junkrat aim is built on muscle memory of knowing how precisely your bombs travel, and while if it would be cool to have it early to get accustomed to increased speed, this is a major perk, 70% of the match you dont have it, you only got to use it for remaining 30%, it would benefit from splitting faster nades from dafault speed with a short wind-up similar to orisa spear perk

mine perk suffers not because of itself, but by everyone else, every single character has a way to destroy, evade or survive the mine, causing this perk to be niche, its kind of an unredeemable perk and needs to be replaced with sth new

All her major perks are net nerfs in the long run.

 The healing perk causes you to locks on to allies, and EMP not healing allies also is a a shame,the only postive is that you get a faster Ult chatge by healing your allies. 

The longer hack perk makes your hacking range so short that you might as well have to be kissing the enemy team to get to hack them(which you don't always want to be that close when playing Sombra),and don't even try hacking flyers with that perk,they will be out of reachüòÇ,the on my postive is that it help lockout supports like Ana and Moria for longer,so its easier to kill then when they are hacked.",11

Progression means that you can level up characters, collect stuff, change their abilities (loadouts in TF2) and completely redesign your favorite characters as you prefer and suits you.
These perks you've added during match is just 2%...
All you had to do was to add these perks / talents in the MAIN MENU! One big MAIN talent trees that will require account level.
Also separately add abilities - Active / Passive FOR EVERY SINGLE HERO! and also add progression to them - levels 10 max, on max level you will unlock every ability to choose from.
Season pass also in other games costs around 5 to 10$ - in OW2 - 20000000$ which is Bullshit! Make it affordable for everyone, if I have enough money, doesn't mean that I have to feed greedy devs. (before someone starts joking how broke I am)
Make CO-OP missions FREE for everyone! - MAKE MONEY ONLY WITH COSMETICS FFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And for god sake, remove 2 from title. Rename to Overwatch again.

OybTKceHWQ8,@mogar5666,2025-02-26T23:50:42Z,"Ive been a fan of OW since release. It was my go-to game, nothing felt as rewarding or hit the dopamine like OW1. I was also an early tester of OW2. I wasnt as frustrated at spending 15 CAD on a BP until they took out a large chunk of skins and got lazy with mythics. Theres no real customization anymore. It's just 'add on a piece or two' like shoulder plates for level 2, and at lvl 4 make it glow. The only thing that varies with skins is the handful of colours.

They showed they cared more about money than quality. Even these perks are recycled, probably ""ready to go"" (obviously not in a literal sense) and I just cant shake off how OW felt more like it only cared to take money from the top 1% of people who will spend all their money on the game's skins for the same 3 characters rather than throw a bone to give love to any other aspect of the game.

Venture didnt even have a legendary at release, and it seemed like that was the route they were going forward with every hero after.

Marvel rivals is a lot more friendly when it comes to monetization than OW. I could buy a great skin just by playing! Not to mention it felt REWARDING to play because they had missions that werent just 'play x amount of games. If you win, you gotta play the game a little less'",0
OybTKceHWQ8,@AlderanZ,2025-02-26T23:11:56Z,"Of course they didn't make this update in the last couple of months, they were probably saving it as an emergency or for way later -- but they are being forced to release it right now.

They are so toned-deaf and show so little care for the game, that maybe they would never have bothered to even finish and release the new systems, it if it wasn't for the threat of Marvel Rivals.",0

OybTKceHWQ8,@TheRoyal30,2025-02-26T22:35:32Z,"I'll admit that OW has been the game I've played more than anything since 2020. I believe I have over 1500 hrs or something like that so I have rose-colored glasses to a certain point. While the announced changes make things seem very promising, the perks just didn't do it for me this season. It's a nice change and I'm sure it really improves how others feel about it which is valid.

I want OW to thrive because it has been a fantastic game for a lot of people. I'm hopeful that Stadium will provide that really different gameplay that will keep things fresh. It looks fun and seems so distinct that it could feel like a completely different game. If it delivers, the only thing I can see killing it is too large of gaps in time between hero additions to the mode.",0

Muitas das coisas anunciadas ai j√° est√£o rodando dentro do jogo como teste a meses, antes mesmo do MR sair. Nem tudo √© por que ""a agua bateu na bunda""....

Perks - Eles testaram isso seasons atr√°s, deixando claro que os testes eram para ver se ficaria vi√°vel colocar no jogo e se fosse eles colocariam sim
6x6 - Testaram (e ainda testam) a muito tempo como voltar, tanto que est√£o fazendo esse modo por temporadas (o pr√≥ximo √© o GOATS da brig), mas eles j√° deixaram claro que o modo 6x6 n√£o teve resultados bons, a maioria dos players n√£o gosta mais do jogo assim mas mesmo assim est√£o mantendo o modo nas temporadas.
Artes conceituais - Fazem a muito tempo tamb√©m, inclusive eles fazem sempre vota√ß√µes para quais skins vir√£o. Essas DokiDoki mesmo apareceram meeeses atras nessas pesquisas.
Modo hist√≥ria - Eles lan√ßaram sim, mas como a comunidade reclamou de como foi lan√ßado, como se fosse uma season de destiny2, eles est√£o segurando o que j√° fizeram e estudando uma outra forma de continuar, enquanto isso n√£o acontece, eles deixaram claro que est√£o melhorando o PVP j√° que √© o principal do jogo.

Tudo isso chegou oficialmente agora pq? O ano de OW come√ßa sempre em fevereiro, ent√£o as mudan√ßas grandes, principalmente as que impactam o competitivo, vem por agora, mas tudo isso est√° dentro do jogo e sendo testado desde antes do MR ser lan√ßado. 

Ent√£o o que pode ser considerado sim uma resposta a MR??

Modo arena e 3¬™ pessoa
Eles est√£o dando mais skins gratuitamente
Volta das lootboxes

I don't like the increased randomness and unpredicability, but mostly, I just don't like timed mechanics like this, for some reason I've always felt stressed out by time sensitive mechanics, be it timers, or things like sojourns mechanic that powers down if you're not shooting, hell even temporary buffs like the Witcher 3 shrines.

Things like that just make me stressed, and feel a ton of pressure, like I've got to make the most of it, it, be at my best. I know that's not true, but I can't shake the feeling, and it's turned overwatch 2 from my comfort game into something that feels like it's just not for me anymore.

Xt2-ouHX2z0,@okajkaraca5013,2025-02-26T17:24:47Z,Some perks are literally just buffs that can easily be implanted in the game (like cleanse on lifeweaver grip or piercing with zarya),36
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@BrianWhoopWhoop1,2025-02-26T17:10:09Z,Why does everyone hate mercy‚Äôs perks? I LOVE THEMMMMMM,2
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@lsdxiii,2025-02-26T17:06:09Z,Junkrat's perks are super underwhelming and his only two good ones come with drawbacks if you use them.,2
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@Kidkingforyou,2025-02-26T16:52:25Z,Perks have made the game fun! I play a lot of weaver and every one of his perks should be baseline IMO. He still feels unfinished. Aside from pedal placements when you have two weavers on each team it sucks seeing our healing being equal because there is no expression with it at all.,15
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@JustaGuy_Gaming,2025-02-26T15:55:49Z,"I think when we all first heard about perks we hoped for something like what they have in Team Fortress 2 and the way different equipment drastically changes how the character plays. Sadly we did not get that. Two perks per tier, two tiers. Most hero's have one blatantly useful perk and another that is situational at best. Leading to most people all picking the same perk....",3
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@QT_Jeanne,2025-02-26T15:51:24Z,"I kinda wish each hero gets a lot of perks to choose from instead of one or two. Instead of nerfing perks add new ones that might attract the players. There are a lot of missed potential for characters like Moira who should have a perk that lets her combine both orbs and one that lets her heal tremendously but consumes more healing capacity like in the old days, Symmetra to have shield generator back (no shield battery doesn‚Äôt count), Sombra needs invisibility as a ability and not tied to translocator.

And perks are easy to tweak since they are additions rather than core abilities, players can live without the perks so adding more wouldn‚Äôt be much issue",0
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@worldwarAA,2025-02-26T15:42:03Z,"Perks are good in general. When you analyze it hero to hero, you certainly find heroes with obviously better perks. Ana‚Äôs perks are too powerful, she gets a ton of utility and survivability without trading off anything, whereas mercy has to give up something to get a mediocre healing ability. We all know that mercy didn‚Äôt need more healing, she needed more offensive capabilities and double dmg beam is not it. I wish they would just give us the Mercy ult from that event when she could dmg and heal with a skillshot on valk. Stop that bullshit of ‚Äúthe hero fantasy‚Äù cause when they want, they throw that away when reworking heroes or even with perks.",2
Xt2-ouHX2z0,@Chris-md8nt,2025-02-26T15:28:16Z,"I love perks but they definitely flopped with support. Brig has 2 very strong but boring perks and 2 niche perks i will never choose. The constant 10hp per second on LW is really underrated though, pair it with superbloom and you are a really tanky duelist.",4

Not to mention, Papa Jeff left Overwatch as well, which was the final nail in the coffin for me. So i haven't played( other than custom games) since OW ended. it was really disappointing what they did to this IP. I was so excited to see the world develop and built; i found the characters to be quite interesting, so much so i had pre-ordered Overwatch when it was first launched. Then OW2 happened üòûüòû

Seeing this tho, which i'm glad i did,  makes me optimistic about at least the PvP of the game since it has one of my favorite character/hero to play in games: Widowmaker. i'd hop in time to time just to play widow HS lobbies but if what he's saying in this video is accurate, then i'll have to give the core game a try again. I'm still not spending a dime on it tho.",0

I didnt care at all for the pve stuff they wanted to add to try and make this game an MMO, but being able  to build a character differently was such a good idea for a hero shooter to help its longevity and still keep things fresh without adding a new hero.

The difference is night and day to me - extra mitigation served to balance the supports' broken AoE utility by making it so it had to be timed right to when both tanks' guards were down, and the off tank being able to peel for supports and backline dps took off a bunch of the pressure for them when it came to facing down dive. Hell, a lot of the supports who enjoy being a powerhouse protector in 5v5 can then just make the jump to off tank in 6v6 since its effectively the same playstyle, which means that the roles' queue times will balance out much better.",4

And was super excited for the comp test and then it turns out to be open queue. I would be happy if they left the 2-2-2 queue in the arcade patched it twice a year and left it at that but saying hey we‚Äôre Doing 6v6 and then announcing it‚Äôs open queue is just disrespectful to the people who know 6v6 is better.",1

*swift strike deals 25 additional damage (passively healed by supports that arnt aware of the 25 dmg) and ONLY IF YOU USE IT SHORTLY AFTER GETTING AN ELIMINATION?!
Like wtf is this supposed to help genji do? It only happens after you successfully get the kill, which is the hard part. 

Double jump reset I guess helps you dodge sleep dart. But hit scans don't care about it. 

All this passive health gain stuff is the only viable option. But it doesn't change anything about his game play. Like If your genji and you execute well, you normally don't even take critical dmg. So self healing hardly aplys to genji, this should go on some other character.",0

Par contre : 

- Les fran√ßais ici qui parlent de lore en utilisant les traductions pourries pour les noms des h√©ros (Chacal ou Ange √ßa n'existe juste pas dans le lore d'Overwatch)
- Les fran√ßais ici qui se moquent du nom du h√©ros alors que le titre VO de la vid√©o va parfaitement avec le nom du h√©ros et que, bah r√©f√©rence au danger bact√©riologue bio hazard en fait...
- Les fran√ßais ici qui se moquent du manque de charisme du nouveau h√©ros alors que les VF sont juste nazes depuis toujours niveau doublage et traduction et pire depuis quelques ann√©es
- Les fran√ßais ici qui se moquent des dialogues alors que, bah les traductions sont effectivement bien pourries
- S√©rieusement, au-del√† de la remise en question, faudrait vraiment vous mettre √† l'anglais en 2024, on a des cours depuis le primaire et depuis les ann√©es 90 hein

Perso je suis tomb√© sur cette version fran√ßaise par hasard dans mes notifications sur les toilettes, et bien j'ai imm√©diatement regard√© la vraie vid√©o (en VO donc) sur le PC juste apr√®s. Pas moins d√©√ßu du contenu mais au moins la vid√©o est de qualit√© contrairement √† cette version compl√©tement plomb√©e par la VF et la traduction, comme d'habitude.

Overwatch was the nail in the coffin and Blizzard is on the decline to being a dead company in the next probably 10-15 years. Possibly sooner.

S_Sw393dP18,@bguzman8581,2024-12-16T05:56:55Z,"Overwatch devs. I mean this in a good way: stop responding to anything Marvel Rivals-related or thinking about them at all. So far some responses to Rivals' critique make you sound like a sports coach who gets heated up with no control over his emotions whenever there's good competition. Just relax, focus on what you're doing, give your community what it wants(or what you promised them), and don't rush things. The most important thing is to calm down bc there's always going to be hype around different games like for example there was a lot of hype for Helldivers, Space Marine, and Wukong, rn is Marvel rival's turn it doesn't mean that you won't get yours again. 

Keep up the good work ;)

GqZBekBmG-g,@ExperimentalJr,2025-02-22T14:45:44Z,"We all know why Kiriko, Juno and Dva get so many skins each season. Blizz knows exactly who will buy those skins and know that they are the ones that are most assiduous, just look at what those three have in common and you will find out, if you haven't already. I can even put Mercy and Widow in here even tho they aren't exactly made for the same ""demographic"", they have certain aspects in their character and design that falls into the same demographics as Juno, Kiri and Dva.

They know people who likes Hog/Ram/Venture/Sigma/Soujourn/Winston etc won't get as much skins as the others because characters that look and/or sound like grumpy adults or aren't barely reaching their adulthodd (in terms of looks and voices) won't sell as much as the ones that, even if not intentional (which I strongly doubt) were made with a very specific demographic in mind, and unfortunately, it won't chage since these are OW2 bread makers in terms of cosmetics.",0

When Blizzard scrapped Overwatch 2, they scrapped the project many people had been preparing for their entire lives. Overwatch may have been a marketable PvP model, but Overwatch 2 was going to be the story of hope and making a difference these people had been dying to tell.

The current state of the world may feel like one big bad decision, but the small choices like these are what led us to where we are today. Choosing money over a dream.",3

1. You are almost completely at the mercy of your teammates. If they dont push the objective or defend it, you lose, if they dont stay together then theres also a good chance you lose and if the supports either dont heal you or only heal you then you lose

2. You are also at the mercy of metas, often Tank metas force both tanks to play the same tank, one goes Mauga, the other has to mauga, one goes Zarya, that happens because its easy to make them more powerful than their actual counters, which is stupid af on Blizzards part, thats when it literally just becomes a battle of attrition each fight",0

BUT cause tank heroes are really strong on paper (some tanks can 1v3 depends on player ofc) they need to be countered by the enemys team. And this leads us to even more suffering as a tank player cause you play basically the strongest heroes in terms of pure stats and EVERYONE wants you to not play the game (CC, mei, reaper, orbs, nade and even enemy tanks like mauga) and thats not fun xd. And if your team doesnt play for counter their countres (like long range into reaper mei, kiriko for nade etc) you will suffer or play mauga\orisa to at least counter their tank.

I just dont understand the thought process.. This is without considering how easy it is to actually balance and introduce DPS versus Support and Tank to a Meta... Idk who thought it would be smart to have Damage double and triple the amount of options over the other two on release.. DPS should have been the least roster spots used and then release a DPS character every time a set of characters is added.. That way you could have also tested and had a good grasp on the meta.

But I think it more illustrates just how easily designing a character can go wrong Ana is essentially the original kiri of her time except she‚Äôs honestly more fair in a lot of contexts. Point being debuffs and stuns affect tanks disproportionately and even more so in 5v5 where it‚Äôs even easier for supports generally speaking it creates this horrible pinch point where unless you‚Äôre willing to deal with Ana as a tank literally every single time theirs just no point in queuing and yaknow I‚Äôm bad at the game I admit that but man is it not boring to play against. tanks swap I think like three times more than supports on average yet every single time I play tank the enemy supports always goes Ana by default.,0

Asking for a repeal and for what the ban was about was absolutely pointless. Overwatch completely lost me at that point. I dont care how fun the game is or ever will be. I won't spend my time where I'm not wanted. Fast forward to earlier last month and I called Venture a ""she"" in OWCS Twitch chat, completely oblivious to the fact that ""THEY"" are non-binary.

OapOJzGbCak,@Nekroido,2025-02-27T08:29:18Z,"Pro-tip on getting the chat logs: request the dump of your personal data through support ticket. You'll receive a giant HTML file with logs of transactions, acquisitions, and your own chat messages in all played Blizzard games.

And also, I'm yet to see a player writing the n-word (some see my name and decide to be racist and dyslexic) without consequences. Sometimes justice is swift, sometimes it takes about a week. Although I'm in EU region, so maybe it's a little different. But overall I feel your frustration, and it is warranted. Customer support and chat moderation are the easiest system to automate with natural language precessing since a lot of tasks are simple and repetitive. And the majority of issues mentioned have been around for at least a decade (remember TreeBoyDave?), so I would definitely blame non transparent ToS interpretation and default unfriendly treatment of customers by Blizz support staff.",1

Thing is, i'm still playing on an alt account. all blizzards done is meaninglessly taken away years of gameplay and work from me. genuinely so silly. they have an auto filter thing for chat too, so what's the point of banning people who say things that dont even violate that? and if theyre gonna go as far as to permban someone over chat, why not just stop the chat from being sent in the first place? rivals has a blocker in place that stops people saying things they dont like. why not just have a blacklist on overwatch too? id much rather not be able to send a msg than be banned a few days later where i wont even know what i got banned for.",2

Help me understand (do not send me a link for Terms of Use or Code of Conduct). At this point (30 day suspension) is the player not supposed to/allowed to interact with anyone playing the game. My account has held high endorsement level and been playing since 2016 without issue until 2024/25, yet ""You were reported multiple times"" is enough to silence/suspend play. Since OW2's release account penalty IS more easily being handed out with bad judgement (automated legal precedent attached to vague terms and community interpretation; a capitalist's asinine approach catering to the engagement of players for profit). I should not be afraid to communicate  in fear of account ban because of misinterpretation of vague conduct. I'm tired of having to play a multiplayer team based game in complete silence, as if I'm suppose to be a bot without the ability to influence team play regardless of game mode (cosmetic focused ping system is a band-aid in a fast paced shooter). Every player using in-game communication channels inherit the risk of being silenced/suspended/banned due to an abused report system lacking context. I want to interact, I want to engage, but the conditions of 'unique reports' over X games have the power to penalized innocence. Players have the ability to mute/block/avoid at their discretion yet many are falsely being penalized due to not communicating or playing under the umbrella of what Microsoft and those who report find acceptable.",0

Only ban severe repeat offenders who constantly troll & shit on teammates with abusive comments after multiple mutes and warnings, and just permaban hate speech. It doesn't have to be complicated.",0
OapOJzGbCak,@yousukeatagi8073,2025-02-26T23:14:23Z,"This is kind of a separate topic but got my account wrongfully suspended for abusive chat and I decided for the first time to buy an account (completely fresh, no qp games nothing, basically just paying $5 for a burner number) to play while I wait for the suspension to lift. I change the e-mail and password right away as you are supposed to and I was perma'd before I even got to play. Game was never even launched, probably just got flagged for the sudden changes to the account details (e-mail said gameplay violation LMAO). So I said fuck it what's another $5 so I bought another and just didn't change the account information to see if it would be ok. I get to actually play for a couple of days and literally as I am finishing my comp placements (predicted to place at my main rank, not smurfing) I get perma'd again for ""gameplay violation"". 

Tbh this whole vendetta they have against alt accounts would actually be reasonable if they didn't just go around suspending and banning people for illegitimate reasons (yes I flame people yes i curse big fucking whoop). And then flag your device or ip for actually wanting to keep playing their game. To me it really has to be one or the other. If you're gonna put it between ChatGPT and God to decide who gets banned and who doesn't, let people have alt accounts. If you have a real human being (not JH) behind the desk actually doing their job and reviewing the validity of reports before handing out permas, then cool ban their alts too that's fair. Also stop treating mass reports from stacks as multiple reports. It's ridiculous.

 It sucks bc I truly do love overwatch as a game and simply spiting blizzard as a company isn't really enough reason for me to quit forever.",1

 I am curious if open que could work seeing it work so well for marvel rivals and I don't personally recall anyone hating it pre-Brigitte, not to mention we have the anti-heal passive to keep goats in check and with perks we could have some counter shields incase shield stacking becomes a problem again. Although I assume we as players have finally learned to take off angles and just ignore some of where the shield stacks happen.",1
XOjE_MjUW54,@LuckyNobody1,2025-02-26T00:27:12Z,"So us Doom mains have been asking for a parry feature to the block for a while and in a sense we got it but in such a weird way. 

It does prevent most CC but it also takes 20 less damage to get full charge (which is OP and due to normal block needing 100 damage at -20% damage reduction whereas power matrix just needs the 80 dmg) and you take no damage for that first second too (also OP) so it can be really strong against some comps. 

But Doom's most unfair counter still counters him... 

They could have gave doom 0.75 second of Orisa fortify, I think that would have worked a little better.",1

1. Get blamed for throwing if you don't kill 3 people within 0.0000004 seconds of a team fight starting. Or get called a hacker if you kill more than 2 people in a fight.

3. If the enemy doesn't counter you, enjoy your 1 kill before everyone counters you.

The matchmaking is STILL complete trash, still creates nothing but stomp games, and every game has at least one but usually a few obvious high level players on a smurf account to ruin matches for average players. Laughably they claimed in their stupid developer video to have worked on mAtChMaKInG, and as usual it's clearly a lie.  They just DON'T CARE.
The lootboxes will never give you anything new that's currently out, and all you get is sprays and souvenirs all the time.  The battlepass still sucks, and the store is still overpriced, except a couple bundles of really old skins they made now that they don't care about.  
Nothing has changed, they're just gaslighting and lying, like they always do.  They are just desperately trying to get players back from Rivals, which you can actually have fair games in and have fun.  I wish Overwatch 1 was still here.  And I wish these devs were gone.",1

And i can't lie Marvel Rivals is gonna be a big problem for overwatch specifically since they have endless heros to put in the game and ow has to think all from scratch. Marvel has been around for ever i think Marvel rivals is gonna take number 1 for this style of game play and rightly so when your calling overwatch overwatch 2 when it doesnt even feel like it at all you guys treated your fan base bad for to long all i can say is to little to late.,1

Looking around through everything in Season 15, messing with the new abilities, it was a cool and nostalgic experience. But you guys will never be more than what you've done. I sat in the shop, staring at the $40 battle pass package, contemplating whether I'd get back into the game. That is a decision that I wouldn't even have hesitated on back in 2022. But you guys lost my trust, and that is something you simply cannot buy back with shiny new features that were promised years ago. I hope you guys wear your 22% rating on Steam like a badge of honor, because you will never be more than your mistakes after what you've done to your consumers.

Not to mention that all of the perks are f*cking idiotically unbalanced and non the less they decided to again, 10)% airdrop them, taking away the game I used to give my brain a breather & recharge. Its stupid, irrational, ruins the game for many players, way too random and sudden, ruins the balance they spent years creating completely tossing it over and above all incredibly disrespectful for all the players who stayed loyal all this time still playing and enjoying the game just as it was, if not just like me having it as a way to recharge my mental/social batteries and generic energy level. 

Thanks Overwatch for making a stupid, irrational, disrespectful, horrible and f*cking pathetic change that turned Ovw2 into Ovw 1.5, last time I checked, halfway points never worked out anyways.

Hope yall realize the sh*t you are making certain people go thru just by making it so much more complicated and not even considering keeping a sort of gamemode where you can just play the game as it used to be. Since trial periods were apperantly overrated anyways.

FIRE RATE CAP: in old COD4 Modern Warefare from the older times of cod, your barret semi auto sniper was only able to fire at like 600 rpm but when u put on RAPID FIRE, it not only increases fire rate of full autos, it also raised the fire rate cap of semi autos to over 1000 so u could go crazy. The Strike pack made it so semi auto shotguns and pistols in rainbow six seige were full auto and you could adjust your pull down when holding the trigger for every firearm u had. U had to input down or up to adjust how agressive the pull down was so he would be afk just randomly shooting before he actually started moving around to get the recoil perfect. He stopped cus he realized he was a bitch while cheating and also calls cheaters bitches now. Its amazing how we can grow from crap into a beautiful magic mushroom.",0

I will say tho, I'm sry for the way Aspen and Frogger treat u sometimes. Like, I watch both their videos and love their work, but. Idk. Sometimes I feel like you don't deserve some of their comments even if its supposed to be jokes (that might be my own baggage with ppl in my life before doing similar things tho‚Äîcause jokes arent always jokes & its complicated‚Äî so sry if u dont actually mind and im just. Projecting. I just want u to know someone cares and sees it if that's the case... even if I dont know u well. I wish u the best. Also!!!! Damn!! Been learning ashe the past week and so much more respect than when i started watching ur videos cause seeing u play ashe just... rahhh those shots are fire!! And ur gameplay sense!! Ngl as a mostly support (& tank) player it pains me not see ur supports heal u half the time. Tho tbh sometimes u do los them but still!!! Even when ur in line of sight! My gosh.

Genji > Yoru 
This is obvious might be a lil bias cuz I‚Äôm a genji main but he has more character in his voice

Reaper < Omen 
I don‚Äôt like reaper much tbh yea it‚Äôs iconic but it just sounded sooo boring Omen‚Äôs voice line is good especially in game since there‚Äôs always a sound effect with Val‚Äôs ult voice lines

Mercy < Sage
This is completely bias I just find the yelling better

Sombra > Raze 
That shit still gives me nightmares
