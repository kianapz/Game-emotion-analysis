Rather than looking at a constantly updating game, you look at the series as a whole. Funny enough, I think Pokemon had the opposite problem. They, too, had no competitor, but every generation they try to ""reinvent"" themselves with new game systems and mechanics. Frankly, half of the new stuff Pokemon comes up with never lands with the community at all, so I think it's a very bad case of overcorrection in Nintendo's case.",2025-02-17T18:45:55Z,0
eAAU6eVOm6Y,@plushlava,"I think it's sad that they don't get any recognition for any of the good that their new team and Aaron Keller does. The game has had a steady release schedule for characters and new maps as well as regular, quick, balance updates for the past few years. It seems like the focus is on the blunder that was OW2 debacle, which wasn't the fault of the OW team as a whole, but the fault of Blizzard and, to some extent, Jeff Kaplan not wanting to accept a larger team to work on the game.

Plus, a lot of stuff they're introducing is stuff that took years to develop. Not just reverting stuff. So it's really minimizing the hard work they've put in and the amount of time it took (years) to do it.

It does a great job on casual fun playing with friends. But it lacks in competitive. It feels too easy to rank up. While OverWatch does a better job at that department the competitive side. For anybody that says marvel rivals is more fast-paced than OverWatch your brain is really slow you have a third person view to view everything in front of you.

A huge factor is that my trust for blizzard is completely eroded. I think these changes came from a financial perspective and while they are good changes, they display that blizzard is still playing it safe in a way. 

Like yes overwatch is changing, but its changing because someone showed blizzard that there's a better way to make these kinda games.

Like... they needed to do this when they added the 2 in the title. Not after a better game came out decades later. The die hards will remain and overwatch might pick up a few new players but i doubt that overwatch will capture that entire mainstream audience again. I dont agree that Overwatch has a fighting chance, I think its a tired old boxer that needs to retire. Im talking Cars 3 the movie.

Not only that, but im not interested in moba/counter strike inspired features like buying builds or perk trees. I dont think perks are the answer, i think their balancing philosophy was the problem. 

Rivals allows everything to feel strong, and gives you strong counterplay options and strong swap options.

I just hate these systems in general because it takes my brain out of the actual gameplay often. I want to focus on perfecting my hero kit, i dont want to focus on a meta perk build for my hero.",2025-02-18T00:05:00Z,0

yotb8B3IjiA,@Devlyn444,"I play the game, I genuinely like the game but I 100% agree somethings need to happen, here are my big 5 things:

1) Scrap the ""new"" content. Like you said, just revealing ""Overwatch"" and dropping the ""2"" would be a massive bonus, on top of reverting back to a 6v6 format. (I do not think Blizzard needs to scrap any hero, except Sombra, if anything)

2) Hero rework. Adapting the heroes so they can fit a 6v6 format, tanks will be hit the hardest.

3) Release more content; heroes, villains, maps, modes, this game needs way more.

4) Scrap FOMO. 
MR: ""Do what Marvel Rivals is doing with their Battle Pass system. Oh, you bought it but didn't complete it? That's fine, it's in an archive, you can revisit and unlock things at your own pace.""
OW2: ""Oh? You bought a Battle Pass but you don't have 20+hrs a week to devote to our game? Welp, better luck next season, lmao.""

5) Balancing the fucking roster. Hamster, Hanzo, Sombra, Venture, all of these heroes are so busted that just seeing one is enough to fling a team into a rage. 

5a) Hamster is impossible to kill. I had to coordinate a Junkrat, Pharah, Reinhardt, and a Moira, just so people could kill it.

5b) Hanzo has such a forgiving headshot radius he can shoot score a headshot from a lower level, aiming below your waist, 5 ft to the right of your hip while also doing a double jump right, it's utterly ridiculous. 

5c)Venture is like Mei, able to completely ignore all of your shots by pressing a button, though Venture doesn't heal they do become the most spergy, annoying heroes in the game. 

5d) Lastly, Sombra. I hate invisibility, I hate her ability to teleport out of danger the moment she gets caught, I hate that after teleporting it automatically triggers invisibility, I hate that invisibility lasts 5 seconds and the teleport has a 6 second cooldown, I hate that her Hack ability denies you your cooldowns for 1.5 seconds (or steals a healthpack on the map), I hate that the Hack exposes you to her whole team through walls for 10 seconds, I hate that her Virus ability does something like 80 damage over 4 seconds, I doubly hate that her Virus attack does 120 damage over 2 seconds if you're Hacked, I hate that her Virus has a recharge time of 6 seconds... but most of all, I hate that she can Hack you and then Virus you for 120dmg, mag dump you with her highly accurate, high damage, 60 shot, long range SMG, toss her her teleport to go invisible (all while you're turning around I might add), decloak, toss ANOTHER Virus for 120dmg, then teleport away AGAIN all before your first ""Hacked"" status is even over. OH! And she can see you through walls when you're low health, AGAIN, so you can literally never get away.",2025-02-01T03:06:35Z,0

Overwatch is built on much more polished infrastructure, where as Marval Rivals seems to take the cheaper route in a lot of areas. Whether it be voice acting, some of the animations / particle effects and sub-par coding, balancing, etc.

I don't play either game at this time, and I may be partial as I've played thousands of hours of Overwatch in the past, but I still find it to be a much higher quality game, and most importantly, highly original (but not entirely) in its concept.

Blizzard did poorly manage Overwatch, and that might be an understatement. Overwatch 2 was basically a greedy shop re-work, hardly a sequel. We are yet to see how Marvel Rivals will be managed, and if it will stand the test of time. They do have the benefit of seeing the decisions Blizzard made with Overwatch, what worked and what didn't.",2025-01-20T05:00:50Z,0

When you watch back replays you see things you dont normally see in the game but devs still added those little details, for example even when junkrat concussion mine hits an enemy, they make proper facial expression and their body like bends a little when they launch into air. Even though destruction in Overwatch is more limited, it still looks a lot better than in Rivals, parts of broken elements stay for longer, it takes more force to break them and they brake more naturally. All that in a game that launched almost 9 years ago. That said, what matters the most is the gameplay and i think overall hero design in MR is a lot better and game offers more characters with unique playstyles, a lot of heroes in Ow were reworked and their unique playstyle got taken away too, like doom, pharah or sombra.

qZVVVT5S_uQ,@TheQuietTimes,"My only issue with Rivals is the excessive alpha effects. Many times, there is so much visual clutter that it can be near-impossible to tell what's going on, ESPECIALLY if you're playing strategist and are on the back-lines. 

I think particle effects muddying the visibility goes against the entire idea of the flat colors of environments contrasting with the bright colors of heroes and their distinct silhouettes, as team fights tend to turn into ""just shoot at the red"" (the default enemy outline color) rather than being able to distinguish and focus on a particular target, especially with all the characters bunched up...

I stopped playing after they chose to scam their players with promise of PvE content on OW2 and then proceeded to scrap that and change OW to a 5v5 ( really messed up the core gameplay imo, since characters were designed to be play in a 6v6 format from the beginning). Not to mention, Papa Jeff left Overwatch as well, which was the final nail in the coffin for me. So i haven't played( other than custom games) since OW ended. it was really disappointing what they did to this IP. I was so excited to see the world develop and built; i found the characters to be quite interesting, so much so i had pre-ordered Overwatch when it was first launched. Then OW2 happened üòûüòû

Seeing this tho, which i'm glad i did,  makes me optimistic about at least the PvP of the game since it has one of my favorite character/hero to play in games: Widowmaker. i'd hop in time to time just to play widow HS lobbies but if what he's saying in this video is accurate, then i'll have to give the core game a try again.

After literally getting to try the original 6v6 patch of Overwatch, the game has come a long way. As much as I love Overwatch 1, that dev team really wasn't good at balancing, especially compared to the Overwatch 2 team. They've had some misses, but at least they keep reassuring the community that their game is important and that they will work towards creating an experience that satisfies people. The player numbers don‚Äôt lie. I'm impressed that Overwatch isn‚Äôt like Apex right now, which is super dead. I feel like after the Marvel Rivals hype dies down, people will understand and maybe give more appreciation towards the balance in Overwatch 2. I guess I'm just optimistic, but after all the constant low-hanging fruit bashing on Overwatch, it‚Äôs refreshing to remember that it‚Äôs not all bad.",2024-11-23T23:34:34Z,0

After so many years, i logged on today, seeing that the lore has grinded to a halt, and seeing the characters i love become MHA characters and weird non character specific skins themed around the battle pass....

I think both are great ideas is executed well. Hero bans, i really hope they have a safe protection for people always banning X hero due to being OP and this is across multiple games and player base. As this would get annoying and alienate players, and definitely drive people away. Im all for variety and trying different heroes as I do play different heroes myself. The bigger issue would be people overdoing banning the same heroes across multiple games, etc. 

As for the map voting, one reason why I only play more casual especially only playing in QP, is purely because I do see the same maps more chance then none. I barely see runasapi, played it about 3 times.  Hopefully on the flip to my comments on hero bans, they see this as an issue and address this.

There's no need to start managing and working on a well-established game that shook ground on release that a CEO abused and trash on it even mildly. You can simply say that the game dev process has been like this but they need a new angle to approach it. 

OW1, old Overwatch was all about risky decisions to make a better game. Characters like Moira and Brig were wild and a lot of people didn't like them at first. Announcing a campaign mode for the new Overwatch was risky but they pushed forward with it despite all the corporate pushback and how they mangled the team further to ensure it didn't happen. So not entirely sure how aggressive and risky decisions for the game are a new philosophy when the worst part of Overwatch's history has been the release of OW2 where they quickly decided to play it safe until competition started beating the shit out of them.",2025-02-15T16:25:42Z,0

Secondly, whenever I play overwatch it feels like I'm entering a store with the actual game being a hidden feature. The only popups you get are about the new crossover skins or the deals that they so generously provide. While Rivals feels more like a an actual fun game. They feel like they have passion and pride in their work showing off all the new modes, maps and characters they've worked on.",2025-01-28T06:11:07Z,4

BUT I KEPT PLAYING and I understood the love and amazing play styles that can be found while playing. I wished overwatch devs would TAKE ANYTHING you said into account. You explain my frustration to a T. You make me not feel crazy for wishing mercy was a little over tuned after being seen as a bad supp for like 8 seasons now. She is sadly very weak I feel like and I'm not sure why no one besides mercy players think that. Why are we not listening mercy mains when it comes to her kits and how she should feel when played. Thank you for sticking up for mercy and being a reminder that she still should be tuned and not left alone.",2025-02-18T16:10:30Z,0

u1XkpplU_WU,@richardwitt6243,"___ New Mercy Perk Ideas ___
.
Minor Perk 1:  ""Friend or Foe""
Mercy can target enemy heroes with guardian angel.
> Gives some more opportunity to outplay the enemy
.
Minor Perk 2: ""Improved Aerodynamics""
Angelic Descent doesnt slow you down anymore.
> This used to be the case during Mercy's first movement rework if i remember correct.
> Enables her to keep more momentum (speed) from GA or enemy boops while gliding.

Major Perk 3: ""Highvelocity Impact""
When Mercy's speed is above 10 m/s (horizontal or vertical), her quick melee does increased damage (maybe 75 dmg) and creates a small presure wave that pushes mercy and the target that was hit apart.
> This synergizes with either Perk 1 or Perk 2
> Can be used aggressively or defensively. 
> Gives her the opportunity to deal a bit of damage quickely to maybe fight away a Tracer or Genji.
> Rewards good movement.",2025-02-18T15:46:07Z,7

It should be the case that picking up a perk makes you rethink your muscle memory around GA, or your function in team fights with chained boosts or heals. If perks only reinforced things your character was already designed to do then the entire concept would be an exercise in futility and they should just buff the character generically.",2025-02-18T15:17:10Z,2

I know overwatch 2 is just about mercylesly wringing out as much money as possible but atleast put in some effort.

Say you REALLY like Genji and only play Genji, what will you do if the opposite team comp is Winston, Symmetra, Mei, Moira, and Brig? You can reflect a couple of things from Mei, one thing from Moira, and ZERO things from Winnie, Sym, and Brig, not to mention your only defense will now be dashing away and you'll just have to play poke until you get blade and even then with that many beams focusing you you'd die even with 2 pocket healers.",2024-10-15T20:35:11Z,0
u2mMbSKf6iE,@zweiigorgon8980,Played this game for like a week i can already tell why people are lvl 700 stuck in gold. I hit plat and these players play with no agency. Supports double stack on tanks DPS are afraid to make plays and just shoot tanks all games and tanks are afraid to go in to disrupt comps. If i can hit plat under 50 hours and you guys are seasonal silvers and golds playing for years then this games rank economy is doomed.,2024-10-15T18:38:44Z,0

Theres certain times you want to play certain things and if you dont have the right equipment or creatures for the job your basically screwed, thats player selection and counter selecting. If you use yohr ult at the qrong time because your team isnt there, thats like attacking with a powerful card but not having anywhere for it to go, the damage just cancels out and they overpower you in the end. You can make a ton of comparisons between the 2 games. If you do things right and fight your battles correctly, itll work.

Like bro, i won a few games in gold/plat, im not a smurf & they need to stop expecting me to carry games, when statistacially, that sets you up for failure unless your gods gift from Top 500.

S_Sw393dP18,@bguzman8581,"Overwatch devs. I mean this in a good way: stop responding to anything Marvel Rivals-related or thinking about them at all. So far some responses to Rivals' critique make you sound like a sports coach who gets heated up with no control over his emotions whenever there's good competition. Just relax, focus on what you're doing, give your community what it wants(or what you promised them), and don't rush things. The most important thing is to calm down bc there's always going to be hype around different games like for example there was a lot of hype for Helldivers, Space Marine, and Wukong, rn is Marvel rival's turn it doesn't mean that you won't get yours again. 

Keep up the good work ;)

Overwatch may have been a marketable PvP model, but Overwatch 2 was going to be the story of hope and making a difference these people had been dying to tell.

In This case I think marvel rivals is showing them physical proof that some of the major feature requests they have been given, really work well!

She would have to have participated in overwatch between 26(the end of the first omnic crisis) and 6(the disbanding of overwatch) years ago. The ""golden age"" of overwatch, and I think this is more likely to be when she participated, since she was positively renowned and worked in search and rescue, was 20 years ago.

zIx8gwXFlsc,@LightingCatxD,"The replay situation leaves me truly scratching my head. Usually the replay system only shows you what the server receives on input, basically the servers pov and not individual players POV‚Äôs at all! Thats why for example if you watch a replay of anyone that is lagging or got switchlagged in a server looks pretty normal besides their inputs themselves lagging around and looking like they got a schizophrenia attack, but no lags themselves will be recorded from the users end-device pov and registered only the received inputs by each player. Not what the user end-device receives. Idk if the same counts for killcams aswell because I noticed while u don‚Äôt see anything the User might see on their enddevice (e.g lags or rubberbands) in their representative killcam, that sometimes killcams look abit different to what the pov would look like in the replay pov. I had some games where a killcam threw me off and when i went into the replay it looked way smoother so welp. This entire thing leaves me quiet with a headscratch bcs this entire video just flipped all the logic and laws that we know of how the servers and replays work over its head. I hope someone deepdives into this thematic and analyses it to its core of how this is possible because I honestly got no explanation for it.",2025-01-14T13:43:23Z,1

It feels like game devs have gotten lazy and simply refuse to use stats as a way to ID cheaters.

Wait... is that a backtracking cheat? I'm only used to seeing backtracking in Valve games (Team Fortress 2 / Counter Strike), and I've never actually seen it from the cheater's perspective. Backtracking is a cheat that allows the user to see and interact with other players as though they were ""in the past"" by manipulating server latency (which also means that you're unlikely to see it go back more than 1 second into the ""past"").

It's really interesting how the replay viewer picks it up, but only when you're using the cheater's perspective. It's also really funny how, due to how fast he's going, it looks like he's teleporting long distances.",2025-01-11T12:39:55Z,0

THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT CHARACTER, IT WAS A DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ADDITION.

They wanted brownie points from the alphabet brigade and activists so they made venture ""N-B"". Now that they actually have the character, they can't make many creative skins because if they lean any direction feminine or masculine, it'll ""defeat the purpose"" of the NB aspect.

They did that to themselves, no pun intended, now they will have to enjoy the recolor skins or a skin with a mask and coat covering all body aspects that may imply a specific gender lmao. 

That, and also because the most popular and played heroes are also the most attractive. Aint nobody want an ugly skin on an ugly character. Venture is basically a Concord reject.",2025-02-17T00:04:03Z,0

GqZBekBmG-g,@lj1653,"kitsune kiriko: I feel like we already have this  
lucky cat ashe and bob: not feeling it  
yuki onna widowmaker: strong design, nice shoes. SHIP IT. 
bear roadhog: creative but I would like to see this pushed further into a panda  
magepunk juno: this is all over the place, too busy. scrap it! 
magepunk hanzo: good asymmetry but not recognizable as hanzo. give him a chin beard and rework the belt buckle into two dragons fighting each other, and add a dragon motif to his right robotic hand, like it's a dragon hand.  
magepunk kiriko: I like the detail on the leggings. I'm not sure what the side nets are supposed to be. this needs more revisions. 
magepunk reinhardt: make the arms a bit shorter and the fists a bit bigger. when he charges can he release steam behind him? I'd like to see a purple version too. 
ninja sombra: remove the socks, can we change the color scheme to black and white? 
ninja cassidy: remove the socks, ship it  
ninja ashe & bob: remove the socks, show me a version that pushes ashe more in the direction of dragonball z  
ninja roadhog: remove the socks. can we take this into a more 'shredder' direction? 
ninja kiriko: wonderful hair and outfit. SHIP IT. 
fantasy airship kiriko: absolutely no  
star dancer juno: this is great. ship it. also can we get an 80's hot pink and black version and give her more 80's hair? 
dressup doll kiriko: not really feeling this one. can you do some other versions where it's a halloween skin and she has pale gray or green zombie skin with stitches? like a scary doll that has come alive? 
solar juno: can we go in a more 'protoss' direction with this? I'm thinking of blue transparent glass material for the metal

I still remember when all the blizzard shills were spreading the talking point about how pay to win and predatory marvel rivals monetization would be. meanwhile the only reason they thought that is BECAUSE THATS WHAT OVERWATCH 2 DID, THE GAME THEY MAKE A LIVING DEFENDING. this is seriously one of the most pathetic sequels of all time this game deserves to die just based on principle. they spent years ignoring their community suggestions instead putting all the budget into funding shills to gaslight their players, sorry but after fifteen seasons of lies we know better than to trust this company and its unabashed shills.

ffs Junker queen has perfect skin and no scars. half of her character is that she wants nothing more than a scrap. a character I utterly refuse to believe is not on a first name basis with the entire junkertown ER staff rotation, has no visual indicator that she's ever been hurt.

don't get me wrong. characters are allowed to be attractive, but there are types of attractive that can be explored.

also doomfist having no scarring is utterly inexcusable. genuinely I cannot even begin to justify that from a design standpoint.

beyond scarring you have birthmarks, discoloration, or something like vitiligo. so many ways you can break up this tiresome trend of plastic figures that've never left their display case.

I genuinely adore venture, not only because they have a delightful personality, but because their design looks like they lived a life before. they're awkward, they've got a chipped front tooth, their clothing makes me believe that they actually might work with heavy equipment.",2025-02-18T12:51:17Z,0

Freja, widow and Ashe all suffer from same face syndrome and her outfit just looks very samey when compared to other heroes like ana, sojourn and a few others.

OW2 has definitely been declining in terms of art direction especially when you look at those hideous fucking mythic skins, they're prime examples of ""overdesigned"".

Acting like you are ""turned off from 6v6"" but you literally rage quit 5v5 overwatch to go shill for a 6v6 game, yeah whatever you say Mr. Nda you have a great track record of being trustworthy simping for this game before during and after they pull one of the biggest rug pulls in recent years. you are just mad cause people are calling you out for the hypocrisy.

Anyways, I'm glad to see you enjoying 6v6 in marvel rivals, no matter how much you refuse to admit its the superior format because people who enjoy 6v6 are mean to you because you gaslight them in your unrelenting shilling for blizzard. You can say whatever you want but your actions speak louder than words. Feel free to stop playing rivals if 6v6 is really that awful and we are all so toxic. Why are you even playing rivals by your logic isnt that game just filled with toxic 6v6ers like samito? Just go play 5v5 overwatch if its so good and 5v5ers are so non-toxic, we literally dont give a fuck, but you wouldn't be getting the same viewership cause its a dead format nobody cares about. Seriously if our behaviour is such a turn off for you and thats why you dont like 6v6, then stay playing 5v5 on overwatch, all us 6v6ers stopped playing that shit a long time ago, you will never have to deal with us just keep playing 5v5 and we won't be watching, but why are you specifically playing a 6v6 game which majority of us 6v6ers migrated to if we are so toxic and our behaviour is such a turn off for your enjoyment of the format? you have a perfect 5v5 game right there with no 6v6ers because we all stopped playing that dog shit, but you rage quit it to go hang out with 6v6 refugees on marvel rivals, who you find toxic and insufferable? make it make sense.",2024-12-30T16:53:17Z,1

With Juno in our Team
We can overcome any scheme

Each round you are going to be facing a slightly different Rein, So you need to relearn all the abilities that might or might not be coming towards you, have they picked perk A or perk B, what about the 2nd perk, or third? So there are multiple things that need to be worked out as to what you are facing. Each character will have multiple different things that need to be worked out again.

Because Microsoft is right behind them, waiting to push the team over a cliff to replace them. Which is why 5v5 has stayed as long as it has. Too much time and money has went into the rebranding, and if they are going to drop the ""2"", for a new Paladins game mode. Phil Spencer would then replace the team without a second thought. Since at this point, it wouldn't matter what devs they have. It would then confirm that the direction of the Overwatch team is in disarray. Which then tells Phil, why don't I just plug in Microsoft employees instead. Plus shareholders would probably start losing their minds.

Also Perks is the most useless feature. What is the point when it is just a teaser of Stadium? You want to make a M.O.B.A, cool you have the mode. But why put this useless feature in the main game.

What are the correct starts that will make your plays better. Also another issue I've had since OW1 and is still an issue as of the current state of the game. Is that while yes there are bot matches that are capture and payload. But there isn't a bot match with flashpoint and clash. That is why bronze and silver players are bad at both modes cuz there aren't opportunities to learn the modes, learn the map layout, what corners are good to catch enemy players off guard, team strats that parties can come together and gather a plan that is beneficial for players in the party needs. New players are being dogged and bashed for not being good at the game, but again there is no opportunity to learn and grow so they are stuck with either two options 

 A. look up a YouTuber who streams and makes overwatch content or look up video guides on how to play their role/character 
And 
B. Learn by getting your ass kicked like a millennial in a halo and cod mw2 360 lobby. 
You could ""pay"" for coaching to learn how to play the game but who actually has the money and reason to pay for someone else to tell you why you are bad and how you continue to be bad? 
I am all for game studios to pay for professional players to make content and sponsor the game. And I'm all for professional coaching to teach you how to play professionally. 
However there comes a point where it is the game developers responsibility to make sure there is in game content for new players to learn and grow. By again offline practice modes that teach you how to play roles, learn your character with reference scenarios to how a player is meant to be played and the core fundamentals on how the character operates.

If the overwatch team actually invested some time and effort into the writing and animation of similar content as the cinematic shorts, it would be a huge step into bringing Overwatch back into the eye of the general public. Maybe something like a mini-series of 20 minute episodic stories fleshing out the lore, or just developing new events in the plot (but they have to have the same quality as the cinematic shorts, otherwise people will just turn away after the first 5 minutes). They already had a campaign planned out for the PvE, so there's already a structure to start off from.

If they do it right, this could do what Cyberpunk: Edgerunners did for Cyberpunk 2077 or what The Witcher season 1 did for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

It wont change the game overnight but it'll definitely feel better than 5v5.

Also saying they're giving marvel rivals a year of a head start is hilarious because OW2 had a long time to 1, test out 6v6 and learn that its actually more enjoyable, and 2, to implement it into the game. They've had more than enough time but they denied 6v6, called it nostalgia, and tried to push forward with 5v5. Wasnt until few months before rivals came out where they finally gave in to talk about 6v6 and took until AFTER rivals came out for the test to be playable.

oOQRDATkejc,@rinslergj1,"As someone who is on the side of 5v5 I'll 100% quit if the game switches to 6v6 if I don't quit before then. I do not believe the devs would be able to handle balance in the slightest. I think it would be a year or 2 before all 3 roles feel even remotely bearable to play. Secondly I don't want to play against mauga and orisa or doom and ball. The tank synergy felt great in ow1 cause the characters were made for that. To many changes have happened that tanks will run dominate in 6v6 while dps will become completely unplayable and supps will be playing dead by daylight again. Dps has already lost any identity they had as a role with 80% of the support roster having higher damage outputs along with survivability and dps has some of the least maneuverable characters. 

Blizzard before worrying about 6v6 or 5v5 and any other balance numbers tweaking seriously need to sit down and find the identity they want for each role. Do they want tanks being hyper aggressive bouncing in and out of the enemy backline like doom ball and hazard or do they want tanks providing more of a frontline presence for their and denying key terrain like Winston rein sigma. Give dps some kind of identity not just server adim or punching bags. And have supports be support not a jack of trades that out dps the dps and can frontline longer than half the tanks. 

I personally think characters like doom and ball need to be changed to dps roles. No one enjoys playing with or against them. They are designed to be played solo which is horrible for a tank role. Dps needs to gain an identity of highly maneuverable mechanical skill characters. And support need to lose They're identity of heal or dps being They're only utilities. We need more characters like Lucio who's support identity comes from his speed boost and providing a beneficial utility to his whole team. It's why Juno was so beloved upon release she gave utility to her team and was more than just another i heal or dps like moira bap and illari. Lastly all immortality abilities need to be removed venture mei kiri bap makes it so you feel cheated out of kills and not bested.

Dps massively needs a rework across all heroes and the role in general. Ults are complete garbage and barely feel like you can get a kill with them half the time. Excluding emp, rip tire, or the occasional reaper/genji/ashe ult when do you really care if a dps uses their ult. Name the last time you a panic reaction to a Bastion torb cass soldier hanzo ult the same way you do to an illari ult back on release or a kitsune rush/brig/sigma/jq ult. Ults need to be something that changes the dynamic of the game for a brief time not just oh guess hanzo used dragons let me step 2 feet backwards or oh cass used his ult to reload",2025-01-31T09:49:26Z,0

It's not a shot at the streamers themselves, it's just the conclusion that many of the debates and ideas just missed the bigger picture. 7v7 is not a problem because of visual clutter. You could solve or at least mitigate that problem in various ways. the real question are: how is balance in 7v7 role queue? more fun than unfun (on every role)? Role popularity? Are tanks going to be fun? or are they going to get bullied by 5 other enemy players, their abilities and counterpicks? Tanks are and will ever stay the least popular role.

- a sort of scrim finder with is between looking for group and custom games

I would also like to see 7v7:
- DPS always said they didn't put enough pressure because of all ""countering"" ults tanks and healer have. If you add one more dps, you have ""less"" resources per DPS and there is not any more tank to peel even more so if they want to look for a kill on support it's more easily
- Queuetimes would be solved
BUT:
- even if I agree with you I tend to leave this to a ""con"" against 7v7: visual clutter
- audio clutter in voice chat at higher elo will be even worse

I know that Spotlight is gonna show hero bans and I don't really like it but that's fine. They mention 6v6 but it won't be the main game mode for at least 3 seasons because of their longterm vision.
If 6v6 comesback some questions will remain:
- will doomfist get a full revert to go to DPS ? A partial revert with mixed old and new kit in tank ? etc
- a experimental card put Mei on tank before and it was kinda great because her wall was harder to break but didn't put that pression of 2 tanks peeling for her which was annoying back then. Imagine now a double wall with Hazard but with a tank peeling mei...

oOQRDATkejc,@VanSanProductions,"The comparison to Rivals isn't fair because Rivals is not balance and they aren't trying. They will leave shit broken and let the community figure it out. Team-ups introduce more brokenness, and they change with season 2. They will keep the game fun by just making the game wild.

And it all works because of hero bans.",2025-01-30T13:36:48Z,1
oOQRDATkejc,@VanSanProductions,"It's a nice video but 6v6 is going to be the same. 2-2-2 is going to suffer the same problem even without long queue times.

I think the game is extremely balanced and I'm not incorrect.. proof is that they can adjust numbers by tiny fractions and all of a sudden a different meta comes up. This couldn't happen if the game was wildly out of balance.",2025-01-30T13:33:38Z,0

Last night i played top vayne. 1 game was witts end for magic resist and attack speed. Game 2 was triforce making me tanky and a good duelist. Game 3 was using arrows making me a squishy killer. Vayne is a bot lane character. I had to change my itemization and each felt different

These items have all been changed or introduced each season. Not to mention having to itemize over an opposite teams items. Then there are objective

When i come back to dogass league, i know i can play different build, learn what new objectives are and try different positions all on 1 character. Overwatch has never has anything like this but its a different game which is why i cant agree there",2025-02-17T01:27:47Z,0

d0Az539QsYE,@Fantas_YT,"Ngl its a shame the game is dying man. In my childhood around 10-12 yo (now 17yo) i got the chance to play the game at my uncs house and fell in love with it, even tho years later i havent been able to play it cuz paid game i was exited when ow2 came out for free. It was kinda different from what it used to be but still fun but as time passed i just got tired of the same things, tilting every game and stuff.
I did quit like a year ago but still loved the game.
The biggest difference ow1 players will notice is not even the 5v5 mode or the new heroes, it is the difference of what the game wants, it used to be a game that provided fun to people rather than just a game to just earn money lose its value and leave it there, i do get the fact that they need the money to continue the game but they made us dirty making everything behind a pay wall.
Theres a lot of other ways to be able to make profit from the game and keep the players playing.
Theres a big reason of why League is the most popular game for like a decade their constant updates, new content, lore etc. Ofc its stupid to ask for often updates from a fps game and balancing could be difficult, nonetheless i new content and new lore or even just random animations would bring back a lot of people, overwatch animations are probably the best ive ever seen, even if they are short 1-2 minute videos they really attract people, league Arcane is a big example, not only bringing big profits but also new players to the game.
Now winning games doesnt reward you anything but elo and a title for a season, why not just give some chest for the mvps, even if its just some emotes players would be grateful and keen on continue playing. The chest removal was also a big issue in the game, you can check league now, they removed the chest because of ‚Äòlow‚Äô profit which is dumb making f2p players leave the game and big hate from the community.

I would definetly NOT want one or more new heroes every season. Back in the old days when Ana came out, Wrecking Ball etc. it was very special. They had a great lore behind them (mostly) and were very unique in character and in gameplay. I would want them to go back to this approach and not flood the game with mediocre content just for the sake of bringing content. I don't want it to be like LoL were you have a million mediocre heroes with overlapping skills etc. Take your time in developing cool unique characters that are fun to play.

-give us new content, such as the old PvE content they would add like Archives.

-better balancing, actually listen to your playerbase and higher skill players and less bronze players that are just having a cry.

-more maps, bring back 2CP.

-6v6, no brainer.

-Nerf one shot so you have to be WAY closer to one shot as widow, remove one shot from Hanzo OR make it like hawkeye. Hawkeye is actually balanced unlike Hanzo even though he has one shot POTENTIAL

-(optional not mandatory but would be nice to see) Cash shop is more wallet friendly, the prices have been going up slowly and the skins are becoming more and more low quality, now there are more recolours then there are NEW skins being released. Also stop catering specific heroes like Kiriko. I'm yet to see another good Sojourn skin, Venture has ONE legendary that is mediocre after all these seasons since their release. 

-Lastly, fire Aaron Keller and get a leader who actually gives a shit about the game like Jeff did. I knew from the start of Aaron taking over that he would be no good for the game, I always voiced this and said the game will go downhill. That something new will come and take advantage of the decline of quality of the game and take over OW2.

The most expensive skin I've seen so far is $26us overwatch $80. Blizzard wants you to break your bank for your kids skins and take every penny they can squeeze out of you, this company so far hasn't felt that way. And like helldivers, even though the game is still fresh, they are listening to their consumers not ignoring them and implementing pointless changes and skins and what ever else.
