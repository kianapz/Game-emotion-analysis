They, too, had no competitor, but every generation they try to ""reinvent"" themselves with new game systems and mechanics. Frankly, half of the new stuff Pokemon comes up with never lands with the community at all, so I think it's a very bad case of overcorrection in Nintendo's case.",0

I Tried The NEW Overwatch 2 Hero Freya Early With A Surprise Guest!!!,RJDvpxYW3lg,@GuzanGames,"I like freja as hero, great kit and everything... im more interested in commenting on hero bans and map voting. 

I think both are great ideas is executed well. Hero bans, i really hope they have a safe protection for people always banning X hero due to being OP and this is across multiple games and player base. As this would get annoying and alienate players, and definitely drive people away. Im all for variety and trying different heroes as I do play different heroes myself. The bigger issue would be people overdoing banning the same heroes across multiple games, etc. 

As for the map voting, one reason why I only play more casual especially only playing in QP, is purely because I do see the same maps more chance then none. I barely see runasapi, played it about 3 times.  Hopefully on the flip to my comments on hero bans, they see this as an issue and address this. I literally only play my 3 flex games for the day and thats it, and this is a big reason to why.",0
