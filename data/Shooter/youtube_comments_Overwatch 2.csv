Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-20,"i think this version of 6v6 might be the absolute best middle ground they could've gotten. as much as i enjoy the possibility of a triple tank comp, with mauga being in the game and a few other tanks being the way they are, it'd be pretty toxic to include true open queue 6v6. i think the 2 tank max is absolutely fantastic while leaving everyone open to choose roles. this ensures we still stick to the traditional cap of running two tank comps, but we can pull out a 4 dps 2 supports, or 3 dps 3 supports for a fight, maybe 1 tank 4 dps and 1 support, etc. and still get some interesting plays. i think 6v6 open queue with 2 tank cap is 100 the play, since it ensures any triple tank comps no matter what new heroes get introduced cannot make a comeback and we don't run into the same issue back in goats, where you had to have 3 people in every match playing tank or you'd just get rolled if the enemy team ran goats and you didnt, and obviously not everyone wants to play tank.",After

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-02-24,"in general i find that paladins did the whole thing better, having a few select talentsperks that could change how you play the hero is a lot more fun than just making the hero better. for instance in paladins there is a stealth assassin character called skye, she has a smoke bomb that turns her invisible while inside it to help her escape, but a talent gives it healing and allows all of its effects to be applied to allies as well, so the card system that compliments the talent system takes her from being a sombra like character to an aoe healer, completely flipping her playstyle. i just hate having to level up, it makes steamrolls so much worse. if the enemy team stomps you first fight, now they have ult and perk advantage, if they started with counters then you just lose unless you are much better than them. at least that is my experience after 10 hrs. 2506 no. i do not agree. i find the match fun even if i lose as long as it felt close. if i win by a stomp then i do not find it enjoyable. also, awesome self improvement man.",After

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-13,"that 6v6 comment felt very.. misinformed. the 6v6 test ran right as rivals came out, so a chunk of players who do want 6v6 started playing rivals, resulting in a lower overall player count in overwatch. additionally, i'd expect a large chunk of players who prefer 6v6 play competitively, and see no benefit in a qp 6v6 test. the 6v6 test was also heavily criticised from day 1 because the hero balancing didn't feel like a good way to test the 6v6 format. in the same way when the main game switched to 5v5 and a large chunk of the hero roster did not get modified to better suit single tank playstyles even now, most offtanks play like offtanks. not to even mention midseason 6v6 tests are never going to perform as well as day1season tests. finally, as others have commented, the exact wording was the role queue version accounted for nearly 10 of all play hours in the game for most of its event run. for reference, our role queued quick play mode accounts for roughly 3540 of play hours this was lower during the 6v6 tests. so a good chunk of the 3540 of qp became 6v6 players, even with lower overall player counts and poor balancing. we don't have the exact playtime splits, but the mode was popular enough that they kept it around in the arcade after the test was supposed to end due to its popularity. that's a very, very big indicator.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-12,"i really liked what you said about the speed at which community feedback effects balancing now. i used to be neutral on 5v5 vs 6v6, but having seen firsthand that they really don't know how to balance 5v5, i've become a pretty strong advocate for the return of two tanks. many people i've spoken to about it whine about stuff like goats or generally horrible eras of balancing like double shield as a point against it, and i honestly don't think people give enough credit to just how badly a lack of any balancing effected 6v6. during overwatch 1's lifespand, the dev team seemed very willfully ignorant or accepting of absolutely broken heroes almost as though they couldn't see how they could ever get things wrong see launch brig, but nowadays the dev team for all the shit we give them is actively engaged with the community. while sometimes they'll put out some ass patches, its so important to recognise that dogshit patches usually only stick around for a few weeks max, as opposed to a year and a half as they would have previously. in my eyes, the only real argument against 6v6 that holds up to scrutiny is queue times, but i would argue with two tanks making hard counters less of an issue, and the dev team being more proactive with balancing, its not unlikely that tank could become popular enough to counter the lengthened queue times we'd see from 6 players per team.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-13,"the only moments i want 6v6 is when i'm playing tank because i feel like my mistakes are 75 more effective to the game. however, i just enjoy the game and don't queue for tank unless i'm trying to get in my weekly rewards. i've never been a tank main and i respect those who are, it's stressful. lmfao! i will always love this game and i have fun 90 of the time, i think it's more enjoyable with friends because the teamwork is more efficient but i played alone for 2 years. i do get sad thinking about the lore we miss out on but i do see they are trying, i respect them for doing what they can under such conditions. i really appreciate your videos and i hope the people who constantly put this game down will come across your channel. the heart and soul is still there, we still get small events and new voice lines and animations even if they aren't the quality they once were. i think perks was an incredible addition and they are bringing more characters quite frequently now so things won't get as stale. i also think working on pve when the game switched to freetoplay would have been a bit of a rough thing, a lot of the players came from ovw1 but a lot didn't the newer most active players came after that and i think focusing on a balanced game for everyone to play is better for now. there is still time, anything is possible and development has gotten better with time. patience is a virtue!",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-13,"i recently came back and besides a month or so when ow2 launched, i haven't really played since 2019 or 2020. i aggree that they improved a lot of things and there is a good foundation now. but the most disappointing part to me is just the level of toxicity even in quickplay. after role queue launched, there was almost like this golen age of qp. the games had somewhat good quality and people where very chill for the most part. when i came back, i've spend the first couple of days just getting flamed for not knowing how to play. and that just seems to be the normal experience these days. it feels like people expect you to take qp as serious as comp and if you want to try out new characters, you just have to accept that you're getting flamed for the entire session. i also don't recall running into people throwing qp games in ow1 but in ow2 it happens all the time. it's just very exhausting and after talking to some friends, they also recommended to not just leave vc but also mute text chat. which is very sad, but also very reasonable imo and after 3 months, alongside visibile scoreboards i think the main reason for this toxicity is that blizzard punishes you a lot more for leaving qp games. i don't think players got more toxic but in ow1 if someone got tilted, they just left the game instead of making their anger everyone elses problem. in ow2 you're kinda stuck with every lobby, so people get angry and can't leave. but it's still qp so they also don't have a reason try to win. toxicity and throwing just seems to be the logicial consequence of that.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-07,"i've had a few perk ideas for reaper since all of his perks are either extremely counterproductive to his playstyle or littered with so many drawbacks that the perk becomes niche oh, and soul orbs just plain lazy. we've already seen it a thousand times. here are a few that i thought of  phantom step a perk that replaces his wraith form with a swift lunge. this lunge would be a brief, but faster version of wraith form, allowing reaper to close the gap more effectively, while also adding a layer of skill expression by limiting his invulnerability time. getting a kill would reset his phantom step, preventing him from becoming a sitting duck after going all in for a single kill. this perk is for his flanking playstyle  wrathful frenzy a perk that, again, replaces his wraith form, but this time providing him with 90 damage resistance that number is not final and damage multiplier for the duration of his frenzy. the trade off being that he is no longer intangible. this is for his brawlerfrontline playstyle. smoke grenades reaper's old model had a utility belt with the grenades from his museum cinematic. this perk would give him those smoke grenades as a projectile right click that he can launch to cover an area in smoke. enemies that are caught within the smoke are exposed! in the same way widow's ult marks people. looming shadows reaper gains the ability to send out a shadow clone that spawns in a pillar of smoke as if it was a reaper teleport. after spawning, the clone walks towards the closest enemy. shooting the clone could either apply a debuff stundiscord orb or deflect the damage back at the enemy undecided.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-19,"lw seriously needs different perks all around, give him the option to encase himself in his grip for a duration while healing, expending the cd. or let him close up a petal platform to form a true barrier around whoever is in it and allow him to heal through it. perks should affect a gameplay of a hero massively in a positive way, not be slight differences that doesnt change the game in any shape or form. the fact you think were going to take superbloom and shoot people as lw players is just a joke. its just not feasible 90 of the time. if enemies are actually competent i avoid all contact with them and focus on healing and saving teammates. there is no time for shooting unless theres a landslide of an advantage. mercys angelic restoration is just downright stupid and should be changed. its no different from lifeweavers life cycle, sure they might save you from a tracer or winston barely but like they couldve been something so much better instead of a lose less ability. they should be win more. tie in things to mercy boosting damage. make it reduce cooldowns, allow flash heal to chain to all targets during valkyrie. if double damage beam is strong in the neutral, flash heal should be strong during valkyrie. it only makes sense, double beam is useless during valkyrie. so this makes the perk selection something to think about even more. not to mention the 150 healing is reduced by antihealing of any degree making it extremely underwhelming for a major perk. it should cleanse when an enemy is affected by a hard cc or antinade while forgoing the heal instead, opens up so many more options for mercy. we also seem to have forgotten that flash heal also does not heal mercy for 15 of the health restored when successful. also for the love of god rename it to renew or revitalize. not flash heal. at least keep it in theme with her kit. the funniest part is even if you do all of these  ana and kiriko are still better. a single double swift step perk is better than all eight of mercy and lws perks summed up.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-02-26,"i'm not 100 sure but i think i like the idea of the trade offs if everyone else had trade offs. if the options offers changes on how we play rather than just a buff of playing the same way. orisa losing spin for shield is great to me, i can choose to play more defensively and deal with certain match ups although, the cd could be higher tbf. soldier having to decide between a stimpack or healing is a neat decision making thing in game. choosing to lose heals for power, of course it's a bit clunky to use and a short duration but i like the idea. i think things like this adds an interesting dynamic that players have to keep thinking about as their match progresses and makes their heroes feel a little different. or like the sombra healing is interesting although idk how useful that is. but i feel this only works and feels fair when it's consistent across the hero roster. blizzard should establish some ground rules on what a minor perk and major perk gives and changes. like minor perks should be buffs to the base kit that direct the focus of where the power in the kit is. the major perks can change the game play itself by offering the hero a new tool. i agree, a lot of the perks are redundant or overbuffed with past buffs and the base mechanics. they could start looking at doing away with those advantages. like the torbjorn overload should probably not have the reload anymore, or his perk could remove the reload if it transforms his turret because the focus of the kit should be in the turret, not his gun if the perk chosen is turret focused. and they shouldn't be scared on adding cool downs or taking power away from one aspect when giving power to another area when necessary. again, perks imo should have either strong upsides or offer new abilities in exchange for something, andor if a buff to abilities if they are mediocre or very basic in the early game without perks, that way when you level them up you feel like you're really working towards something that is more useful and interesting and i think makes it easier to balance the power level.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-13,"ow gets a bad rep from it's comically bad rebranding to ow 2. that 2 doesn't even signify anything but the broken promise of pve at this point. the switch from 6v6 to 5v5 also killed the design of many heroes since many relied on having a second tank to get their value. they have still done absolutely nothing to remedy this problem, and have created horrendously bad tanks to play against making the problem exponentially worse since counter swapping mainly only affects tanks, and the rest of your team is always too stupid to understand that maybe they should be the ones to swap instead of flaming you. shooting an orisa, mauga, hazard, roadhog or even ball is the equivalent of shooting a wall for 3 minutes straight. at least with reinhardt his shield can break, making him extremely vulnerable. that kind of tank design is simple, easy to understand, and fun to play against. the 5 aforementioned heroes are not. they have so many means of survival, it's impossible to track all of them and punish them when they mess up. you literally have to use hard cc to stop them in their tracks or they'll just run you over. same can be said for a lot of support heroes like baptist, kiri, and lifeweaver. all they have to do is use their overpowered invincibility ability, and suddenly your ult is useless or the kill you were chasing just gets robbed from you in an instant. that's not fun to play against either. then comes the final debate with sniper heroes. nobody likes getting killed instantly, but at least with a one shot combo, or reinhardt's charge, they're so easy to avoid and hard to set up, you deserve to die if you get caught in one. a sniper doesn't need to worry about any of that. they can pick you off if you even so much as breath in their line of sight for absolutely 0 risk. that kind of game design is absolutely horrendous to play against, especially if that widow can hit her shots. tf2 is a grand example of how awful a sniper is in any game because of its bot crisis a while back. even now that it's over, good sniper players are still horrendous to fight against since unless you have a battalion soldier or vaccinator medic on your team, it's impossible to play the game just like how the bots took over servers and made them unplayable.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-13,"i saw a lot of comments point out the incorrect interpretation of the 6v6 playtests, so i'll just throw in my 5 cents contains angry rant, beware personally, i can't wait for the midseason 6v6 comp mode, even if it'll be open q although i'd much prefer 222, i understand the q times issue, so ig thats fair enough. i'm an avid 5v5 hater and from the moment i played 6v6 the first time i haven't played ow1, unfortunately, i always die a bit inside, when i see another immortal tank. i also feel like 5v5 is just bad to play. tank feels abyssmal, for obvious reasons, i pretty muched stopped soloqueuing tankall, damage even tho it has by far the best hero designs in the game feels like garbage sometimes, since you're getting outdamagedoutlived by half the supports not a 5v5 problem, just an issue in general, and shooting the tank isn't viable at all. even when no supports are nearby, pretty much any tank can just roll you over and there's nothing you can do about it. reaper, one of my personal favorite heroes, felt amazing in 6v6, finally being able to reclaim the title of the tankbuster, in 5v5 all he can really do is flank the supports, which by the way, i feel like every dps is pretty much a flanker and there's literally no point in even looking at the tank. i know killing supports was always essential, i think it's fine, but something just felt different in 6v6. it's also eternally frustrating to put all of your ammo, abilities and attacks into a tank with 20 hp and see their healthbar go higher . the only role that doesn't feel terribleuseless a lot of the time, is support. but, hate me for it or not, supports are the worst designed heroes in the game and their gameplay is quite boring. and no, i'm not just a dopamine hungry dps main, i came from paladins 600h there and the supports in paladins were supreme. almost all of them felt at least somewhat skillful and entertaining. a lot of ow supports are just a bit boring, aside from a few like bap, brig they're easy tho or zen  lucio they're basically dps with healing. i'm also not saying i don't like support, but i like it by far the least of all the roles. i'd much rather play dps which i do, but it often feels awful, because of 5v5 or tank which i don't play because it's eternal suffering. so tldr 5v5 still sucks absolute whalesized balls and should be replaced full time by 6v6, it would benefit basically every role and make the game way better, thank you.",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-10-30,"never let this dude cook again. he has something against dps. simple? they tend to be the hardest and most risk taking role in pro play with the most carry potential. i made it to t500 post equalizing on tank easily, it's mostly gamesense and not too much mechanics, unless you play ball  but he's not necessary, supp gm was the easiest time of my life, you're often at a safe distance, they have some of the highest survivability, their ults are almost all save me and others buttons, and they have several forgiving mechanical advantages like ana scoping makes healing shots as big as the moon and she doesn't even need to worry about headshots let's not talk about massive hitbox sleepdart buff since this short is old. dps on the other hand, took a bit, i've got top aim, but the fact is that dps have to take tank level risks while not having tank levels of health, and their survivability is nowhere near supp level of survivability. so they're squishies that have to take high risks with nowhere near as crazy survivability as the safer role that is supp. to balance this, they're made lethal hence dps. this is why dps t500 is the hardest to get into. it's not just the most aim and mechanic intensive role outside maybe wrecking ball for tanks being arguably the hardest hero overall, but you need the top gamesense of tanks as well. don't ever say the role is simple  you dont get away with anything bigger than tiny mistakes as dps, insta evaporated in higher ranks for small mistakes not tiny, unlike the moira fading away or the tank having enough hp  their defensive ability to peel toward the safety of their team and reset. this is why dps on average have the highest deaths ratio in the game check out their stats  especially someone like genji. high risk, high reward, high skill, etc. nothing simple about that. this dude saw a junkrat get away with spamming once and said nah, that's simple, dps is easy. i want to see them play tracer, genji, echo, widow, etc and not be evaporated. otherwise, if we're talking low ranks, all roles are easy, the argument of this role is simple is irrelevant when no one is good enough to do anything against someone who is good, the whole game is simple at that point. dps mechanics and gamesense are so high that i was able to boot a smurf and get gm on illari by just playing her as a dps when she dropped to prove she was op and easy she inevitably got nerfed  doesn't even have noticable visual recoil compared to someone like cass, and now neither does bap!",After
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-03-13,"great video. however as someone who recently got back into the game along with some friends since the s15 changes after playing plenty of s1 but droping for real at s2, and as someone whos been around since very early 2017, i got some inputs i still think 6v6 with adjustments is better than 5v5. the problem never was hero count it was the overall design of heroes and numbers, specially when the most infamous times the game had was due to the devs not knowing whether to catter to the paid sweaty tryhards aka pro players at the owl that they made to try and cash on esports money like its csgo or to stick to their core ideals of making the game a primarly casual but not overly chaotic mess so the competitive side is relevant but not super focused. this was the cause for mercy rework, it was why brig was such a hard counter to dive and movement because dive comp was literally the go since the first year, and then it was why they just figured it better to just get 3 shields and 3 supports and hold m1 specially when they started buffing zarya who was actually in the gutter of viability for a long time before brig came around. 5v5 did bring some breath of fresh air because felt good at first for being a breath of fresh air after 7 years of the old format with it being more dynamic a d singular skill reliant and how it changed tanks position, but after you played for a while, you realized the game becomes way too much like cod to put it broadly. playing support felt awlfull and still mostly feels the worst when before people were complaining it felt bad playing tank because youre the punching bag that receives all the cc did these people even know thats literally your job as a tank in every rpg? youre the one to protect your team from that because you can take it and be less likely to die unlike them! which is why they made tanks feel like theyre raid bosses, which in itself is another problem too, the tank dies the team basically falls apart most of the time unless you got ults, but the tank being alive while 2 others fall can a lot of times still turn it around, but if the 2 are the sups it becomes a lot harder, which puts an even bigger target on their heads than it already was since forever, a lot of people seemingly forgot that since brig because she was notably one that could fight back better. add the dynamic of tanks that are designed around greater offense or mobility and we still have those that feel like they should work as off tanks in 6v6 more than anything. overall i still really hope 6v6 returning as a separate mode isnt just an event, and the reason it had low player count was because it was on a test server iirc which not everyone played but also didnt attract many returning players from old times that would have liked it but didnt held their breaths for it knowing the problems the game already had. but since s15 showed a good chink of improvment plus all the small improvments since the launch that i witnessed returning now, i hope we get an income of returning players now. and finally, about pve, i still think if they couldnt make a full fledged campaign with skill trees and all the initial promises, the first argument would had been that they shouldnt had marketed that while still near the launch when they already knew internnally that wasnt gonna fly, and secondly, the games story is that important for what gave a lot of attention to the game ever since 2014 with the very first cinematic, so they should had at least opted for the thing we had since ow1 pve story missions released if possible at least once a year, but this time let them be available to everyone! while we are at it, archives never returned and apparently its due to them not porting those modes codings to the new engine, but its still doable and should had been on their list of to dos at least on a slower pace but so far nothing on it. ok i yapped a lot, idk if you read it all, but i just want to finish by saying, i am optmistic and excited for this game for the first time in nearly 3 years after so many letdowns and dissapointments for such long time, a feeling i didnt had since the very early s1 but that got shut down quite fast and also one i didnt had since idk 20189. but i think its still too early to get too excited with it knowing the game and company track record, and as much as its half true, its still certantly a considerable influence that marvel rivals caused them to shift their approaches and plans as they now got real competition for the first time because before they were either diferent main genre despite having similarities valorant and apex for example or just didnt kept up with the quality and hype paladins or just outright flopped battleborn and concord. i will try and be optmistic but i also advice everyone to tread carefully, im having fun specially when playing with my friends that are also giving it another chance, but alas, who knows the day of tomorrow.",After
