coiTJbr9m04,@Roudmanlogan,"Just a fun fact:

In the ""Mind the Gap"" mission from ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"" the atmosphere is dark and tense as the heroes maneuver through abandoned warehouses and narrow London Underground tunnels. This scene encapsulates the chilling words of Makarov: ""It doesn’t take the most powerful nation on Earth to create the next global conflict, just the will of a single man.""

In the trailer the camera zooms in on a soldier emerging from the wreckage of a train pursuit 0:55. Dim light filters through shattered headlights and flickering lamps, casting an eerie ambiance. Amidst the darkness of war, this light symbolizes a glimmer of hope, underscoring humanity's resilience.

The soldier, barely recognizable, embodies the anonymity and potent influence of individual will. In the chaos of conflict, anyone possesses the potential to reshape events. Nearby, the train wreckage, once a symbol of unstoppable force, now lies in ruin and disarray, demonstrating how even formidable powers can be halted by one person's unwavering resolve.

Makarov himself, a central figure in the franchise, embodies this notion—a single individual whose decisions can alter the course of global events. His presence in the narrative underscores the profound impact of individual actions amidst the complexities of war.

The combination of Makarov’s chilling quote and the vivid scene invites reflection on the power of individual determination to shape the world, for better or worse.",2024-07-09T13:28:03Z,4

I laughed when Price got stuck in the ""super extra lethal chemical gas and then passed out. It seemed like it was a big deal and then he just woke up on another helicopter and ready to go? 

Let's just say the rest of the campaign after he passes out from the gas is a fever dream and never happened because holy shit the writing and missions are so lackluster!

Диабло с калашами - это круто, бестолковая эклектика,  в корыто закинули всю имеющуюся еду и смешивают в надежде, что каждый найдет там свое. Но только если я выбрал скин с формой разведчика, а рядом со мной бежит супермен, то как-то не понятно, куда я попал? Слышали они про погружение в атмосферу игры?  

Это, конечно, не сумасшествие, все на своих местах, у той ""религии"", которую они транслируют, обнуление через суицидальное смешение понятий - это основная часть программы. Только перед тем, как ""обнулить"", надо сначала очаровать - это тоже основная часть программы. Очарование всегда связано с единым стилем и изящностью. Очень некрасиво, а красота все-таки важна.

IuMeuPJNiHs,@traktornapolye2681,"Господи, когда это уже вымрет. 2023 год. На стопгейме все еще говорят, что голые стволы брать незачем. Прокачка - ЭТО ОСНОВА Call of Duty. Основа, блядь, основ. Как люди в Destiny или Diablo заходят погриндить опыт, выбить новые шмотки - тут тоже самое. Открыть какой-нибудь коллиматор занимает 2-3 матча, если уж так с мушкой трудно бегать. Но и то автор говорит, что даже с прокаченной пушкой его нагибают. И о каком преимуществе у новичков идет речь? ""Спавнишься сразу со всеми перками"" - так это не зависит от того новичок ты или нет - это для всех игроков. И все игроки рано или поздно возьмут новый ствол без прокачки и будут бегать без обвесов. И не раз, потому что это колда. Ты качаешь пушки, выполняешь испытания, качаешь уровень - в этом и фишка серии. И главному элементу, мультиплэеру, в обзоре уделено в два раза меньше, чем огрызку в виде кампании. Браво.
При чем самое смешное, что я согласен с автором. МВ 3 - это раздутое ДЛС для МВ 2 за 70 баксов (которых она никаким местом не стоит), поскольку Активижн нужно было выпустить колду до покупки Майками. Но уж тот момент, где МВ 3 точно лучше предшественников (МВ 2 и Вангард), а именно мультиплэер, я не могу понять почему не получается осветить по достоинству. Проведи в игре на 10-15 часов дольше. Да, обзор выйдет на 1-2 дня позже, но он станет качественнее. Это уже какая-то ежегодная комедия уровня Ёлки, когда Стопгейм выпускает обзор на колду и больше срет себе в штаны, нежели выпускает качественный контент
Видите же, что у вас нет авторов, которые играют в колду. Что Карамышев, что Уэс, что вот Орлов (хотя на двух последних я больше согласен, чем на Карамышева, его обзоры по колде смотрелись на уровне Зеленого слоника). Найдите стороннего человека, который действительно играет в колду. Который может рассказать чем действительно отличается игра от предыдущих, что лучше, что хуже. Негоже такому великому порталу в ру-сегменте выставлять себя клоунами (хотя тут уже полный цирк), еще и каждый год",2023-12-22T15:43:03Z,4

With the release of Black Hawk Down, they’ve shown how to balance multiplayer and campaign modes effectively. Call of Duty could learn a thing or two from them.",2024-12-11T19:35:27Z,0

Also the old dlc’s from back in the day were more 15 dollars and if you bought all four it would be less than how much this game cost and you would get better maps, better weapons, and a better call of duty zombies experience.

Dg5Yy8GDpkc,@KarimM-m4u,"That doesn’t make the previous map pack model good, because we live in a time where people expect free updates and maps. 140 dollars for 1 game is unacceptable in this day and age. Activision is obviously very greedy because they still charge this amount to this day even with their older games, which is just gross. For 20 bucks I could get doom eternal deluxe edition with all the dlc and cosmetics, and yet it can’t get me the full black ops 3 experience. Doom eternal content wise is extremely similar to call of duty because they are both shooters with a multiplayer, an extra side mode like zombies or spec ops. And an infinitely longer campaign. So yeah, if you’re dissatisfied with cod, go buy, doom eternal. It’s a game where you run around shooting guys like cod, but it’s astronomically cheaper.",2024-09-08T20:18:50Z,0

neRerKKJo_k,@RevanSecura,Personally I'd call the story mediocre at best and I've only seen review videos of it so far but if there's a positive to it it's that the enemy AI are supposedly so dumb that it lets a new player get the hang of things without too much difficulty. but to be completely serious and brutally honest I think Final Fantasy 7 Remake did the short adventure concept better by a longshot. in FF7R you were limited to only playing through the Midgar tutorial content that was only 15 minutes in the OG game when you got the hang of things but expanded upon in FF7R to be a 50 hour game on the base game alone when you do everything the game has to offer. so all in all it's apparent Activision and/or Sony is suffering from some serious franchise fatigue if the campaign modes are being given the sideshow spectacle treatment while the multiplayer mode gets most of the attention.,2024-01-05T23:46:10Z,0

neRerKKJo_k,@trentberry1019,"What’s crazy about this review is that I’m a 47 year old lifetime gamer.  It’s amazing to see how far video games have come in my lifetime.  Call Of Duty is a staple in my life, I’ve played them all, campaigns & multiplayer.  Not big on warzone & I think that’s because let’s face it I’m old & it’s the old dog new tricks syndrome.

I have two young adult kids ages 26 & 21 & I raised them on online gaming.  I divorced when they were young & I used online gaming as a way to keep the bond with my children during the early co parenting years.  Call Of Duty was where we spent the most time.  On weekends when they were at my house we’d play & loved it.  

But today it’s not the same, my kids are older & they still game just as strongly but they’re off to other gaming franchises & I still get excited for the new CoD every fall/winter.  Today sadly, I play alone.  They don’t even own a CoD & haven’t in years.  

So I get where you’re coming from but I don’t know, maybe this my way of holding on to the past because I thoroughly enjoyed this campaign.  I play on the hardest difficulty so that made it a lot more challenging & though it was short I stretched it out to about a week & a half as my work & life demands would allow me to give it the time I would’ve in the past.

The graphics & gameplay was dope to me.  I even got engaged in the story.  I’m on to multiplayer now & it’s just as cool.  So all that being said, maybe it’s an old man thing.  If so, I hope they never stop producing them because I can’t do Fortnite.  🤣🤣🤣",2023-11-27T08:36:46Z,5

Been SICK of the bs battle royal gimmick aka Warzone. $70 for a game that the actual game could have been a DLC, hell no, plus I heard that they F'd up zombies by not having it round based (which is how Zombies is) but they had to ruin it with the Warzone crap..

I haven't played MW3 but I have played every PC version since the first one was released. COD1 was the hardest I believe. 


This way you extend your playtime and make those random MP like situations more challenging. Of course.. the flow of the story is not as smooth (depending on your skill, lol). But with sniper missions etc. it forces you to think through your actions much more differently thus making the story more realistic.

I relaunched COD World at war and tried casual ""Normal"" mode. The first mission was too fast, too easy, boring. Because I didn't have to pay any attention to the pacific enemy, i didn't care. But with veteran- I'm actually cared of the suicidal bayonet guys.. oh my..

Good thing I kept my promise I know COD Campaigns are relatively short but this, this is way to short, shorter than any other Campaigns I've seen aren't they like 4 to 5 hours long or at the least 4 hours and it doesn't feel like they put effort on it. I remember a time when COD games had an outstanding Campaign. Because the companies put effort on it but now it's just like here's a mini Campaign we don't care about take it.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is an abomination. It's a Frankenstein monster stitched together with bits and pieces of previous game. It's clear this was meant to be an expansion but Sledgehammer was forced to turn it into a full-priced premium game. But does MW3 deserve to be the WORST reviewed Call of Duty game? Lets find out...

ekb-QcKeHio,@Victor-056,"The reason This version of ""No Russian"" was made, was a poor attempt to push an ""Anti-Gun Rethoric"", as the Glock used was _supposed_ to be a Quote/Unquote ""Ghost Gun made from Ceramic Parts that is invisible to metal detectors"", which is why it was _White..._ Which makes _zero_ sense as a ""Ghost Gun"" is simply a gun with 3D Printed parts, and thus, won't show up in a National Gun Registry because it lacks a serial number.

That is all that it is, a Gun made from 3D Printed parts that does not have _serial numbers._The parts that handle the bullets (Such as the Barrel) _STILL_ need to be made from _METAL_ as they have to handle the sheer heat of the propellent being burnt as well as the bullet flying out at mach one point one... And the Casings are made of _BRASS_ for the same reason as the barrel, which show up on Metal Detectors as well.

Activision basically thinks people are completely lacking in brains and will follow a rethoric that is utter Pigwash.",2025-01-10T08:16:15Z,0

That doesn't fix anything, the bomb will still detonate even if the persons dead. 2. The person is actively trying to stop the bomb from going off, so why in the hell would you prevent them from disarming it? 

It would have been a much more impactful scene if the passangers gave the phone to her, but she couldn't disarm it, and they were left to wait untill it detonated. But noooo, we're gonna have the passengers all be deaf and try to kill her! God mw3 is stupid",2025-01-23T21:16:54Z,0

70 quid for 2 hours of gameplay and a multiplayer that's an update's worth of gameplay tweaks and a £10 DLC map pack of remasters...

Absolutely disgusting IMO. Modern COD is already recycle heaven with absolutely no difference in gameplay feel between each game, but it's soooo dumb.

What it does do is stop the nerves from working leading to you body basically freezing kinda like a form of electrocution where the nerves stop telling the body what to do leading to death. It doesn't take much to kill you & can pass through skin. No idea why they said a real nerve gas instead of some made up one like Black ops did because a made up one can do what they want & allow him to survive by their odd logic.,2024-09-22T17:50:27Z,0
LlXs8U2rA6s,@cillianennis9921,"I really hate open combat missions they are basically the bad missions of the Battlefield campaigns that was present in Battlefield 1 & 5. 1 they where alright but 5 they where so boring I never finished the game. Same feeling here. I prefer some choice like you had in COD Black ops 2 & Infinite warfare where you can chose what mission to play next & have some control over how to approach the mission but not making me run around a silly map & clear objectives & hunt collectables. The 1st open combat one is fine but the 2nd just ends up being kinda boring as you are on your own & feel like a one man army instead of being in a small fire team where you are kinda leading the battle which would be a far more interesting version of this concept. Halo basically does this & it does it the best unlike MW3 which kinda makes levels feel odd. Like where did ghost go after the jump? he was with you right? I haven't finished it yet but I don't feel confident in the rest of the game. So glad Game pass let me play it without wasting money on it.
Edit: I think your point about Solo vs Co-op explains why I prefer the style in Halo because you never really play a Halo game alone you usually have someone on mic or on your sofa playing it together & trying to work together or against each other allowing the open nature to allow fun tactics. I also think the Tom Clancy games like Rainbow Six the older ones do similar missions well by allowing you to command fireteams which is similar to what you do in Black ops 2's special operations missions where you basically command squads to take multiple points or defend multiple points. Its basically too lonely to work.",2024-09-22T17:39:06Z,0

LlXs8U2rA6s,@aaronhunter6268,Keeping Makarov alive by saying “He’s in custody he’s not going anywhere” is so stupid. Imagine Seal Team 6 conducting their raid on Osama Bin Ladens compound and instead of killing the world’s most notorious terrorist they take him into custody.

I understand the campaign was the worst to me at the person who focus playing the campaign first I have to say that’s probably one of the worst campaigns second to Vanguard. But you can’t lie that the multiplayer had a crap ton of content. But when modern warfare three came out, you can’t lie that there’s a lot of content that came out with it for example like there’s weekly events that you can get to make your gun different for example like the M-16 from modern warfare two that makes it from my burst to a fully automatic gun an if you complete all the weekly challenges, you get a weekly seasonal camo. And plus all the events that you get there’s always a camo or a free blueprint.",2025-01-11T18:24:57Z,0

I tried installing the game on an old computer that still had a CD-rom but the computer wouldn’t accept the game so I literally just copied the files on to a flash drive and then tried installing it on my new laptop.

There's a lot of issues with the game but in terms of pure gameplay it was one of my favorites and definitely my most played, probably only second to blops3 and that's a hard maybe. I can't give a definitive opinion on the other new-gen CODs because I haven't gotten them because I'm done spending 60$ on a game that's basically the same as the previous one but having to start all over grinding unlocks and shit but to this day 2019 is one of my absolute favorites, and I still continue to play it as well",2025-01-29T03:02:45Z,0

There’s a reason I deleted bo6 and redownloaded any and everything before Bo4. Anything before bo4 was priceless the loading screens, the intros to zombies the campaign. They’ve gotten lazy.

Но обидно, что его тупо, как второстепенного персонажа, снесли, а не того, с кого Колда и начиналась.

Play on Veteran or Realism if available and it’s a complete different experience to playing on recruit or regular. barely anyone has unlocked the Hardened achievement which is embarrassing cause it’s actually too easy on Hardened difficulty.

Then everything is kept hush-hush after the gates of hell almost opened.

The campaign is just a taste of what the game is going to be about and provides a setting to have fun with your friends.

-VnRGSRCSC8,@WhattheHeck-n6p,"10:23 for those who don’t know, The Glock 19 is a semi-automatic pistol that operates using a short recoil, locked-breech system. Here’s a basic breakdown of how it works:

1. Firing Cycle
	•	When the trigger is pulled, the striker-fired mechanism releases the firing pin, which strikes the primer of the chambered round.
	•	This ignites the gunpowder inside the cartridge, creating high-pressure gas that propels the bullet down the barrel.

2. Recoil and Ejection
	•	The force of the shot pushes the slide rearward while the barrel unlocks and tilts slightly downward.
	•	As the slide moves back, the spent casing is extracted and ejected from the chamber.
	•	The recoil spring then forces the slide forward, chambering a new round from the magazine.

3. Reset and Ready to Fire
	•	The striker is partially cocked as the slide returns to its forward position.
	•	The trigger resets, allowing the pistol to fire again with the next pull.
