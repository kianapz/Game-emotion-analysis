BrechiGOD,100,"Overwarch es un juegazo, ha tenido cambios inesperados pero es un goty! Démosle 1 oportunidad"
K2nnyMcCorm1ck,10,"The game crashes after the last update - get a penalty! The server disconnected - reconnect and, yes, get a penalty! Fabulous! Gameplay - WOW. You may tryhard as a pro, but will be killed in a millisecond, and on the enemy's kill-cam you will see like you stayed still in some corner and did nothing... Desyncs, desyncs everywhere! It is perfect to get rid of some time of your life. It is the worst option to improve and/or show your skills. Stinky..."
CobaltCommander,80,"This game is awesome, it has good gameplay, fun characters and some interesting lore if you want to dig into it, it is a great game and I enjoy it quite a bit."
jxstjxlius,50,"Auch wenn das Spiel nur ein ehrenloser Cashgrab von Blizzard ist, kann man nicht abstreiten, dass das Spiel an sich gut ist. Es wird immer wieder geupdatet und die Events sind auch zumeist okay. Ein Fehlen der PvE Kämpfe und der Kampagne ist trotzdem sehr spürbar."
sierra5,20,"Recently, my account was suddenly suspended without any prior warning or clear explanation. The response from customer support was completely unhelpful, which has led me to seriously question the quality of Blizzard's service."
Raknner44,90,"Al igual que muchos otros juegos online el emparejamiento no tiene ningún filtro, no existe. El control es bueno perono sirve de nada si te ponen jugadores muy veteranos y principiantes."
Evil_MC,90,There are some people on here who are hurt because minor things have changed in the game. At core this is still the best hero shooter. Yes it's better than marvel rivals. It's a lot of fun. There is a store and micro transactions like all ftp games. But I never felt the need to buy anything as it's only skins.
JahBoiChipsAhoy,0,"Since its release, the game has slowly let down players. What started as a fun hero-shooter in 2016 with Overwatch 1 has now turned into a sad cash grab that is getting the life squeezed out of it by the developers. Similar to Titanic, the game felt very innovative and quite enjoyable, but once it hit the iceberg, known as cooperation greed, it slowly started to sink into the ocean. The game/ship is now almost completely submerged yet the crew is still trying to sell overpriced **** and souvenirs. Any difference this game had to its predecessor is now completely stripped away due to the addition of 6v6. Do not play this game, save yourself the headache and spare your brain cells."
savage2222,50,"Hey do you like having fun, don't play this game. The only reason I'm not giving a 3 or a 4 is because It is free and sometimes it could be fun to play customs with friends."
Sush665,10,I can’t take it. They took one of my favorite games and made it unrecognizable. The greed coming from blizzard genuinely needs to be studied. I’m done and will never go back.
DJjeff,0,"Bad game, bad company. I like getting milked but not like this. This is the perfect example of anti-consumer practices."
SuperbPlayer,0,Just a lazier and a downgrade going to 5v5. Disappointing that this couldn't deliver the PVE with all the promises made years before this game was released.
DiamondsDo98,70,"Coming to back to Overwatch, thankfully in overwatch 2 I keep all my goodies from first game, sadly they fail to promise Us full on story mode with our beloved **** more loot box to be honest I miss its make getting skin earnable by playing fun. The battle passe its aright not bad its do-ble to lv up, only **** is paying for premium ver. every season. so, earning skin potential is limited.6 v 6 is now 5 v 5 so if you got 6 friends one of them is getting bench.I'm Reinhart main player only. got all the skins so, it's okay they add more characters to keep the game fresh. Also, more for me glorious Victory and HONOR. updated: glad they brought the 6v6 back."
DarkHand,30,"Ils ont remplacé les shield par les soins. Ils est régulièrement impossible de tué quelqu'un tellement il y a de soins. La ranked et le sbmm sont cassés. Si vous avez le malheur de gagner trop de parties, le jeu vous mettra avec des joueurs qui sont mauvais et il vous sera quasiment impossible de gagner. Horriblement frustrant. Nous retirer overwatch 1 que l'on a payer! Pour nous imposser cette horreur. Plus jamais je ne dépense 1€ pour un produit blizzard."
Bastion750,50,"5 за системы скрытого пула, 50 на 50 и сломанный ранкед и бесконечное количество смурфов. А ну да, ещё перманентные баны аккаунта за чат и рандомные репорты"
Schokirunner,10,"Just disappointing gameplay. Ontop of that, it's just an absolutely evil company"
Marwanba,0,this is **** worst game ever and the worst teams ever and also the worst characters
Danyhatory,10,Overwatch 1 was better but this this S is disappointed for too many reasons the season pass are bad the skins cost too much the bugs ruined the game and the worst part it go woke
StasZhem98,20,"I have paid full price for this game several years ago. For some reason I recently received a pathetic and lazy money grabber. All the new skins, graffiti’s etc feel outsourced and just outright lazy as hell. The first game was 8.5 out of 10 and that’s being very strict. This game is a 3, and all of them because of the first game’s legacy. I do not know who came up with all these new ideas, but this person should never have any influence on any game whatsoever again. This is outrageous and pathetic."
Electrified1337,10,"Unfortunately, if this is the original Overwatch, I would give a 8/10. However, with comparison, OW2 is just so disappointing and I just feel OW2 doesn't deserve to be an underdog to it's predecessor, in all aspect, from gameplay, lore, animation to music, this just disappointed me. I expected any game with a ""2"" should have at least some upgrades from 1. However, what I saw from OW2 was general downgrade, and the PvE promised never delivers and they just updated numerous shop cash grab skin contents to hide the fact that they did nothing in5 years. If its simply the game itself I would give a 5/10, but with such a poor developing team, I can't bother giving any good score."
kiozen,70,"*Overwatch 2* aims to build on the success of its predecessor, introducing several significant changes while preserving the core gameplay that made *Overwatch* a phenomenon. The shift to a 5v5 team format (from 6v6) is a major change, enhancing the speed and intensity of matches and reducing overall chaos, though it requires teams to adapt strategies and redefine roles. The reworked hero abilities and new additions enrich gameplay options, though balance adjustments remain a critical **** game introduces new maps and modes, including *Push*, which brings a fresh dynamic and demands new strategies. *Overwatch 2* also expands the narrative with PvE (Player vs Environment) missions that allow players to dive deeper into the characters’ stories and motivations. However, while the PvE missions are interesting, they have yet to achieve the depth that some fans anticipated, remaining largely short and sporadic experiences.Visually, the game has been upgraded with improved lighting effects and more refined details, yet it retains its iconic, colorful style. The soundtrack and sound design remain engaging and enhance immersion, much like in the original game. However, changes to the progression system—with the introduction of a battle pass and fewer free cosmetic rewards—have faced criticism from the **** summary, *Overwatch 2* introduces meaningful updates to gameplay and storytelling while retaining the vibrant, team-based action that defines the series, though certain changes have sparked mixed reactions among fans."
gjostie,70,my go-to game at the moment despite the utter torture it puts me through every time i boot it up. i feel like everything promised during the overwatch 1 days were not delivered and now we're stuck with a meh game with 30 million microtransactions. i love causing myself pain as support main but eh
mikelikemike,10,"Like we would ever forget what they took from us, and what they promised us. Yes we dislike what you made overwatch into, you whale-farming greedy a-holes."
GUXTAMAINVIPER,90,"Um jogo revolucionário na indústria dos fps personagens muito divertidos ótima jogabilidade Mais a galera taca hate porque esperavam que ia vir mais coisa,em geral é mesma coisa do 1 com algumas diferenças EXTREMAMENTE SUBESTIMADO"
Lukituki,20,"Whole point of Overwatch 2 was PvE Campaign, but they cancel that for no reason. Many of PvP things Goes on Bad way. They deleted lootboxes, that feature was a whole point of grinding and still playing this game - now there is a Battlepass, but It is not good. When you spend money ~10USD, and get all tiers, you only get 50% of coins of battlepass price, so that means you need to buy MicroTransactions every season to get ,,grinding"" system back, because free levels are bad and no one want to grind them - It is Bad, because other games with battlepass system, just giving you full refund of coins etc. after you complete all tiers. Blizzard only think about money, every season they just finding a new way to add new Coins/MicroTransactions. Season 13 is now here and there is some LITTLE changes, that means nothing for new mechanics for gameplay etc. Season 13 only added new cosmetics that costs Money, and thats All. Overwatch 2 is sometimes fun with gameplay for like 1-2 matches per day/week, but I do not see any reason to play this game more often. Everything is Bad, Devs don't care about Players, only on Skins and MicroTransactions."
MMAJay,0,Ahhh OverRATED 2! This game **** so much eggplant I’d rather play TF2! Nothing beats the original hero shooter of the 2000s. How a game that released in 2007 have better gameplay mechanics and innovation than this sewage container is beyond me. No wonder Mike Morhaime left. He saw his baby Blizzard grow up and started doing something strange for some change. This series is just WoW as an FPS. Bonus: it’s free!
SaraLyn,0,"Firstly, I am a female gamer and MERCY player. I have been playing Overwatch for 8 years. I used to have happy times for the past 7 years. But this year 2024, I was being bullied in-game. When I randomly match with players who are sharper than others, the other players will insult me something like""b**ch mercy"", ""booster cheating"", ""team with cheating"", and even bully me by maliciously reporting me. If I continue to play Mercy regardless of my opponent's insults, my opponent will report me for ""joining the queue with accounts marked as cheating"". If I stop cheering and wait for the match to end, my teammates will report me for ""not limited to, not participating in the game"". Now, all players know that if I am reported too many times, my account will be permanently banned. Even though I didn't violate the Blizzard rules, I will be treated and bullied like this just because I am a female player, and my main hero is Mercy. I currently do not play games with friends in my team, do not join voice chat, and block all text chat. Still, my account was permanently banned. I don't know how I can do to protect my account. I think Blizzard is right to crack down on cheating players, but I don't know why you guys always banning non-cheating players as well? This will not make the game environment better, because no matter whether the player cheats or not, they 're accounts will be banned. So, more and more players will choose to create new accounts to cheat because their main accounts have been wrongly banned! I sincerely hope that Blizzard can listen to players' suggestions and modify the ban mechanism. I request that our account be unbanned immediately! I greatly appreciate your time in reading my appeal and sincerely await your positive response."
IronicKlutch,0,Who still plays this junk? I rather play ET the game over this trailer trash
fbo_rik,90,"Overwatch is still an unique experience among countless FPS competitive games. Art style, game fee,l UI, sound are amazing. It is a pity that the game coudn't deliver on their earlier promises of expanded modes such as PvE modes. Although what is present is very well made. As far as live service, i feel it is very well supported (oct 2024). Patches come in a good cadence and devs do a good job wth communication with the community. Balancing is not perfect, (and never will in any competitive game) But there are enough changes so any greater inbanlance is smoothed out. For anyone that doesn't have much time; Cosmetic rewards from battle pass and events are not too much ****; you dont need to play every single day and feel like a chore. And the art for cosmetics in this gam is actually one of the few in the industry i actually think is worth paying for Most of the negatives from my experience come from the competitive aspect; sometimes it is just frustating to deal with other players, theres tools for that but they just remedy it a bit. Also the game is very fast paced and learning or coming back to it after a while can feel overwhelming. For monetazation i feel the battle pass is mostly worth it; But shop cosmetics feel very expensive; thankfully everything is completily options and its not hard to get some good customization for free or cheap for some of your most played heroes."
eeman55,70,"Overwatch: a game, of which innovative for its time of release, entails a fast, action-packed gameplay, involving “heroes” which you play with. However, Blizzard released a second version Overwatch 2, which was created to mediate the decrease in the popularity of the initial Overwatch, which held promise. The initial stages of Overwatch 2 indeed increased the lost interest of Overwatch 1, especially during the initial stages of the sequels release, new maps, new characters. It could be said that it seemed promising. However, as time went on from the sequel’s release, more and more flaws, complaints arose from the sequel, mostly critiquing the main attraction of the game – the gameplay. The main premise of Overwatch is for 2 teams to complete an objective, of which induces fights between these teams to progress their objectives. The main difference between Overwatch 2 and 1 is that the sequel has 5v5 instead of 6v6. Whilst superficially, it could be perceived as a novelty change to the game, instead this proved to be a major problem for the player base, and an even bigger problem for the “old” player base. This “flaw” consisted of the fact that they reduced the initial 2 tank roles to only 1 in role-based matchmaking, although in open queue they do not have this problem as there is not a cap in the roles. The decrease from 2 tanks to 1 tank led to drastic changes to the tanks’ stats and abilities, which is quite difficult to balance, whilst also decreasing the number of combinations in the heroes you can pick, making the “meta” (the current best combinations of characters) vastly more prominent definitive in if you win a match or not. One of the main charms of the initial Overwatch is the number of combinations of characters there could be, and the viability in each character, whilst there still being a main “meta”. But in the sequel, you would tend to see a repeat of the same characters depending on the viability of each character/ character combination, hence why I would rate Overwatch 2 a moderate level below the original game in terms of “fun” gameplay. Overwatch 2 also boasts a variety of game modes apart from the main modes, unranked and competitive (ranked), and allow for community created game modes in the workshop. This allows for the community to create specific maps for aim, parkour, talking to others, and even trying to replicate RPG inside. Gameplay: 7.5/10 Learning Curve: Depends on what character you play. Enjoyability: Biased depending on whether you played Overwatch 1 or not. 6/10-9/10 Playability: Available on console and PC, also involves cross platform gameplay, allowing for better multiplayer experiences. 9/10 Replayability: 9/10; due to the 5–15-minute games for quickplay and 10–30-minute games for competitive. Nonetheless, apart from the gameplay, there has been moderate changes to the GUI, which could be, subjectively “cleaner” and more visually appealing, and quite interesting novel changes like “mythic skins”, which were decently well received by the community. They also changed Overwatch from paid access to free to play, albeit in the early stages of the sequel, still putting characters through a paywall - entailed a backlash. Feedback response: 8/10 Graphics wise, Overwatch 2 retains most of its cartoony aspect that it had in Overwatch 1, not very high on the graphics, therefore easier to run on most platforms. It could be said that Overwatch is much more **** focused game rather than graphics, SFX, etc, therefore a lot less time is spent towards making the game “look better”, and more time is focused on balancing heroes. Graphics: 7/10 Holistically, the sequel could be said to be a success, bringing in a new player base. However, Overwatch 2 currently is not on par Overwatch 1; commonly regarded as one of the greatest games of its time, period. Overall rating: 7.5/10."
Saneperson356,80,"Overwatch is a 5vs5 team-based tactical shooter with loads of well designed characters and maps that present an incredible level of depth of understanding and skill that provide thousands of hours of intense gameplay the character’s are designed very well with abilities revolving around different playstyles split up into three categories tank, dps and support each one playing a vital role in winning the game. However the balancing of these characters can be a little off and the community can be a little toxic even in game modes that are not meant to be competitive this was not helped by the developers adding leavers penalty into quick play forcing everyone to stay in a one sided game against their will this can create an unfun and demoralising experience in a mode that is not meant to be taken seriously. This has created a weird dynamic where the unranked game mode is taken more seriously than the ranked game mode. Talking about ranked the only game mode where you will actually have fun on this game spending countless hours trying to make an icon display on your profile showing that you are slightly better than the people with other icons on there profiles stroking your own ego and releasing slight amount of dopamine to then have it wear off after a day and instantly start trying to hit the next rank. Not to mention before you are even able to compete in ranked you have to sink a good couple hundred hours as overwatch is one of the more complicated e-sports Also the developers receive criticism for making overwatch 2 free to play this may not sound like a bad at first but it means blizzard has to make their money through micro transactions that are incredibly overpriced leading players to drop stupid amounts of money for skins they could of received for free simply by playing overwatch 1. However, if you look past these problems you get an addictive shooter with a good competitive scene and a passionate developers wanting the game to succeed."
QAOSbringer,20,"Overwatch 1 was one of the last good games Blizzard made. When Overwatch 2 was announced, we were hoping for a better version of Overwatch 1. It was said that it would be especially PvE focused. The most missing things in Overwatch 1 were story and scenario modes, we were excited that we would have the opportunity to play the background lore prepared for Overwatch 1 as singleplayer campaigns and taste that world. What came out was a cheap F2P version of Overwatch 1 that was dumbed down and slain with micropurchases. They didn't care to fix Overwatch 1's balance and matchmaking issues either, even worse, they messed up the ranking system further and removed important features. Everything worth playing Overwatch 1 has been thrown away in this second game. 2: Intolerable - Bad enough to make you refund the game."
Bradyherbst7,70,"Heres my problem with overwatch 2. It's overwatch, and overwatch is fun... If this game wasn't fun, we wouldn't play it. Blizzard would be forced to fix it, but it is fun, so they'll continue to sell overpriced micro transactions, not fix the bugs, and lock characters behind paywall or some other stupid thing."
tomboh,70,"It's fun but I wouldn't play it over any other modern tac shooter. The more you play the less fun it is and the more you see the sbmm be an actual disease. If you want to play a good tac shooter, play THE FINALS, it's free and underrated, it will hold your attention for a at least a week or you'll become a long time player."
Gorelord,10,They didn't deliver on basically the most important promises they made about the game and then found ways to nickel and dime. Deserves all the hate and the company ruined their entire reputation doing things like this.
Geckoss,100,Overwatach 2 **** honestly but I have been playing for 6 years and I cant let go please help me.
Swyftl,40,"Overwatch 2 is a shameless money grab from Blizzard. The game just Overwatch one, but instead it is free. They use the excuse that it is free to shove constant micro transactions and battle passes down your throat whilst offering out previously rare and difficult to obtain skins for purchase that players of the first game took pride in owning. Players of the first game got no reward for their nearly $60 purchase, and blizzard just pocketed their money and moved on, as per usual."
Kreepit,0,"A management team who are completely disconnected from the community. They cater to content creators while ignoring the majority of their player base. Cheating and smurfing is a massive issue in this game and it's made even worse when the cheaters in this game are allowed to run rampant for months before getting removed in a ban wave. Then there's the horrible rank progression system and the way it works when someone leave a competitive match, which have insane consequences for the 4 players remaining on the team. The game literally PUNISH players on the team if a random team member leave a competitive match by adding a loss to their account. The rank progression system also remove more rank progress when you lose compared to what you gain when you win. Whoever came up with such an outrageously bad system that punish those left on the team when someone leave a competitive match should be fired.. If someone tilts and rage quits a competitive match, the lobby should close down, with no change to anyone's rank progress and SR other than the idiot who left because their ego got hurt. The matchmaker in this game is hands down the worst i've ever seen in any competitive games i've played since i started playing competitive shooters back in the very early Quake days. All in all, for the vast majority of players who play in lower ranks, this is happening on a daily basis. Matchmaker matching bronze players with gold players where the game sense and mechanical skills of a bronze vs gold player is like night and day. The rank division system is one that needs to be removed and revert the entire rank system back to OW1 standards with visible SR and more."
Bonkus,10,Just team fortress 2 but for gooners with no life whatsoever if you think this game is good go play some actually good fps games like halo and tf2
loyonel,100,"mejor que esa basura de Concord en el genero de los hero shooter, con culos, tetas y minas muy buenas y sin pronombres rancios"
Albini_Rates,10,"Wie kann man nur so unfassbar gut gemachte Charaktere in eine so genialen Welt erschaffen und das Game dann so versauen. Kein Singleplayer, warum? Bzw. war dieser unfassbar teuer, und dazu auch noch eher mittelmäßig. Mittelmäßige Grafik im Vergleich zu dem, wie es sein könnte (Zeigen die Pixar-ähnlichen Kurzfilme, die alle samt in den Bereich Oskar gehörten, wenn man mich fragt), die Story auch eher mittelmäßig und dazu hat man angefangen mehr auf Diversity in einem der diversesten Games überhaupt zu achten. Warum? Und noch eine letzte Frage: Warum musste man die Lootboxen entfernen? Overwatch war ein Vorzeigebeispiel von funktionierenden Lootboxen, die einem nicht das Geld aus der Tasche zogen, die Ingame gewonnen werden konnten und die nur Kosmetische Vorteile brachten. Ich kann mir denken warum, man wollte sich der ""Kritik"" entziehen, die andere Entwickler abbekommen haben und dazu noch mehr Geld mit dem Battlepass erwirtschaften (, der warum auch immer nicht genügend Ingame-Währung enthält, um ihn sich beim nächsten Mal wieder zu holen). Es ist einfach schwach, was aus diesem Game geworden ist. Mehr als die Kurzfilme werde ich davcon nicht mehr anschauen, denn da steckt noch Herz drin."
Zpocalypse,60,"One of the better FPS in my opinion. Its one of those games that has a grip on me and wont let go. I keep finding myself wanting to play it and going back to it ever since I started it 7 years ago. No matter how many times I get upset with or tired of the game, give it some time and it will call to me again like the green goblin mask."
chokepoint,10,"it's just boring - there is no real content other than role queue, which gets old really fast. unfortunately again, the dev effort is focused on cash shop items, not gameplay. overwatch 1 was better and way less monetised."
OlafSzwast133,10,"This game shouldn't have been released. It's still an overwatch, but everything about it, is a misunderstanding."
JKaiya,30,"Loved the game but the farther it went on its life cycle the worse the game became due to the decisioning of new characters added and the nerfs/buffs, and especially lack of changes to fix hard metas like goats. The metagame switch counters also became too heavy. Overwatch 2 was also just a whole lie to the fan base."
aboody60,100,"The game is good in the competitive mode, but the gameplay in the other modes is bad. There is no creativity in the other modes, but the gameplay system is very wonderful. However, the only negative aspect of the game is that the arcade mode is bad."
72Vanish,0,"Fxcking ELO，less charactor，Can match the same team 5 times.When there are no friends to play with, there is no joy at all, and it requires a lot of cooperation"
zionthegoat,60,"Even though blizzard is run by **** idiots that made Overwatch 2 inferior to the original, Overwatch's core gameplay is so good that the game still manages to be pretty fun, if a little frustrating. The fact that we aren't getting PvE like we were promised still pisses me off though."
TokemonX,40,"Game is filled with lots of 'relatable' shallow characters. The company had a chance to remedy this through cinematic cutscenes, more backstories, improved cgi for the pve and less annoying shield Meta. Overwatch really for years has fallen into the trap of 'if we can rebalance, lets do so' and made the game absolutely repugnant compared to when it released. Tank is not fun and barely requires any skille now, theres no concept of retreating or even a way to escape, its mostly just 'help the tank' which every other team mate does. Its never been a 1v1 game, but it feel even less versatile now with no variation of which character to pick. This is insane to me and it ruins any way for now players to enjoy the game, this should only be reserve for competitive, but apparent ly blizzard did notunderstand not everyone wants to play that. Pretty much everyone understands the big ass scam blizzard has made, making skins and herpes cost as much as a full game, so the 'free to play' is an illusion if you want to play the full game, unlike the old game where you could unlock New characters, skins, voice lines through free loot boxes. Gameplay is still fun, but man, paying tank is so easy unless ur fighting a tank. 3.5/10"
vhyles,0,"They promised PvE, which was most likely a sham from the get-go, then seeing they wouldn't be able to deliver anything new they TOOK AWAY content by removing one tank, and praised this as if it's a groundbreaking novelty... all that with the goal of justifying the '2' after the title and justify the making of a 'new' game, which paves the way for them to change the MONETIZATION MODEL and rake in as much as corporate cash as possible thanks to selling overpriced skins to kids and new players who have never played the original Overwatch. The zombification and basterdization of a title, just in the name of pure corporate greed, nothing more nothing less fellas. You know what, let's take away the on-fire, the medals, the cards, the level borders too while we're at it... and add a bland scoreboard no one asked for. Oh, the lootboxes too of course! Let's take them away too! Why give our playerbase the possibility to receive any esthetic in the game for free, while they can pay 10 bucks for a keychain, and 30 bucks for a skin! **** you Blizzard, **** you for deleting Overwatch and then parading this lifeless corpse **** so as to squeeze as much as cash as possible."
