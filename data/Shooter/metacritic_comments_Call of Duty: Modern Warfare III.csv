Klofi,40,"Not a bad idea to make a non-linear CoD, but this one is badly executed, feels scripted and unpolished, not a real sandbox. Very short story with some stupid writing, but also couple very rememberable moments. Excelent art design and environment design. Not worth a full price, should be a 20$ DLC to MWII."
Mizule,0,"This game is a Scam. Don't ever pay money for this! It should be a free DLC for the old MWs. Further, its a overly colorful unrealistic arcadegame which has nothing to do with the original CoD games. The worst thing are the battle passes andthe forceful tries to make you pay more money. Glad I only tried it via Game Pass, deleted it after 3 rounds."
KILLERBUTGAMER,40,"While I may not be a long fan of the series, I made up my expectations for this game by the standards set by other players, so, like many other players, I felt that the game was a large disappointment to the modern warfare reboot, and the franchise as a whole. The gunplay is, as always, one of the best in the genre. Honestly, I believe that it is really hard to mess up such a strong-standing FPS recipe. The movement is also quite responsive and satisfying to nail, and probably the best in the MW rebooted games. The multiplayer is also good, as long as the modes and pacing is concerned, but it starts to really fall when you look at the abysmal Skill-Based Matchmaking system. It is well known at this point that the MW3 SBMM is there to maximize the time a player spends playing, not their enjoyment. While they aren't the first to do that, it most definitely more obvious and obnoxious here. It creates a really bad 'toxic-relationship', where the moment you are ready to give the game up, the game puts you in the most amazing matches, before starting to ruin them again. The balance however is really good, and the time-to-kill is also quite good. Now, when it comes to the campaign...I probably have the strongest feelings for it, and most of them aren't great. Now, I won't spoil anything, but I want to make clear that the campaign was very obviously made to be a DLC to the MW2 campaign. Most story missions take place in areas of Verdansk that we have played in before, in Warzone, and instead of being the linear levels we are used to, now they are some small-scale sandbox missions. What they did, is drop the player into a previously seen POI of Verdansk, spawn some horrible AI NPCs, add a marker at a place, and when the player reaches it-boom, a cutscene. Now, you've already heard how tiny the runtime is. If you take away any cutscenes and unplayable parts out, the game comes in at a pathetic, 3 hour campaign, if you really take your time. While historically the runtimes in the franchise haven't been that large, 3 hours is way too short for any sort of story to pick up and climax properly, and also 70$ is crazy for that time to beat. The writing is also not good, and also proves the fact that this was supposed to be a DLC for MW2. The story takes it time to pick of the pace and momentum, and by the time that happens, the game is already have done. And just when when things start to get hot, after a very shocking choice by the writers, the story ends, leaving you with a serious case of blue-balls. It doesn't finish naturally, it doesn't reach a conclusion, but most importantly, it doesn't move the overall story forward. So, when you understand that the story doesn't feel like it has a begging-middle-end, it feels like it is lacking ****, that's right; the MW 2 campaign. The story doesn't stand at it's own by itself at all, but would do fine if it was simply an extension to the MW2 campaign, for a lower Price. Overall, the game is fine when it comes to the gunplay and feel, but when it comes to the multiplayer experience, it starts to get painful. The story also isn't any good, and it basically changes nothing in the overall story, while also ending at the worst time. I'd personally say to keep your hard-earned cash for Black Ops 6, which seems promising or any other Call Of Duty game, really."
scalebag,0,"Metacritic strikes again. Deleting the review apparently isn't possible, so I'm forced to leave this text here instead."
byeren,60,Oyun diğer oyunlara göre beklentinin çok altında kalıyor. Warzone mi oynuyorsun hikaye modu mu belli değil. Keşke böyle olmasaydı.
Firebluetom,10,The open level design really doesn't work for MW3. You're constantly a one man army against countless baddies. I enjoy the stealth elements in the game but the execution in some levels is abysmal. There isn't too much variety between missions. The level with a timer and a missile launch is a recycle of a different level that didn't pan even close to as well. I love the shooting and sounds but the gameplay is just sooo bad I just uninstalled it.
Outonbail85,0,"Trash ah game. This is the worst and most obvious EOMM based game out. It literally forces you to lose no matter when you are on a winstreak just because of their stupid algorithm. It is pathetic and this is also an obvious pay to win game which favors those who spend money on their skins and guns, lame. The new chat bansmake it even worse. Activision is pushing their new fairy agenda all over social media and they have many gay developers so they implemented a ban if you say the (F)trash(AG). You can literally say any racial slur and not get banned but as soon as you say something that triggers their developers, you will get banned. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEU ON THIS FAIRY GAME"
zNeverSleep,60,"Boring campaign, SBMM manipulating the matches, bad UI, and strange progression make this game a lot worse than it should be. Don't get me wrong, the MP is fun, but it could be much better."
Theozp,0,the shadow ban. ALL i can say is shadow ban. and the campaingn like battlefield hardline and better. After all i believe if any one played bf campaign before oh man cod mw3 campaign is so good.
Kmryder,0,"Tudo neste jogo é ruim uma campanha medíocre e um multiplayer podre muito graças ao sbmm que simplesmente diminui o dano da arma fazendo o player perde gunfights ridiculas, este é o pior cod que tive o desprazer de joga."
Zeneko90,50,Durchwachsen würde ich sagen ... einige Missionen sind ganz interessant aber ein richtiger banger ist da nicht dabei. Das Ende ist witzlos und hat mich zum einen komplett kalt gelassen und überrumpelt.Dafür dases mittlerweile im Gamepass und ich es sozusagen kostenlos spielen konnte verträgt es schon 5 Punkte. Allerdings für jemanden der das als Vollpreis 70-80€ oder noch mehr dafür ausgegeben hat ist es halt witzlos. Ich beziehe mich auf die Singeplayer Kampagne. Alle anderen Modi wurden nicht gespielt. Bei dem Budget was Activision zur Verfügung hat ist es traurig. Die früheren CoD waren klasse. Oder auch Battlefield's zu Zeiten von Bad Company 1 und 2.
Luciferosama,100,I think I'm one of those rare people who likes the game. There's no problem with the game except that it's short.
GuillemW,0,"This game is a DLC of MW2, it's broken, has cheaters, has a shop, has battle pass (if you wanna buy it, you have to pay 30 euros each season), has skins,. I hope BO6 saves this saga a little, if the next game don't save COD, this saga will die (it's already dead). Cada vez los juegos de COD son menos jugables, solo ponen objetos para que gastes el dinero, no para que disfrutes como los antiguos juegos. Creo que reutilizaron el nombre de ""Modern Warfare"" para volver a captar la atención de los antiguos jugadores, pero lo único que han conseguido ha sido ensuciar el nombre de la saga y cagándola con cada juego que han ido sacando. Solo espero que con la salida del BO6 no la caguen y saquen un juego bueno o uno decente, que se pueda jugar tranquilamente y no esté roto desde el primer día. Nada más que decir, creo que no hay nadie contento con este juego. Solo me divierto si estoy con algún amigo, pero aún así es imposible por la cantidad de tramposos y camperos que hay."

koko12,40,"Je n'ai joué qu'à la campagne solo. Le feeling est toujours aussi bon et une poignée de missions valent le coup, mais le scénario débile se prend trop au sérieux, ça manque de scènes spectaculaires et c'est beaucoup trop court."
CaveiraFloripa,20,"The campaign is basically a tutorial for ""Warzone"", forcing multiplayer mechanics that have little to do with the campaign, which is absurd. I played it through GamePass, if I had bought it I would have already asked for a refund.I can't comment on multiplayer, I don't play it."
b95,0,"By far the biggest flop in gaming I have ever seen. The best word I could use to describe it is lazy. Just lazy. Campaign: What an absolute snooze fest. I have no words for this campaign. But boring, lazily fumbled together and disrespectful to fans. No longer do we have a crafted memorable experience. Now it is, ""Here is an open area, run around doing uninspired missions until you reach the next cutscene"". I had no desire to explore the areas given to me as they genuinely felt like they just took parts of the map made for Warzone and threw some missions on to it. Not to mention the half baked ""ending"" tacked on. Half a story, barely an ending. No impact, Boring boring boring. Zombies: Gone is the zombies we all once loved and spent 1000's of hours playing, easter egg hunting, high round attempts interesting maps and enemies. What we got was the DMZ mode with a few zombies added and the enemies ripped from Black Ops Cold War. There is NO option to play offline/solo. So due the lack of numbers in this mode, you will more often than not being playing on high ping and long wait times. Yet again, just reusing the same maps over and over in an extremely uninteresting way. MWZ is just DMZ from MW2. I'm not saying its similar. I'm saying it is quite literally DMZ from MW2 and they just added zombies. Such an incredibly disappointing experience. Multiplayer: I will 'try' keep it short otherwise I will drag on for far too long but here's the lowdown. The maps, half of them are ripped from MW2. There's half the map pool. The other maps are all such disappointing messes that I really refuse to believe have been playtested by the developers. I am unsure what the devs fascination is with extremely tiny maps, but I found that in the majority of the maps are tiny and I do mean TINY. Tiny to the point that at the start ****, within 2 seconds (if that) you will have a visual of enemies. They are essentially kill rooms and MORE often than not, you can be stuck in and endless cycle of being spawn killed. Rust is the worst for it from what I have seen where the enemies can be killed before they can even move their character or finish pulling out their gun as you can watch them spawn in. It's is mind boggling to me a multi billion dollar company can not make A) Decent spawning system B) New creative maps that aren't kill boxes. The worst part of it all from what I have seen. Is that from the map pool in the game. There are quite a few duplicates. There are 3 varients of Rust for example. They all count and are listed as separate maps. Not 1 map that has a chance to be 1 of the varients. It is 3 separate maps. Rust is not the only one. From the outlook, you would think MW3 has a lot of maps but in reality, they are maps from MW (2019) and MW2. Or varients of maps we already have. The few ""original"" maps that MW3 actually provided are nothing to write home about. They more than anything else feel like bad remakes of older Call of Duty Maps. The finish this off. This series has become nothing but a disappointing shell of what it used to be. After MW (2019) brought a lot of much needed life back to the series they had an opportunity to really do some incredible things with the series which they did briefly with the introduction of Warzone being free to play. But their greed has gotten in the way. It genuinely makes me sad to see what this game has become. Just a money hungry entity that cares NOTHING about the players that love the series. Greed has killed this game and I hope the level designers are laid off because they are doing an absolutely awful job at it."
k1erx,100,сюжет игры очень крутой не помнимаю почему все хейтят эту часть я получил ее бесплатно с xbox gamepass прошел очень понравилось много новых функций графика очень красивая локации и озвучка игра реально на высоте как по мне низкую оценку ставлят только думеры которые ждут игру как раньше со старой графикой сюжетом и всем что было раньше 10/10
tdebug,0,"Bad, very bad story mode. I have a strong feeling like campaign was added only because they wanted a ""campaign"" checkbox on the game. So very lazy script and level design and unbalanced difficulty."
ykm,0,"Weapons almost has no recoil compared to the previous games, much faster gameplay which is too arcade for me, no footsteps sounds for most cases (there is a permenant perk for it) , repulsive map variations, colorful and ridiculous operator/weapon skins and ruined hardcore mode. If you play the game tactical, this game is a joke. The game more arcade then the Fortnite. They have ruined the series. Every game is worse than previous title. Such a pity..."
denzor,30,"This is not a game, it's a mockery of the fans of the game series.3 points for cutscenes."
Nekkles,0,"Horrible. Simplemente el peor Call of Duty de la historia, y mira que no es difícil. En mi vida me ha frustrado tanto un cod, porque ya no es skill issue, es cómo se siente jugarlo, es el movimiento, las armas, los mapas y sus spawnpoints… me ponen malo. Lo había vuelto a probar desde la Beta gracias al Game pass, pero ni loco vuelvo a jugar esto. No pierdas tu tiempo en el III, el II le da mil vueltas."
Blenddd,90,Advanced fps game! Great online modes and more than multiplayer shooter. Those who give low scores have not played the game or are trying to prevent the game from being sold!
prochuuu,0,"That has to be the worst cod i've ever played. Thank god I din't have to pay for this ""something"" because it was in game pass. Actually finished totally shiet campaign and removed game. So it's like solo offline warzone or DMZ, with ""open combat missions"". They lazyness crossed every border, so the campaing don't actually engage you in story. Open map full of lootboxes and armor plates. WTF? Why my super elite soldier like Price, Soap, Ghost or Farah goes into the fight without armor plates? Are you kiddin me? Story stretched to maximum so in the next 15 games called ""modern warfare"" we'll be chasing makarov. 150 years old price still moves like a teenager. It's time to see how the games environment totally collapse and reset, because that's unacceptable, and only show's greed."
DochMurder,0,"Okay, where to start? First and foremost this series died with the release of Call of Duty in 2019 - Everything about 2019 was damn near a masterpiece when it came to gameplay, multiplayer balance, and the introduction of ""Warzone & Rebirth"" It was one of those games that you went all night with the boys on weekends. It was a game that you enjoyed making new friends on when you solo queued in and it was just exactly what every fan wanted was a Call of Duty that felt exactly right, am I right? Fast forward to where we are now. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. The beta gave me personally a glimmering hope of something that could be relatable to the series in 2019. It felt balanced, the TTK seemed perfect, and the gameplay was an exciting time. With classic maps returning like Rust and the Devs lettings us continue to go ham leveling up guns for camo grinds in shipment. Well, they screwed up, shocking surprise? We all know this series is the best out there because it is the only one out there! Not hard when you are in the ranks by yourself to be number 1 worldwide. They botched the TTK with ""balance"" Updates and when it was time to drop into warzone? Yikes, it was all about meta weapon loadouts and collecting all the amor you can hold. There is no balance to this load of crap in Warzone or Rebirth. Head glitching, breaking all the armor but finding your enemy surviving and still having just the worst audio in the business. You can't expect much from a franchise that has been so successful to make any major changes when it’s all the money they collect. Yes, I am talking about the operator skins! Let’s talk about that for a moment. Whoever is behind the design of these skins has some mental issues going on and needs to fired or at least the company should look at what goes into the store prior to selling. The Celeb operators are whatever but even those are just designed poorly. I am not sure if they were going for a Fortnite like store with these ""cool edgy"" skins, but they ****, they look like crap, and when the game is crap you are just okay playing crap and being in crap. Why are there skins in the game where we have Lazer melee weapons? Oh, cause Gundam in Call of Duty just makes sense? What the heck is a wobbly? These money cash grabbing Devs can literally kick rocks. They rather make money off these horrible skins that literally look like a dog crapped it out then balance out a game that used to be amazing. Nothing about the armor system in Warzone & Rebirth makes sense. No one wants to continue pumping bullets into someone and just seeing that you cracked them for just all their armor and repeat over and over till whoever runs out or gets third partied. Sure, there are some good times still to be made but for me, it’s not worth it. I have finally uninstalled this trash game and I couldn't be happier, that’s where the 1 star comes in because I was able to just uninstall and be thrilled to have well over 200gbs back for other games that are worth the hard drive space. Games like Battlefield 2042 have adjusted and fixed their mistakes and it’s loads of fun! I have always been a fan of that series and I really hope they jump back into the scene and wish more FPS shooters would consider playing it or giving it another shot. It looks better, costs less space on hard drives and best yet, you can aim, shoot. and watch your enemy drop as you get a kill. Massive maps and the player population is coming back with full lobbies every time I join up and play. No skins, no stupid stoners who never played COD in their lives, no celebrities. It’s just run and gun fun with a war mentality of mayhem from the sea to the skies. It’s fun, its better, and it will hopefully realize how much garbage Call of Duty is and will remain as these greedy DEVS don't care whatsoever and we stupid people will just play and get our hopes up every time we think ""Oh this is the one, it’s going to be amazing"" You know it, I for sure know it, it will break your heart and let you down. CoD is dead and we should start knowing it will never be what the gamers want"
Carlos_Veloso,0,"This game is the worst FPS ever made besides it's good **** somebody is new to the game it'll not take long to start queueing with obvious cheaters that don't even try to hide that they're cheating. Only if you're a known streamer in activisions payroll you'll have bot lobbies to make some COD content for twitch or youtube. They give them a soft aimbot made by activision developpers to enhance your aim and probably others ehnancement softwares to make a difference. I'm almost sure that the problem is not only ricochet anti-cheat, I'm almost sure that activision works with cheaters and hackers to proporcionate a bad experience for the players activision dislikes. If you're not an streamer or a cod pro in activision's payroll you'll suffer at this game. Lobby after lobby, game after game, the same cheater and hackers are queued in the same lobby has I'm and I'm not banned and the worst is that they're never banned too. That's why I believe they work with activision. I'll never buy a call of duty game, it's not fun at all, besides, the game is completely rigged by the devellopers. It's the one's that the publisher chooses that are going to be the ""COD Pros or Streamers"". With that status one hand washes the other, activision pay to their pros and streamers and give them the wins. Activision pre selects the teams that are going to win tournaments, through the public opinion statistics to make them waste their money in this game that is completely rigged. And this will never be a competitive FPS when it's rigged. Activision vision of games has destroyed gaming for now, maybe their games forever. I hope everyone go inside this fraudulent franchise and see with their own eyes what is a corrupt system of gaming lead by greed people without sentiments. Minors playing a game full of violence innapropriate for their age, toxic community, everything is toxic in this game, trust me, you'll not have any fun playing it, you can for a while but, at long run you'll see that is a waste of time and money. I hope my review as been helpfull for the people who's considering playing the game."
DrkTheNewGuy,10,"A campaign set in a warzone map, horrible story with dull characters. This campaign is one of if not the worst campaign Call of Duty has ever put out. Warzone Zombies may be new but it is a bad mix, most of the gameplay is just me running around trying to complete basic objectives. The multiplayer atleast is fun, and has been in years, the only thing consistent about this franchise. The graphics is also good, if it wasnt so satisfying playing this would be like watching grass grow. This is basically a DLC masquerading as a full game. And the only thing MWIII succeeded at is making me want to play the older games. It is that bad"
Chikara_66844,0,"Als Liebhaber von Videospielen möchte ich eine ehrliche Bewertung zu Call of Duty abgeben, und ich muss sagen, ich bin zutiefst enttäuscht. Dieses Spiel verdient es nicht einmal, auf den Müllhaufen der Videospielgeschichte geworfen zu werden - es ist wie der unangenehme Geruch in einem überfüllten Zug, den man nicht loswird. Wo soll ich anfangen? Nun, wie wäre es damit, dass das Spiel Campern Tür und Tor öffnet, als wären sie die Könige des Schlachtfeldes? Ich meine, ernsthaft, wer braucht schon Geschicklichkeit und Taktik, wenn man einfach nur in einer Ecke sitzen und auf ahnungslose Gegner warten kann? Es ist eine Schande, dass solche passiven Spielweisen belohnt werden, während diejenigen, die sich tatsächlich bemühen, das Spiel zu genießen und zu gewinnen, wie die Deppen dastehen. Und dann haben wir die Behandlung der alten Hasen in der Call-of-Duty-Community. Diejenigen, die seit den Anfängen dabei waren, werden wie Müll behandelt. Anstatt ihre Erfahrung und Expertise anzuerkennen, werden sie von den Entwicklern und einem Teil der Spielerschaft wie Relikte aus einer längst vergessenen Zeit behandelt. Es ist, als ob ihre Hingabe und ihr Fachwissen nichts wert sind, nur weil sie sich nicht auf den neuesten Trend einlassen. Und natürlich darf man nicht die Geldgier der Entwickler und Herausgeber von Call of Duty vergessen. Es ist offensichtlich, dass das Hauptziel nicht darin besteht, ein qualitativ hochwertiges Spielerlebnis zu bieten, sondern vielmehr, den Spielern das Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen, wann immer sich die Gelegenheit bietet. Insgesamt ist Call of Duty ein trauriges Beispiel dafür, wie Geldgier die Integrität eines Spiels beeinträchtigen kann. Anstatt sich auf Qualität und Spielerzufriedenheit zu konzentrieren, wird hier klar, dass der Profit über alles andere steht. Es ist eine Schande und ein trauriger Abstieg für eine einst so angesehene Marke."
Siarap,100,"Im not skilled player only 1.47kd. Thank god for the sbmm. ""10"" For sbmm in cod .If next cod will not have sbmm i will not buy it anymore. Good job gujs keep it up. Ofcourse this game has cons but sbmm is wonderfull for me. Maybe not for those loud high skilled streamers if they loose on **** this must be pain to loose on stream. But silent low skilled players have no voice. I have very much fun thanks to the sbmm, and cheaters plays against cheaters."
Mr_Mieze,0,"It's the same **** as every year. Nothing new, just PaytoWin and money-hungry developers"
sebastianvettel,0,This game is very bad because it has a **** story mode( I dont care online part). Characters are uneffective and there is no memorable scene. I miss the old call of duty's I hope one day we will see games like old call of dutys
duendemago,10,"I give it one because it has some decent MP and an average campaign. Saying that: how could they screwed a very well developed game (visually,movement, sound, etc) such as MWF2019 and left us with a super bad sound design (no footsteps, the overal weapon sound is super trash, the atmospheric sound is low quality) and also with a joke of spawns. For people who enjoys more MP than Warzone that is just unacceptable. Then, Warzone: what a joke! the game doesnt look that good and the game mechanics is just ridicoulus: ultra fast time to kill with people moving faster than light, super annoying and boring. How people inflates that bad developed game mode? It is horrible! Not buying a COD again, only playing if it comes in Game Pass. What a joke of development and Activision as a company lost all my respect with all its little baby studios."
MantikorNV,10,"Let's start with the fact that this is not a full-fledged game, but a small add-on for MWII. Asking 70 euros for it is such audacity that I have never encountered before. The maximum price for this ""game"" should be 20 euros. I apologize for using the word ""game"", of course. There are tons of bugs in this ""product"", many of which have been there since release and still haven't been fixed. And there are hundreds of thousands (yes, HUNDREDS of thousands) of cheaters in the game. Sometimes the publisher conducts waves of bans for 20,000-50,000 accounts at a time. But they admit that they don't ban everyone and not even on the first attempt. Imagine how many cheaters remain in the game. The zombie mode turned out to be complete nonsense, support for which the developers abandoned as early as the second season. And there's nothing more in the ""game"". I strongly advise against buying this ""game"" and feeding untalented developers."
magemaster,10,"I was playing Call of duty games since 2009 and all i can say now literally downfall of the COD. Gameplay hasn't change, recycling the maps can only say they have no idea what to make next, only 3 maps for the ground war is laughable. So far all events were disappointing. Back in MW19 haunting event was dope giving all the fun to the game. Vanguard era even tho vanguard was bad but Operation Monarch event was the greatest ever so far. Nothing new for the game rather than bunch of bundles every week to gain money. Dark days of the COD"
cheese1,40,"Modern warfare 3 is overall not very good, I only kinda liked the multiplayer and warzone. I will give it that the original maps that they made for this game and pretty nice, like stash house,and das haus. I dont like that about 60% of the lobbys i go into for multiplayer and warzone, there is a person using some sort of hacks like aimbot, wall hacks, no recoil, etc. Zombies wasnt very good because i prefer round based zombies and I dont want to have to grind for several days just to have a decent expirence."
thomate18,0,DON'T BUY IT AND DON'T BUY ANY SKINS IN GAME worst COD i have ever played too short campaign mutliplayer full of 0 fun tryhard ( if don't tryhard you're gonna die everytime you spawn) overpowerd meta : there is more than 60 guns in the game and i only see the sames one in the my games (the meta one of course)SBMM and script ruin everything
Ronove,0,"If you are a strong player then you will be banned. (The angry people you killed will report you, after a few reports, you will be banned. Congratulations, nice **** game.) COD = scam."
MechanixX,0,"arguably the worst fps of all time. every cod nowadays as gradually worse than the one before it. its probably the only constant there is within this series now aside from constantly recycled assets and content. nothing but a copy/paste job and they still manage to blow it every time. cheaters run rampant as ever, and as usual they do nothing about it. ricochet is nothing but a placebo, it doesnt actually do anything, map design is absolutely terrible, they even managed to mess up the classic maps. how? they were already done. weapons are terribly balanced, spawns are horribly placed, spawn killing is frequent and a major problem. awful game. this is the last cod ill ever get. mw2 was awful, but this.... this is a pile of garbage that i just wont even bother with any more."
theonelog,50,"The main saving grace for this game is the multiplayer. It is extremely fun and seems to be the strong suit of Sledgehammer games. The campaign, however, is terrible and completely destroyed the potential the new Modern Warfare storyline. Zombies is mediocre but I won't doc too many points off because I personally prefer round based zombies."

charlesdugal,0,"Ce jeu est basé sur le monde qui ont de la difficulté avec leur aim. Call of duty aide a 90% le monde a viser sur les joueurs et ça même si ceux-ci ne les voit pas, ils peuvent compter sur le aim assist... les joueurs de consoles ont tout simplement l'avantage, mais ce n'est pas tout. Le jeu rencontre énormément de difficulté avec le son, les lag comme étant des objectifs qui sont dans le sol, des guns invisibles, la latence, on ne peut plus se plater, etc, il en a pleins d'autres. Sans compter les cheater. De plus en plus qu'ils sortent des MW, de plus en plus qu'ils perdent leur bonne communauté!"
Monkeycharlie,10,Wtf This game bad man where is the mw 3 2011 ???? evet bu oyunu alacak türk arkadaşlarım almayın paranıza zamanınıza yazık gidin 2011 yılında çıkanı oynayın.
kmudge,20,"Cannot recommend at all! Gamemodes are reused and/or **** in general. Weapons and damages are ridiculous and nonsensical. DMZ was a bit fun, but has been abandoned. Zombies is OK, but there are much better coop games out there. Only reason I have it and play it is because my friend wants to play and bought it for me."
RavenovSerega,90,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Thinkscape,0,"AVOID! The best parts of MW2 multiplayer like DMZ are now gone. What's back is overwhelming number of boring vanila feeling guns, copy-pasta old multiplayer modes, shortest and most underbaked single player campaign in history of this **** has since been leaked that the game was rushed, and it shows. It's not worth $15 as an extension to MW2, let alone the current retail price."
skylar445,0,The amount of people using hacks/cheats is off the charts. Never have I played a first person shooter where 30 percent of the playerbase is using hacks.
LcsFlores,0,Lots of bugs (graphical and game play). Always crashing on MWZ. PC players have to play against Aim bot assist controller users. Terrible experience on multiplayer on PC due to crossplay and aim bot assist. Yearly realease. No progression. Threw my money on garbage. First and last COD I buy.
RustY420,60,"Well, it is more than a DLC, than a new game, with a multiplayer focus rather than story... But if you buy it with a discount, and cry yourself out how much money you spent on this game, and after crying more it is an amazing game. It is reused many game elements, we all see this elsewhere... iPhones for example do the same and we still buy the newest one. I don't and never will like how the story is ""Open Mission"" and you run and gun... But this is a next gen game.. I will always love and never forget the original Modern Warfare trilogy. That is indeed the OG. This one is for the graphics, and to find lobby..."
Kariack,10,"Setting aside that this game is a literal DLC that they are trying to pass off as a full game, let me describe what your play experience will be like: Start off the match doing well? You will get nerfed mid-game. You will start to have ""packet burst"" icons come up. BUT DONT WORRY if you have your network settings showing, that will say 0 packet loss, but you'll still be lagging :) Oh, you can still be good when lagging? They will change your hit detection and weapon damage mid-game. For example, let's say you're using a largely one-shot weapon like the Longbow. You start off the game hitting shots and they are all one-shot kills. You are feeling great, the game knows you're feeling great. You know who isn't feeling great? The **** on the other team. What happens next? You land the same shot you've hit hundreds of times before, but this time? Hit marker. You fire again. Dead on in the chest. Bullet doesn't register. The **** finally wakes up and turns around and kills you in one frame with a pistol. How you ask? Is it 19th century netcode? Is it EOMM manipulating your experience? Is someone using scripts? Who knows?! We surely never will. The developers continue to make promises to keep you playing, but never follow through. Overall, if you want a game to literally manipulate your experience, and make you feel like ****. This is the game for you. If you want a classic call of duty experience to have fun? Stay as far away as you can. I should mention as well. This is my first Call of Duty in a LONG time (Black Ops 3). I bought into their scam of marketing techniques and wanted to play the remastered MW2 maps that were supposed to be in the remastered MW2 multiplayer that now we will never get. My prior experiences with Call of Duty may have had minor SBMM but certainly did not have EOMM. Before anyone says ""oh so you just want to beat up bad people?"" no. Just no. I like a bit of competition in the lobbies, but what I don't like is my experience being manipulated in real-time to get me frustrated because they know that frustrated players keep playing to prove themselves. In summary, reasons you should NOT ever buy this game: - it's a DLC - their anti-cheat does not work, and you will never understand how you die. - The game is essentially spyware at this point. They monitor your voice, your inputs, and anything else they can. (read their patents) If you're on console this is even worse. - Activision has no incentive to ever make a good game again because people just keep buying it. - Their UI/UX experience is purposefully manipulative to make you randomly end up in the shop. -They don't fix bugs -They added revenge spawning so you will have people spawn LITERALLY right behind you so it makes them happy :) - You games are rigged and scripted. It follows a typical pattern. The beginning of the match will be close. Then the team that is supposed to win will start having their spawn advantage. You hold A and just captured B? Now they are spawning at A and instant capping to keep you at 1 flag. You move to capture C in response? Someone spawns behind you and keeps C safe. Don't worry, your team gets a mid-game buff to make the score inch closer and make sure you don't quit. THEN in the last 30% of the match, it will switch back to the other team and you will get stomped for the rest. It's a typical story curve. Please save yourself $70, and your happiness. Don't touch this game. Don't buy Call of Duty. Help smaller dev teams finally create a Call of Duty competitor. Old Call of Duty is never coming back. Call of Duty will never be a quality game again."
Redneb,0,"This game is pure trash. Read the patent for the matchmaking: when you buy stuff in the shop you get a really good gaming experience shortly after. I had matches with 5+ k/d on an invasion map where I played against BOTS that didn't even shoot back. After that game I got into lobbies where I ended up with 0.1 k/d getting totally destroyed. The matchmaking is the worst I have every experienced and I played Overwatch 2, and thought this was trash. MW3 is a shop with a game attached. Unstable, unoptimized, bugged und infested with cheaters. Well done Newbievision, well done."
