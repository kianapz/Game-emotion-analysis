Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-25,"i have been a die hard fan of overwatch since release, i'm a collector of all things overwatch, avid reader of lore and just love all the characters in this game. but if you are a new player and are thinking of getting into this game...i would suggest you look elsewhere, the game doesn't allow for you to have any fun, it is constantly in competitive mode even in quick play. you aren't even allowed to leave casual quickplay games without the game putting you into a temporary ban. when the stars align and everything goes right,this game feels euphoric and addicting, but that is few an far between and the times in between make you feel so low you just don't know what to do with yourself. tldr if you want to feel like an addict, trying to get that next high, with awful times in between, overwatch might just be your game."

Shooter,Overwatch 2,2025-01-11,"honestly just don't do it to yourself, i view my overwatch addiction like how league of legends treats you. you dont end up playing and having fun most of the time but just being tilted at the matchmaking, long queue times, lazy recolors shitty monetization practices and toxic community. this games used to be the bees knees ngl, overwatch one back in the day was a great time and i think a lot of us stick around for the nostalgia at this point. this game really shines with cooperative team play utilizing comms but the way the community has devolved at this point most have resorted to full muting all text chats and not joining voice even in ranked games while profiles are default on full private. playing this game solo is exhausting and i have noticed a concerning increase of blatant cheating. hopefully blizzard can turn things around as the game at its core is good and runs smooth as butter, its just proceed with caution atm if you are coming into this as a new player."
Shooter,Overwatch 2,2024-12-25,"i have been a die hard fan of overwatch since release, i'm a collector of all things overwatch, avid reader of lore and just love all the characters in this game. but if you are a new player and are thinking of getting into this game...i would suggest you look elsewhere, the game doesn't allow for you to have any fun, it is constantly in competitive mode even in quick play. you aren't even allowed to leave casual quickplay games without the game putting you into a temporary ban. when the stars align and everything goes right,this game feels euphoric and addicting, but that is few an far between and the times in between make you feel so low you just don't know what to do with yourself. tldr if you want to feel like an addict, trying to get that next high, with awful times in between, overwatch might just be your game."
