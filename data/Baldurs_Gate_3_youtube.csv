@juansubiry99,Commented on the hexblade post that extra attack was a pact feature not hexblade specific and they blocked me lmao,0
@thefugetive1979,"My hole game broken, and after update can't play anymore, this is pure shit",0
@slendergod95,"I've done it, I reinstalled the game... My mod for the stronger slayer has now been removed from the downloadable mods. My 170 hours save file is now gone... I can reload the 125 hours though. The most painful first run ever",0
@Nannapolisher,Mighty Impel looks nasty af welcome back Barrelmancy,0
@mrfigs7804,I like how it sound like you have to burp.,3
@drakeshotplays,YeH just causually uninstall and reinstall a 150 GB game SMH üòÇ,0
@itsmorgan10,GIANT,0
@xdoubt4113,"So I have a high half-elf swashbuckler rogue who took booming blade as his free cantrip in DnD 5e, would love to remake that! The question will be if I can booming blade and sneak attack together in this game...Only time will tell!",0
@sheujade,Seems that every video I am interested lately is made by you lmao. Thank you for taking the time to make this video. Very informative. I am subscribed...keep em coming :D,3
@incognitoinhell8742,"Just a heads up - They'll likely be removing Patch 8 from PS5 at some point, as it's not officially released to the public yet, and therefore likely isn't finished, either. Also any saves you use will not be compatible with Patch 7, something Larian explicitly stated, suggesting they will be taking it down, once they find out how it got released early anyway. So if you do try to play about with the new stuff, whilst it's on PS5, please, for your sake, use a new save file, or a finished save file, as you won't be able to go back to it, once Larian takes the patch down.",0
@gagemg2758,Does anybody know when this will actually release?,0
@tiradentes4525,Shadow Sorcerer?,0
@juliandavila24,Any idea when patch 8 will be out?,0
@sonnitude,‚Ä¶ I wonder if you can enlarge a giant bard through a spell or elixir and have it stack with this.,1
@arandomzy,"Woah, surprised by Ciri",0
@Vrince.,So i got the update but before i could return to patch 7 i got into the stress test so still on patch 8 here,0
@AndrewCyrilThomas,Currently installing patch 8 for the stress test on xbox!,1
@robertbuchanan7609,I hate the just uninstall reinstall fix.  Xfinity/comcast data cap your downloads. Thats a huge rant for another day.  Cant wait for the real patch 8 drop.,0
@noctrk161,"It's seems like the Giant barbarian is not as op as modded version (they can't change their damage type to elemental). Swashbuckler and Arcane archer look very cool and fun. Swashbuckler has some neat crowd control actions and Arcane Archer rivals the Battlemaster in versatility, even suppresses it at ranged for sure. The other subclasses look pretty basic and boring. Especially the Hexblade is kinda pointless now, because any Warlock can use it's Charisma in melee. Maybe for 1 level dip for paladin is ok, but even then it's better just to drink strength potions.",0
@BurningSovereign,Why no kensei?,0
@Norion_Artifice,"So by the screenshot, Bladesinger gets a normal Extra Attack, booming blade is a free smite, is compatible with longswords and therefore GWM... a pally dip for smites and roll those dice!",1
@redyeti2468,booming blade finally EK will be more than just spelltank with this,3
@MrBooghyMan,With the new Booming Blade cantrip eldritch knight will finally be able to use War Magic...YAY,13
@sonharriswhatup3207,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Console players WHERE IS IT FOR US ?!?!?!?!?! COME ON MAN üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,0
@kurisu2003,If it was me i would be really careful. I get people can be curious but don't just download something your ps5 can't even scan for a virus or anything. It's not like a computer. I would've found it suspicious and wouldn't download the patch just because something that just randomly gets released out and it wasn't ready to be released to everyone. Let alone it was only on ps5 and not on xbox or pc in the same areas. You can't tell what you are installing on a console. Someone could've sent a virus or something in that patch without anyone knowing. It's just something you should always be careful of. Especially if the ones who said they don't know how it got released in those areas.,0
@Arcantik,‚ÄúMondays am i right‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt like fast enough,3
@jedimasterren5520,6 levels with Bladesinging wizard and 6 levels with light domain cleric would be pretty strong.,0
@mauriciogoncalves3914,I think the final version will be quite different.,6
@syreallewyatt5048,Really cute character at the end *color me jealous*,3
@oranguman9360,Guys maybe you could help me out- what would multiclass well with giant barbarian? I was thinking thief but might impel only comes online at level 10.,0
@theopinson3851,Lol what the heck‚Ä¶?,0
@Kwakikoola,I feel like all these new subclasses are getting so much more attention than some of the existing subclasses,6
@jbwolf4,"I was wondering what happened this morning! Reddit was going crazy lmao. 

Also glamour bard is SO GOOD at supporting your party, granting people extra movement without provoking opportunity attacks is huge for controlling combat.",2
@carpenternathaniel7461,You had me so damn excited ffs,3
@boxturtlebruce6110,I have 2 characters paused at level 3 just waiting for swashbuckler and arcane archer to drop third character slot will be for hexblade,0
@johnnythedark3090,Booming blade - that's the thing that made eldrich knight playable.,8
@Ashes_to_Ashes200,"Wait so you said nothing on Paladin yet, but I also don't see anything on Sorcerer. Are they just completely skipping over them for patch 8?!",0
@kevindimas253,Subclasses that have my attention are drunken master swashbuckler and hexblade,1
@dylanreed9792,When do you anticipate the stress test invites will be sent out?,1
@SONICgokuverine,Guess that means it‚Äôs pretty close to being ready to go.,9
@NPC-rq6vn,"It would be tempting to make a swashbuckler rogue and not yell, ""pocket sand"" every time you use the sand toss ability.",17
@tonytheturtle8555,"I haven't been paying attention to recent mod drops for console, have there been any updates on race mods by any of the mod authors?",0
@MrVilla124,"So I‚Äôve played an extra 7 hours on patch 8 before realising I had to reinstall the game. Does this mean I won‚Äôt be able to continue my save  indefinitely now, or will it possibly work when patch 8 is out? I got lots done and now I have to replay it all üòÖ.",4
@ch.kv.,"Thanks for the updates, any guesses on how long major mods will take to work correctly with patch 8, after it releases officially? Should we expect a few weeks of broken/buggy gameplay for modded runs on patch 8 when it drops? Not sure if I can hold out too much longer for my next playthrough lol",0
@Luckysquirrel1256,"Really curious to see how the astral forms with Druid work, if it is just a buff like with Spore Druid or if it you actually change forms.",4
@Thunderstrike10,"i think this is the only video on the patch 8 info, thank you!!",31
@joanhammond7261,I have it on my ps5 do I need delete bg3 and download again or can keep patch thing?,1
@anna45333,Any idea when exactly this patch 8 will be availiable on Steam? (thankfully i managed to complete the game just a couple of days ago (and i have even posted my ending here in youtube) So i am eager for the patch 8. No problems here. :),1
@HedlessChickn,i have never appreciated a pause button more.,0
